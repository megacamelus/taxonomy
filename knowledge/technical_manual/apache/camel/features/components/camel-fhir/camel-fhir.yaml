    - question: 'What is the default value and data type, as well as whether it is a required or optional configuration option, for the "encoding" setting in the Apache Camel Fhir component, and which group does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "encoding" setting in the Apache Camel FHIr component is null. It is of type string and can be configured but is not a required option. This configuration option belongs to the common group.'
    - question: 'What is the default version of the FHIR used in the Apache Camel component "fhir" when the option "fhirVersion" is not specified explicitly, and is it a required or optional parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The default version of the FHIR used in the Apache Camel component "fhir" when the option "fhirVersion" is not specified explicitly is R4. It is an optional parameter.'
    - question: 'How do I configure the `fhir` Apache Camel component to log every request and response in a non-mandatory manner, and what is the default value of this option if not explicitly set?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the `fhir` Apache Camel component to log every request and response in a non-mandatory manner, you need to set the "log" option to true. This can be done by including the following line in your route configuration:              ```xml       <propertyPropertyName="fhirLog" value="true"/>       ```              In case this option is not explicitly set, its default value will remain as false.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''prettyPrint'' option in the Apache Camel FHIR component, its default value, and whether it is required when using this component? Also, could you explain how to enable pretty printing for all requests in FHIR using Camel?'
      answer: |
       'The ''prettyPrint'' option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is a boolean configuration parameter that, when set to true, will format the output of all FHIR-related requests in a readable and indented manner (often referred to as pretty print). Its default value is false. This option is not mandatory; its usage depends on whether you wish to make the response more easily readable for debugging or analysis purposes.              To enable pretty printing for all FHIR requests when using Camel, you can set the ''prettyPrint'' option to true in your routing configuration. Here is an example of how it might be done:              ```java       from("direct:start")           .to(fhirComponent("org.apache.camel.component.fhir2")               .prettyPrint(true));       ```              In this code snippet, we are setting the ''prettyPrint'' option to true for all requests coming from a direct endpoint named "start".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value (if any), data type, requirement status, and potential group affiliation of the option "serverUrl" in the Apache Camel component named "fhir"?'
      answer: |
       'The "serverUrl" option within the Apache Camel component named "fhir" serves as the base URL for the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) server. By default, it has no predefined value. Its data type is string, and its requirement status is optional, meaning it''s not necessary to provide a value for its functionality. This option may belong to the "common" group in the configuration setup.'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel FHIR component''s bridgeErrorHandler option function, when set to true, compared to its default behavior when not specified or set to false, in terms of exception handling for incoming messages?'
      answer: |
       'When the Apache Camel FHIR component''s `bridgeErrorHandler` option is set to true, it allows for bridging exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages to be processed as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler. This is not the default behavior when `bridgeErrorHandler` is not specified or set to false. In its default state, the consumer uses the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler` to deal with exceptions, which are logged at WARN or ERROR level and then ignored. However, when `bridgeErrorHandler` is set to true, these exceptions are transformed into messages, enabling better handling and possibly recovery of the situation. It''s essential to note that this feature is only available if the 3rd party component supports notifying Camel about any thrown exceptions; some components may handle errors internally and thus `bridgeErrorHandler` may not be an option for them.'
    - question: 'How does setting the Apache Camel FHIR component''s "lazyStartProducer" option to true affect the startup behavior of the producer, and what potential trade-offs are associated with this configuration choice?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the Apache Camel FHIR component''s "lazyStartProducer" option to true allows for a deferred start of the producer. This means that the producer will not be started immediately during the routing context startup, but rather on the first message processed. By adopting this approach, it''s possible to handle situations where starting the producer might otherwise fail and cause the route to fail during startup.              However, there are trade-offs associated with this configuration choice. When the "lazyStartProducer" is set to true, the initial processing of the first message may take a bit longer as creating and starting the producer will occur at that time, thus prolonging the total processing time. It''s important to consider these potential delays when using lazy start, especially in scenarios where quick response times are crucial.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and whether it is required for enabling autowiring in the Apache Camel fhir component''s "autowiredEnabled" option? Also, provide a brief explanation of this option and its possible usage scenarios.'
      answer: |
       'The default value for enabling autowiring in the Apache Camel FHIR component''s "autowiredEnabled" option is true, meaning autowiring is activated by default. This option allows for automatic autowiring of certain options when marked as autowired, by looking up in the registry to find a single instance of matching type and configuring it onto the component. This can be beneficial for automatically configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, or similar resources. However, using this option is considered an advanced feature and its usage is not required if manual configuration suits your needs better.'
    - question: 'What are the steps to configure and use a custom FHIR client in Apache Camel when working with advanced settings?'
      answer: |
       'To configure and use a custom FHIR client in Apache Camel for advanced settings, follow these steps:              1. Define an object representing your custom FHIR client according to the provided JSON schema `{"component":"fhir","option":"client","description":"To use the custom client","defaultValue":null,"type":"object","required":false,"groups":"advanced"}`.              2. Instantiate the object with appropriate FHIR client details in your Camel route. For example:              ```       FhirClient customClient = new DefaultFhirClient();       customClient.setBaseUri("https://your-fhir-server.com/");       // Configure additional settings as per your requirements.              ProducerTemplate template = context.createProducerTemplate();       FhirEndpoint fhirEndpoint = new FhirEndpoint("fhir:" + FhirRestOperations.REST.getId());       fhirEndpoint.setComponent(new FhirComponent());       fhirEndpoint.setFhirClient(customClient); // Set your custom client instance       template.send(fhirEndpoint, exchange);       ```              3. Integrate the produced component in the Camel route as follows:              ```       from("direct:start")         .to(fhirEndpoint)         ...;       ```'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and configuration method of the Apache Camel fhir component option "clientFactory", and is it mandatory to provide a default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientFactory" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is an advanced feature that allows you to use a custom client factory for creating FHIR clients. Providing a custom client factory can be beneficial if you have specific requirements for creating instances of FHIR clients beyond the default options provided. However, it is not mandatory to provide a default value for this option; using the default client factory will suffice if your needs do not require a custom implementation. This configuration is part of the advanced group of settings in Camel, meaning it may be less commonly used compared to other options.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "compress" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component and does it have a required status in its configuration, as well as which group of options does it belong to within the advanced settings?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "compress" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is false, and it has a non-required status in its configuration. This option can be found in the "advanced" group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the method to enable the shared configuration for the Apache Camel FHIR component, and is it optional or required? (It''s enabled using an object and is optional.)'
      answer: |
       'The method to enable the shared configuration for the Apache Camel FHIR component is by providing an object in your configuration. It''s important to note that this is an optional feature, not a requirement. This means you can use the component without the shared configuration if desired. However, to utilize the shared configuration, make sure you group it under the "advanced" settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the connection timeout (in milliseconds) in the advanced settings of the Apache Camel Fhir component when attempting to establish an initial TCP connection?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the connection timeout (in milliseconds) in the advanced settings of the Apache Camel FHIR component when trying to establish an initial TCP connection is 10000 milliseconds.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "deferModelScanning" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component, and what is its default value when not specified? Is it required for the basic functionality of the component, or does it fall under advanced options?'
      answer: |
       'The "deferModelScanning" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is an advanced feature that allows you to delay the scanning of model classes for their children until the child list for a given type is explicitly accessed. This means that when this option is enabled, it can help improve performance by reducing initial loading times. It''s important to note that this option is not necessary for the basic functionality of the component; instead, it is intended for more sophisticated use cases where performance optimization is desired. The default value of this option is false, meaning that model classes are scanned automatically when the component starts up.'
    - question: 'What is the recommended practice to optimize performance when using the FhirContext option in the Apache Camel''s FHIR component, if not providing a default value for it?'
      answer: |
       'To optimize performance while working with the FHIRContext option in Apache Camel''s FHIR component, it is recommended to set the FhirContext object directly rather than creating multiple instances. This approach helps reduce overhead during runtime and improves overall application efficiency, as described in the advanced group documentation.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the Apache Camel FHIR component''s forceConformanceCheck option, and is it required or optional? (Answer: False, Optional)'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "forceConformanceCheck" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is false. This setting, which controls whether to enforce conformance checking during resource validation, is considered optional as it falls under the advanced group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "sessionCookie" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component and does it have a default value? Also, is its usage considered an advanced feature due to its specific group classification?'
      answer: |
       'The "sessionCookie" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is designed to add an HTTP session cookie to every request. This option is not mandatory as it has a default value of null, meaning no session cookie will be added if no explicit value is provided. Its usage is considered an advanced feature as it is classified under the "advanced" group in the component''s options.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the Apache Camel component FHIR''s "socketTimeout" option, which specifies the duration to block for individual read/write operations in milliseconds, and is optional within the advanced group of configurations?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel component FHIR''s "socketTimeout" option is 10000 (milliseconds). It is an integer type variable that specifies the duration to block for individual read/write operations, and it falls under the advanced group of configurations.'
    - question: 'How can you use the ''summary'' option in the Apache Camel FHIR component to request the server to modify its response based on the ''_summary'' parameter? Is it mandatory to set a value for this option and what groups of users are considered advanced enough to make use of this feature?'
      answer: |
       'To utilize the ''summary'' option in the Apache Camel FHIR component, you can modify your configuration to include this parameter when interacting with the server. By setting the ''_summary'' param, you request the server to adjust its response to comply with the _summary attribute''s semantics. However, it''s important to note that a default value is not provided for this option, allowing flexibility in determining what value best suits your specific use case. Users in advanced groups who have proficient knowledge of FHIR and Camel configuration settings are typically those who can make effective use of this feature.'
    - question: 'What are the possible values and the default value for the "validationMode" option in the Apache Camel Fhir component, and can it be set to non-default values under advanced group configuration, and if yes, what scenario would typically warrant such a configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "validationMode" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component has a default value of "ONCE". This means that validation of the FHIR Server''s conformance statement will occur once during its lifecycle. However, it can be set to other string values under the advanced group configuration. A scenario where setting it to a non-default value might be appropriate is when continuous or periodic validation of the conformance statement is required, such as in situations demanding high assurance about the server''s adherence to FHIR specifications over time.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "proxyHost" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component, and are there any specific groupings it belongs to?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyHost" option within the Apache Camel FHIR component is a configurable string parameter that defines the proxy host. This setting allows the component to send requests through an intermediary server if necessary, which can help facilitate communication with certain servers or networks. It should be noted that the default value for this option is null, meaning no specific proxy host is set by default. The "proxyHost" option belongs to a specific grouping called "proxy". This grouping encompasses settings related to proxies within the Apache Camel FHIR component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "proxyPassword" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component, and is its use associated with a specific group of options?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyPassword" option within the Apache Camel FHIR component serves as a placeholder for storing proxy passwords. Its default value is null, meaning you''ll need to provide a non-empty string if you want to use it. This option belongs to the group of options designated as "proxy", indicating its purpose is related to managing proxies.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, and group association of the Apache Camel Fhir component option named "proxyPort"? Furthermore, is this option required?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel FHIR component''s "proxyPort" option serves as a configurable port for proxy connections. It does not have a default value (defaultValue: null). This option belongs to the "proxy" group of settings. Lastly, using the "proxyPort" is optional, as it has a "required" value of false.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, type, and whether it''s required to use the ''proxyUser'' option in the Apache Camel Fhir component, and which group of options does it belong to if a user chooses not to provide a proxy username?'
      answer: |
       'The ''proxyUser'' option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is a string type that serves as the proxy username. It is not mandatory to use this option, as it has a default value of null. If you choose not to specify a proxy username, it falls under the ''proxy'' group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, requirement (whether it''s required or not), and associated group of the "accessToken" option within the Apache Camel Fhir component for security purposes?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessToken" option within the Apache Camel FHIr component serves as a placeholder for an OAuth access token. It is optional, meaning it has no default value. This option is of data type string. From a grouping perspective, it falls under the "security" category, indicating its role in maintaining secure communications.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and if it is required to use the ''password'' option in the Apache Camel component ''fhir'' for basic authentication? And what group does this option belong to under the security category?'
      answer: |
       'The ''password'' option in the Apache Camel FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) component is used for basic authentication purposes. Its default value is null, meaning you need to provide a password explicitly if you want to use it for authentication. Regarding data type, this option belongs to the string category. Lastly, the ''password'' option falls under the security group, indicating its importance in ensuring the secure transfer of healthcare data.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and required status of the Apache Camel component "fhir" option named "username", and in which group does it belong according to the provided information?'
      answer: |
       'The "username" option within the Apache Camel FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) component is designed for basic authentication purposes. It has no default value (defaultValue: null). Its data type is a string, and its required status is set as false, meaning that it''s not necessary to provide this parameter if left unspecified. Lastly, it belongs to the security group (groups: "security").'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the ''encoding'' option in the Apache Camel FHIR component, and is it required when using this component? Also, can you specify which group this option belongs to within the FHIR component configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The ''encoding'' option in the Apache Camel FHIR component does not have a default value (defaultValue: null) and its data type is string (type: string). It is optional and can be configured if needed, though its use is not required when working with this component (required: false). This option belongs to the ''common'' group within the FHIR component configuration (groups: common).'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the FHIR version option in Apache Camel''s fhir component if a specific value is not provided during configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the FHIR version option in Apache Camel''s fhir component, if no specific value is provided during configuration, is R4.'
    - question: 'How can you set a parameter value within the Apache Camel FHIR component to be passed as the In Body, and what is its default value if it''s not provided?'
      answer: |
       'To pass a parameter value within the Apache Camel FHIR component as the In Body, you can set the component to "fhir" and specify the option as "inBody". The value for this parameter can be configured as a string. It''s important to note that providing a default value for this parameter is optional; if it''s not specified, its default value will be null. Additionally, remember that these settings fall under the common group of options within the FHIR component.'
    - question: 'In relation to the Apache Camel FHIR component, could you explain what happens when the "log" option for the "fhir" component is set to true in a Camel route? And does setting it to true have a default value?'
      answer: |
       'When you set the "log" option for the Apache Camel FHIR component to true within a Camel route, it means that every request and response exchanged between the client (Camel) and the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) server will be logged. This is useful for debugging, as you can track and examine these interactions in more detail during development or troubleshooting stages. It''s important to note that setting this option to true does not have a default value; it must be explicitly set by the user within the Camel route configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the Apache Camel component FHIR''s "prettyPrint" option, and is it required when using this option?'
      answer: |
       'The default value of the "prettyPrint" option for the Apache Camel component FHIR is false. It is a boolean data type, and it is not required to use this option in your setup as it can be toggled according to your preference for request formatting.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it''s required for the Apache Camel FHIr component option named "serverUrl"? Also, can you explain what group this option belongs to?'
      answer: |
       'The option "serverUrl" in the Apache Camel FHIR component is a string-type value that represents the base URL of your FHIR server. Its default value is null, which means it must be provided explicitly if you wish to establish a connection. It''s an optional parameter, so its use isn''t required when setting up the component. The option "serverUrl" belongs to the common group within the configuration settings for this component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel FHIR component''s "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option and when is it recommended to set its value to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option within the Apache Camel FHIR component enables you to send an empty message (without a body) when the polling consumer has not polled any files. This can be beneficial in situations where you want consistent, scheduled updates regardless of whether there are new resources to process at that specific interval. Setting this value to true is recommended if you wish to maintain a regular data flow from your system even during idle periods.'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel FHIR component''s bridgeErrorHandler option function in terms of exception handling when an error occurs during message pickup, and why is it only possible for certain third-party components to use this feature? Also, what is the default behavior when bridgeErrorHandler is not used?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel FHIR component''s `bridgeErrorHandler` option facilitates linking the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, meaning that any exceptions (if supported by the third-party component) occurring while the Camel consumer attempts to pick up incoming messages will now be treated as messages and handled accordingly. However, it is essential to note that this feature is only feasible for those third-party components that permit Camel to be informed if an exception was thrown. Some components manage exceptions internally, which precludes using the `bridgeErrorHandler`. In instances where we can integrate Camel with the 3rd party component to enable this functionality in future releases, we will do so. By default, when the bridgeErrorHandler is not utilized, the consumer relies on the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler` to manage exceptions, which logs them at WARN or ERROR level and ignores them.'
    - question: 'What custom exception handling can be implemented using the Apache Camel FHIR component when working with a consumer, and under what circumstances is it not in use if the bridgeErrorHandler option is enabled? Furthermore, what is the default behavior for exception handling in the absence of a custom ExceptionHandler and how is it configured within the "consumer (advanced)" group?'
      answer: |
       'When working with the Apache Camel FHIR component as a consumer, you can implement a custom ExceptionHandler by manually setting the "exceptionHandler" option in your configuration. However, if the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled, a custom ExceptionHandler will not be in use because the bridge Error Handler will take precedence. By default, exceptions that are logged at the WARN or ERROR level will be handled by the component itself, meaning they will be logged but not thrown further. This behavior can be configured within the "consumer (advanced)" group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component, and is it required or optional in a setup configuration? Additionally, what is the default value for this option and to which group does it belong in terms of usage complexity (basic, intermediate, advanced)?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component defines the interaction pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. This is used to describe how messages will be exchanged between the sender and the receiver. It''s an optional setting in a setup configuration, meaning that it can be included or excluded based on your requirements. The default value for this option is null, indicating that if not specified, the component will use its default behavior. In terms of usage complexity, the "exchangePattern" option falls under the ''advanced'' group as it allows for more complex interaction patterns between the consumer and producer in a Camel routing scenario.'
    - question: 'What is the default value of the `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel FHIR component, and how can a custom implementation be provided to control error handling during the poll operation before an Exchange has been created?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is null. To provide a custom implementation for controlling error handling during the poll operation before an Exchange is created, you can use a pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy. This allows you to offer your own custom solution for managing errors that may occur during the poll operation within Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "lazyStartProducer" option within the Apache Camel component FHIR, and under what circumstances might it be useful to set this option to true? Additionally, are there any potential drawbacks or considerations when using this option in a CamelContext or route configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option within the Apache Camel FHIR component allows you to configure whether the producer should be started lazily (on the first message). This feature can be beneficial when a producer might fail during the initial startup of the CamelContext or routes, preventing them from starting successfully. By setting this option to true and deferring the producer''s startup, you can handle such failures using Camel''s routing error handlers instead.              However, keep in mind that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time, thereby prolonging the overall processing time of the messages. This could impact performance depending on your use case and system requirements.              The default value for this option is false. The "lazyStartProduender" group belongs to advanced FHIR component options, which means it''s intended for users who require more fine-tuning of the FHIR component behavior within their CamelContext or routes.'
    - question: 'What is the method for utilizing a custom client with Apache Camel''s FHIR component, and is it an optional requirement? (Based on the provided information)'
      answer: |
       'The method for utilizing a custom client with Apache Camel''s FHIR component involves using the "client" option. This is an optional step as indicated by its "required": false property in the configuration. If you wish to use a custom client, you can provide the object under this option during the setup of your FHIR route or exchange. This feature falls under the advanced group of options, so it may not be necessary for basic usage.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "clientFactory" option within the Apache Camel Fhir component, and how can we provide a custom client factory for this component if it''s required?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientFactory" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is an advanced feature designed to allow you to use a custom client factory when interacting with FHIR servers. This option becomes useful when you want more control over the client creation process, such as configuring specific settings, authenticating using custom strategies, or using non-standard clients.              To provide a custom client factory for this component, you can set the "clientFactory" property to an object that implements the org.hl7.fhir.rest.client.IRestClientFactory interface in your Camel route configuration. This object will then be responsible for creating the FHIR clients used by the component throughout the Camel exchange. Remember that this option is optional, so you can stick with the default client creation process if it suits your needs.'
    - question: 'In Apache Camel''s FHIR component, is it mandatory or optional to enable compressing the outgoing contents using the GZIP format when making POST/PUT requests?'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s FHIR component, compressing the outgoing (POST/PUT) contents in the GZIP format is an optional feature. By default, this option is disabled, but you can choose to enable it if desired, under the ''advanced'' configuration group.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and maximum range for the Apache Camel FHIR component''s "connectionTimeout" option in milliseconds, and is it a required or optional parameter in the configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the connectionTimeout option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is 10000 milliseconds (or 10 seconds). Regarding its maximum range, as the information provided does not specify it, I''m unable to confirm if there''s a hard limit on the timeout duration. Lastly, it''s an optional parameter in the configuration, meaning you can choose whether to set it or not when configuring your Camel routes with FHIR.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of setting the "deferModelScanning" option to true in the Apache Camel Fhir component, and what is its default value and group classification?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "deferModelScanning" option to true in the Apache Camel FHIr component allows for model classes not to be scanned for their child relationships until they are actually accessed. This can potentially improve performance, especially when dealing with complex models that have numerous inter-dependent classes. It is important to note that this option is set to false by default and belongs to the "advanced" group of configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and best practice for setting the FhirContext option in the Apache Camel Fhir component, and is it optional to do so?'
      answer: |
       'The FhirContext object is expensive to create within the Apache Camel Fhir component. To optimize performance, particularly when dealing with multiple instances, you can set the FhirContext option directly instead of creating a new instance for each usage. While it''s not strictly required, setting the FhirContext option is recommended in advanced scenarios as a best practice to prevent unnecessary resource allocation.'
    - question: '"What is the purpose, default value, type, and group assignment of the ''forceConformanceCheck'' option in the Apache Camel Fhir component, and is it required when using this component?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''forceConformanceCheck'' option in the Apache Camel FHLIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) component is designed to enforce conformance checks. Its default value is set to false.

    - question: 'What are the possible values for the Apache Camel fhir validationMode option, and under what circumstances will it default to ONCE in terms of when the FHIR Server''s conformance statement should be validated?'
      answer: |
       'The `fhir validationMode` option in Apache Camel can take a string value, with the default being "ONCE". This setting determines when the Conformance Statement of the FHIR Server should be validated. By default, it''s set to once, which means that the validation will occur only during the initial setup or when explicitly requested afterwards. This setting falls under advanced configurations and can be toggled off if desired, allowing for flexibility in how your system interacts with FHIR servers based on specific use cases and requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the "proxyHost" option in the Apache Camel Fhir component, and is its usage related to configuring proxies for FHIR requests?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyHost" option in the Apache Camel Fhir component is a configurable string parameter used within the "proxy" group. Its purpose is to provide a host to which proxy connections for FHIR requests should be directed, if needed. The default value for this option is null, meaning that no default proxy host is set when none is provided explicitly. So, yes, its usage is indeed related to configuring proxies for FHIR requests. If you choose to specify a host, the Camel Fhir component will route your requests through that specified proxy.'

    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Fhir component, and why is it not a required setting within the scheduler groups?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component denotes the number of consecutive error polls (when an error occurs during polling) that should transpire before the "backoffMultipler" should initiate. However, it is not a required setting within the scheduler groups as it has a default value of null, meaning no specific integer value is provided by default. This flexibility in the configuration allows users to customize this setting according to their use case and error handling strategy.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Fhir component, if a default value is not specified, and how does it relate to the scheduler group?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is an integer parameter that denotes the number of idle polls (polling without any response) that should occur before the backoffMultiplier comes into play. This value is not specified by default. It plays a role in regulating the retry policy, helping to manage the rate at which retries are attempted after an idle period in FHIR communications within the context of the scheduler group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "backoffMultiplier" option within the Apache Camel FHIR component under the scheduler group, and what is its default value? Also, why are backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold required to be configured when using the backoffMultiplier option?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffMultiplier" option in Apache Camel''s FHIR component, under the scheduler group, is designed to facilitate a backoff mechanism for the scheduled polling consumer. This option allows the system to skip a specified number of polls after a series of idles or errors has occurred before attempting again. The skipped polls are determined by the multiplier value you set.              For instance, if you set the "backoffMultiplier" to 3, the consumer will skip 3 scheduled polls after experiencing consecutive idles or errors and then attempt again.              It''s crucial to note that when using the "backoffMultiplier", options like "backoffIdleThreshold" and/or "backoffErrorThreshold" must also be configured. This is because these thresholds define the number of idles or errors within which the backoff mechanism should apply. In other words, if the number of idles or errors encountered exceeds the corresponding threshold values, then the backoffMultiplier kicks in and skips the required number of polls as specified by the multiplier value. This setup enables the system to gracefully handle temporary connectivity issues or server-side problems while maintaining overall performance and reliability.'
    - question: 'How long is the default delay (in milliseconds) between polling actions when using the ''delay'' option with the ''fhir'' component in Apache Camel''s ''scheduler'' group, and is it mandatory to set this value?'
      answer: |
       'The default delay for polling actions when employing the ''delay'' option with the ''fhir'' component within Apache Camel''s ''scheduler'' group is 500 milliseconds (ms). However, setting this value is optional as it has a default value provided.'
    - question: 'In Apache Camel''s FHIR component, what is the functionality of the "greedy" option within the ScheduledPollConsumer? And when is it enabled by default?'
      answer: |
       'The "greedy" option within the ScheduledPollConsumer of Apache Camel''s FHIR component controls its behavior. If "greedy" is set to true, it means that if the previous run of this consumer polled one or more messages, the consumer will immediately run again. However, this option is disabled by default (i.e., false).'
    - question: 'What is the default value, data type, and whether it''s required for the "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component within the scheduler group, if provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component within the scheduler group has a default value of 1000 milliseconds (ms). It is of integer type and is not required, meaning it can be omitted if you do not wish to specify an initial delay before the first poll starts.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum number of times the FHIR component in Apache Camel will fire if the `repeatCount` option is set to 5 in a scheduler setup?'
      answer: |
       'The FHIR component in Apache Camel, when set up with a `repeatCount` option of 5 within the scheduler, will allow for a maximum of 5 fires. After the fifth firing event, further firing will not occur unless you reset or modify this setting again.'
    - question: 'What is the default logging level for the ''start/complete'' log lines emitted by the Apache Camel FHIR component when polling, and can this default value be overridden if desired?'

If you desire to change this default value, it can indeed be overridden as this option allows you to configure the logging level for that particular event.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel FHIR component''s option called "scheduledExecutorService", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel FHIR component''s option named "scheduledExecutorService" allows for configuring a custom or shared thread pool to be used by the consumer. By default, each consumer uses its own single-threaded thread pool. The use of this option is optional as indicated by the "required: false" in its configuration. There is no default value specified for this option.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel FHIR component''s scheduler option to use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz? Is there a default value for this option and if not, is it required?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel FHIR component''s scheduler option to use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz, you can specify the value as either "spring" or "quartz" for the built-in schedulers. If no specific value is provided for this option, it has no default value. However, using this option is not a requirement and you may choose to leave it out if you don''t need a scheduler in your application.'
    - question: 'How can I configure additional properties when using a custom scheduler with Apache Camel''s FHIR component, and what properties are available for this configuration if I decide to do so?'
      answer: |
       'When utilizing a custom scheduler in conjunction with Apache Camel''s FHIR component, you can configure additional properties by setting values for the "schedulerProperties" object. This option is applicable not only for your custom scheduler but also for the Quartz or Spring-based schedulers. The "schedulerProperties" accepts an object as its value, which means you can specify multiple properties within this object should you choose to do so. However, it''s important to note that the default value for these properties is null, and their usage isn''t required. These properties belong to the scheduler group, suggesting they are designed specifically to work with the scheduling functionality of Apache Camel''s FHIR component.'
    - question: 'How do you configure the Apache Camel FHIR component''s `startScheduler` option to disable the automatic starting of the scheduler when using it?'
      answer: |
       'To disable the automatic starting of the scheduler for the Apache Camel FHIR component, set the `startScheduler` option to false in your configuration. As the provided information suggests, this boolean value is initially set to true by default but can be configured otherwise. Here''s a sample code snippet:              ```json       {         "component": "fhir",         "startScheduler": false,         ...other configurations...       }       ```              This modification ensures that the scheduler will not start automatically when you utilize the Apache Camel FHIR component.'
