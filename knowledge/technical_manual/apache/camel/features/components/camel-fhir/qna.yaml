    - question: 'What is the default value and data type, and is it mandatory for the Apache Camel fhir component''s encoding option to be specified when using it?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel FHIR component''s encoding option is null. It is of data type string and not mandatory for specification as it can be skipped if no specific encoding preference is required, under the common group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the Apache Camel component ''fhir'' option named ''fhirVersion'', and is it required when using this option?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the FHIR version in the Apache Camel fhir component is "R4", and its data type is a string. Using this option is not mandatory, as indicated by the "required: false" property.'
    - question: 'How do you configure the Apache Camel FHIR component to log every request and response? (Given that the default value is false and it''s an optional boolean setting, does this configuration require any specific setting or can it be enabled/disabled at runtime?)'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel FHIR component to log every request and response, you need to set the "log" option to true in your route configuration. Since the default value is false, if you want to enable logging, you should explicitly set it as follows:              ```       from("fhir://your-fhir-server")         .log(LoggingLevel.DEBUG, true) // Enable logging of requests and responses         ...       ;       ```              This setting can be enabled or disabled at runtime as it is an optional boolean configuration. You can modify the value of the log option based on your requirements in your route''s configuration while Camel is running.'
    - question: 'What is the default value of the "prettyPrint" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component and can it be set to true or false if not required?'
      answer: |
       'The default value of the "prettyPrint" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is false. However, it can be set to true or false if not required.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it''s required for the Apache Camel component "fhir" option named "serverUrl"?'
      answer: |
       'The "serverUrl" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is a string field that represents the base URL of the FHIR server. It has no default value, meaning you must provide it explicitly during configuration. This option is not mandatory, so its use is optional within your integration scenarios. The group it belongs to is "common".'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel FHIR component''s bridgeErrorHandler option function, and when might it be beneficial to set it to true in a Camel route configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel FHIR component''s `bridgeErrorHandler` option enables bridging errors that occur within the Camel consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions, if the underlying 3rd party component allows it, will be treated as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler. Setting this option to true can be beneficial when you want a more robust error handling mechanism for your Camel route, especially when dealing with components that allow Camel to be alerted upon an exception being thrown. However, not all 3rd party components support this feature, as some handle exceptions internally only. In such cases, the consumer will default to using the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler` for error handling, logging errors at WARN or ERROR level and ignoring them.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component affect the behavior of a Camel route, specifically regarding the startup and handling of potential producer failures during the initializing phase of the route?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component allows for a more resilient startup behavior of your Camel route. Instead of initiating the producer immediately upon context start, it will be started only upon encountering the first message. This deferred initialization can help handle situations where the producer might otherwise fail during startup and cause the entire route to fail.              In cases where the producer could potentially lead to startup failures, having a lazy start allows the CamelContext and routes to initialize without issue. Any subsequent production failure can then be managed through Camel''s built-in routing error handlers. Keep in mind that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time, thus prolonging the total processing time of the route.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and when is it appropriate to disable the ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel FHIR component, and are there any specific groups of users for whom this option may be particularly relevant in its advanced functionality?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is set to true, meaning autowiring is enabled by default. This feature allows automatic configuration of various resources such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, and more, by looking up in the registry for a single instance of a matching type.              However, it may be appropriate to disable this option when you want explicit control over the creation and configuration of instances rather than relying on autowiring. This option is particularly relevant for advanced users who require fine-grained control over resource configurations, such as those dealing with complex or highly customized integration scenarios. The ''autowiredEnabled'' option falls under the ''advanced'' group of options in the FHIR component.'
    - question: 'What configuration is required to utilize a custom client in the Apache Camel FHIR component?'
      answer: |
       'To utilize a custom client in the Apache Camel FHIR component, you need to configure it using an object of type "custom client". This configuration is optional and falls under the advanced group. No default value is provided for this configuration, so you''ll need to supply your own custom client instance when setting it up.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "clientFactory" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component, and does it have a default value or is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientFactory" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component serves to allow you to use a custom client factory. This means that instead of using the default client provided by FHIR, you can create your own instance of the client with specific configurations or implementations. Whether it has a default value or is required depends on the context of your integration; by default, if no custom client factory is provided, the component will utilize the default FHIR client. This option is considered "advanced", indicating that it might not be necessary for basic use-cases but can be utilized for more complex scenarios requiring specific client configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "compress" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component and is it mandatory to set this option when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "compress" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is false, meaning outgoing content will not be compressed by default. However, setting this option to true can enable GZIP compression for your POST/PUT requests, which may improve performance or reduce bandwidth usage if needed. You are not required to set this option when using the component as it belongs to the advanced group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the method or way to utilize a shared configuration in the Apache Camel FHIR component, and is it optional (has a default value of null)?'
      answer: |
       'To utilize a shared configuration in the Apache Camel FHIR component, you can make use of an object-type configuration option labeled as "configuration". This option is not mandatory, meaning it has a default value of null. However, to access a shared setup, you should provide this configuration when setting up your FHIR component. Keep in mind that the usage of this feature falls under the advanced settings group.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the connectionTimeout option in the Apache Camel FHIR component, and is it mandatory for configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "connectionTimeout" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is an integer type variable with a default value of 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds). It is not mandatory for configuration as it falls under the "advanced" group, which means it can be optionally configured to determine how long to attempt establishing the initial TCP connection.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "deferModelScanning" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component, and can it be considered as an optional configuration setting?'
      answer: |
       'The "deferModelScanning" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is designed to control when model classes are scanned for children. When set to true, the model classes will not be scanned until the child list for a given type is explicitly accessed. This can help performance by avoiding unnecessary initialization. By default, the "deferModelScanning" option is false, meaning model classes are scanned immediately. It''s an optional configuration setting, categorized under advanced options in the FHIR component.'
    - question: 'What is the recommended practice for managing instance creation of FhirContext in Apache Camel''s fhir component to optimize performance and prevent unnecessary object creation?'
      answer: |
       'To optimize performance and prevent unnecessary object creation when using Apache Camel''s fhir component, it is recommended to set the FhirContext instance directly instead of creating multiple instances. This approach can help reduce the expense associated with object creation.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it is required for the "forceConformanceCheck" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component, and which group does it belong to under advanced settings?'
      answer: |
       'The "forceConformanceCheck" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is designed to force a conformance check. By default, it is set to false. Its data type is boolean, meaning it can only have two values: true or false. It is not required for use, and can be found under the advanced settings group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, requirement status (optional or required), and group association of the Apache Camel Fhir component''s "sessionCookie" option?'
      answer: |
       'The purpose of the Apache Camel FHIR component''s "sessionCookie" option is to provide an HTTP session cookie that gets added to every request. The default value for this option is null. Its data type is string. Whether it is required or optional depends on the specific configuration; it can be set as optional since a default value is provided. This option belongs to the advanced group of settings within the Apache Camel FHIR component.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the Apache Camel FHIR component''s socketTimeout option, and can it be configured as a required parameter? (Answer: The default value is 10000 milliseconds, it is an integer, and it can be configured as an optional parameter.)'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel FHIR component''s socketTimeout option is an integer with a default value of 10000 milliseconds (or 10 seconds). It can be configured as an optional parameter, meaning you don''t have to provide it in every usage scenario. This option determines how long to block for individual read/write operations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of setting the "summary" option to true when using the Apache Camel FHIR component and what is its default value, if it has one? Also, is the use of this option considered mandatory or optional in the given configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "summary" option, when set to true in the Apache Camel FHIR component, instructs the server to modify the response using the _summary parameter. This option is used for more advanced configurations and does not have a default value. Its use is considered optional in the given configuration.'
    - question: 'What are the possible values for the Apache Camel component fhir''s validationMode option, and what does it configure regarding the validation of a FHIR server''s conformance statement?'
      answer: |
       'The "validationMode" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component can have the value "ONCE". This configuration determines when Camel validates the FHIR Server''s conformance statement. By default, it is set to "ONCE", which means that Camel will validate the server''s conformance statement only once during its interaction with the server. This option is considered advanced, and its use is optional.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "proxyHost" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component, and is it required or optional? Also, where can this option be found within the component''s configuration settings?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyHost" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is a configurable parameter used for setting a proxy host. This means if your system needs to make requests through a proxy server, you can specify the host of that proxy here. By default, it has no preset value ("defaultValue": null). Its usage is optional as indicated by "required": false. You can find this option within the "proxy" group of configuration settings for the FHIR component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it''s required for the `proxyPassword` option within the Apache Camel FHIR component, and in which group does this option belong?'
      answer: |
       'The `proxyPassword` option within the Apache Camel FHIR component is a string data type that provides a way to set the password for proxy authentication. Its default value is null, meaning it''s not automatically filled if not explicitly provided. Whether it''s required or not depends on the specific usage scenario as it has been marked as optional (required: false). This option belongs to the ''proxy'' group of settings within the FHIR component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it is required to configure the proxyPort option in the Apache Camel FHIR component when setting up a proxy?'
      answer: |
       'The `proxyPort` option in the Apache Camel FHIR component serves as the port for the proxy server if one is being used. Its default value is null, meaning you need to specify it during configuration. Although not mandatory (as indicated by "required": false), setting the `proxyPort` can be useful when your setup involves a proxy server. This option falls under the "proxy" groups in the FHIR component''s settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "proxyUser" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyUser" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is an optional string field. Its purpose is to specify a proxy username for authentication when interacting with FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) servers. By default, it has no value, meaning that if not provided, the underlying environment or configuration will be used for authentication.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it is required for the `accessToken` option in the Apache Camel FHIR component, under the security group?'
      answer: |
       'The `accessToken` option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is an OAuth access token, with a default value of null. It has a data type of string and is not required. This option falls under the security group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, required status, and group affiliation of the "password" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component for basic authentication?'
      answer: |
       'The "password" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component serves the purpose of providing a password for basic authentication. Its default value is null, meaning no pre-set password is provided. The data type of this option is string. The "required" status is false, indicating that it''s optional to provide a password. Lastly, this option falls under the security group of settings in the component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it''s required or not for the Apache Camel component fhir option named "username" in terms of basic authentication?'
      answer: |
       'The purpose of the "username" option within the Apache Camel FHIR component is to provide a string value for basic authentication during interactions. By default, this field does not have a value assigned ("defaultValue": null). Its data type is a string ("type":"string"). Using this option for authentication is optional as it''s marked as "required": false. This setting falls under the security group of options ("groups":"security").'
    - question: 'What is the default encoding value and is it mandatory in Apache Camel FHIR component when using the ''encoding'' option within a request? (Hint: The default value is null, and the encoding option is not required.)'
      answer: |
       'The default encoding value for Apache Camel FHIR component when using the ''encoding'' option within a request is null, and it is not mandatory.'
    - question: 'What is the default FHIR version used when the Apache Camel component "fhir" is utilized, and is it possible to specify a different FHIR version if desired?'
      answer: |
       'The default FHIR version utilized when using the Apache Camel component "fhir" is R4. However, it''s possible to specify a different FHIR version if desired, as the option for FHIR Version (fhirVersion) is not required.'
    - question: 'How do you specify a parameter to be passed as the In Body using the ''inBody'' option within the Apache Camel Fhir component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'To pass a parameter in the exchange In Body using the ''inBody'' option within the Apache Camel Fhir component, you can set the name of the parameter as described with the "component": "fhir" and "option": "inBody". This option is not mandatory to use, as indicated by the "required": false. Therefore, it is optional to include this parameter in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for enabling logging of both requests and responses in Apache Camel''s FHIR component, and is it necessary to explicitly set this option if the user does not want logging? (From the given information, it appears that logging is optional since the "required" field is set to false.)'
      answer: |
       'The default value for enabling logging of requests and responses in Apache Camel''s FHIR component is false. Since logging is optional, it is not necessary to explicitly set this option if the user does not want logging.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, type, and whether it is required for the Apache Camel FHIR component''s "prettyPrint" option, and in which group can this option be found?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel FHIR component''s "prettyPrint" option is a boolean setting that determines if all requests should be pretty-printed for easier reading. Its default value is false, meaning pretty printing is turned off by default. This option can be set to true if desired. It is not required to use this option, making it an optional configuration. The "prettyPrint" option can be found in the common group of settings within the FHIR component''s configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value (if any), data type, and requirement status of the Apache Camel component fhir option named ''serverUrl''?'
      answer: |
       'The FHIR server base URL (''serverUrl'') is an optional (''required'': false) string-type configuration within the Apache Camel component ''fhir''. It specifies the URL where your Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) server can be found. By default, it has no predefined value (''defaultValue'': null). This option falls under the common group of settings (''groups'': ''common'').'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component when it comes to sending messages if the polling consumer did not poll any files, and if this option can be enabled to send an empty message (no body) instead? Also, what type of value does this option take, and is its usage optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is that it will not send any message if the polling consumer did not poll any files. However, you can enable this option to change this behavior and have the component send an empty message (no body) instead. This option takes a boolean value and its usage is optional, not required.'
    - question: 'How does the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel FHIR component function, and under what conditions is it possible for this feature to be utilized effectively?'
      answer: |
       'The `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel FHIR component serves to link the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions (if supported by the third-party component) that occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to retrieve incoming messages can now be treated as messages and managed by the routing Error Handler.              However, it''s important to note that this feature can only be effectively utilized when the third-party component allows Camel to be notified if an exception was thrown. Some components may handle exceptions internally, in which case `bridgeErrorHandler` is not applicable. In situations where we can integrate Camel with the third-party component, this feature may be improved for future releases to make it more widely applicable.              By default, when `bridgeErrorHandler` is not enabled, the consumer will use the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler` to manage exceptions, which will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and then disregarded.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel FHIR component''s exceptionHandler option when working in a consumer role, and how can a custom ExceptionHandler be utilized with this option? Additionally, explain the relationship between the exceptionHandler and the bridgeErrorHandler options, and provide information about their default values.'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel FHIR component''s exceptionHandler option serves to allow you, as a consumer, to use a custom ExceptionHandler within your setup. When the bridgeErrorHandler is not enabled, this option becomes functional. By default, the consumer will manage exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.              If you wish to utilize a custom ExceptionHandler with this option, you can do so by providing an appropriate implementation object when configuring your FHIR component.              It''s important to note that if bridgeErrorHandler is activated, the exceptionHandler option will not be in use. The bridgeErrorHandler option handles exceptions and transforms them into FHIR Response or Error responses, depending on the severity of the error.              Both exceptionHandler and bridgeErrorHandler options are advanced features found under the consumer group in Camel FHIR component''s configuration. By default, neither of these options have a value assigned to them.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component for a scenario where the consumer is creating an exchange, and is this option considered as a required or optional configuration parameter?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel FHIR component, the "exchangePattern" option sets the pattern of exchange when the consumer initiates an exchange. By default, it has no value assigned. This option is used to configure how data is exchanged between components in your Camel route. It''s considered as an optional configuration parameter and falls under the advanced group of settings called "consumer (advanced)".'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel FHIR component, and what is its purpose when providing a custom implementation? How can this option be configured during the setup of a Camel consumer, and under which group of options does it belong?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is null. This option allows you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually encountered during the poll operation before an Exchange has been created and routed in Camel. You can configure this option during the setup of a Camel consumer, and it belongs to the "consumer (advanced)" group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component, and under what circumstances might it be useful to enable this feature?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option within the Apache Camel FHIR component allows you to configure whether the producer should start lazily (on the first message). This attribute can be beneficial in scenarios where a producer may fail during initial startup, potentially causing the entire route to fail. By opting for lazy startup, you enable the failure to be managed through Camel''s routing error handlers instead of preventing the route from starting up.              However, it''s important to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time, thus slightly prolonging the overall processing duration. The default value for this option is false, meaning the producer will start immediately upon route startup.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and configuration (if any) of using a custom client in the Apache Camel FHIR component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The purpose of using a custom client in the Apache Camel FHIR component is to provide advanced users with the flexibility to create and manage their own FHIR clients instead of using the default one provided by Camel-FHIR. This option, identified as "client" within the component''s configuration, is optional and can be configured at your discretion if you prefer a specific client implementation for your use case. It belongs to the "advanced" groups in the component''s configuration options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "clientFactory" option in the Apache Camel Fhir component, and is it optional or required when using this component? Furthermore, can you provide an example of how to customize a client factory for the Fhir component?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientFactory" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is an advanced feature that allows you to use a custom client factory instead of the default one. This option is not mandatory, as it''s set to optional with a default value of null. When you want more control over the client creation process, such as using a specific client version or configuring custom client settings, you can provide your own client factory implementation.              Here''s an example of how to customize a client factory for the FHIR component:              In your Camel route, create a bean (or use an existing one) for the client factory that extends the base FHIR client factory class and overrides the methods as needed:              ```java       @Bean       public FhirClientFactory myCustomFhirClientFactory() {           return new FhirClientFactory() {               @Override               protected FhirClient createClient(RestClient restClient) {                   // Your custom client creation logic here, e.g., using a specific client version or configuration                   return super.createClient(restClient);               }           };       }       ```              Then, refer to your custom client factory bean in the FHIR component settings:              ```java       from("direct:start")           .toFhir("fhir://localhost:8043?clientFactory=#myCustomFhirClientFactory");       ```              By doing this, you are using your custom client factory for creating the FHIR clients in your Camel route.'
    - question: 'How can I configure Apache Camel FHIR component to compress the outgoing data using the GZIP format in case I want to enable this advanced feature?'
      answer: |
       'To configure Apache Camel FHIR component to compress the outgoing data using the GZIP format, you need to set the "compress" option to true under the "advanced" group. Here''s how you can do it:              Add the following configuration to your route:              ```xml       from("direct:your-fhir-endpoint")       .to("fhir:rest://your-server/FHIR-resource?compress=true");       ```              If the "compress" option is not set explicitly, it will use its default value (false) and GZIP compression will not be applied to your outgoing data.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the Apache Camel FHIR component''s option "connectionTimeout" in milliseconds, and is it mandatory to set this option when using the FHIR component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel FHIR component''s option "connectionTimeout" is 10000 milliseconds (or 10 seconds). It is not mandatory to set this option when using the FHIR component, as it falls under the "advanced" group and can be customized if desired.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "deferModelScanning" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component, and how does it behave when its default value is set?'
      answer: |
       'The "deferModelScanning" option in the Apache Camel FHIR component is designed to control model class scanning behavior. When this option is set, the model classes will not be scanned for children until the child list for the given type is explicitly accessed. This can help improve performance by reducing unnecessary initializations. By default, this option is false, meaning model classes are scanned immediately upon component initialization. However, when its default value is set, it allows for a more efficient approach where the scanning only occurs when necessary, under specific conditions. This feature falls under the advanced group of configuration options.'
    - question: 'What is the recommended approach for managing the FhirContext instance in Apache Camel''s fhir component to minimize its creation and potential memory overhead?'
      answer: |
       'To optimize the usage of the FhirContext instance in Apache Camel''s fhir component, it is recommended to directly set the FhirContext object instead of creating multiple instances. This approach can help minimize the expense associated with object creation and potentially reduce memory overhead. However, this feature is considered advanced, so ensure you are familiar with its use before implementing it in your projects.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, optional nature, and group association of the Apache Camel FHIR component option named "forceConformanceCheck"?'
      answer: |
       'The "forceConformanceCheck" option for the Apache Camel FHIR component is designed to force a conformance check. It defaults to false, meaning the conformance check is not automatically run. This option is of boolean data type and can be omitted if not specified explicitly, as it falls under the advanced group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, required status, and group affiliation of the Apache Camel FHIR component option named "sessionCookie"? Additionally, how can this option be configured if not using its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel FHIR component''s "sessionCookie" option is an HTTP session cookie to add to every request. By default, it doesn''t have a value (defaultValue: null). It''s an optional configuration (required: false) found under the advanced group of options (groups: "advanced"). If you wish to use a value other than its default, you can configure it by providing a string value for this option. For instance, if you want to set the session cookie as "mySessionCookie", you would do so in your Camel configuration like so:              `from("direct:start") .to("fhir://my-server?sessionCookie=mySessionCookie");`              This will cause the specified cookie to be added to every request made by this route.'
