    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Google Secret Manager component affect the behavior of a Camel route during startup, and what are the potential trade-offs associated with this feature?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Google Secret Manager component allows for delayed initialization of the producer during route execution. This can be beneficial in scenarios where the producer may initially fail during startup, preventing the entire route from being initiated. By deferring the producer''s startup, you can handle these failures using Camel''s routing error handlers.              However, it''s important to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time, thereby prolonging the total processing duration of the route. This trade-off exists because while lazy startup ensures a more robust initial CamelContext and route setup, it potentially introduces a slight delay in the production of the output during the initial message processing stage.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel Google Secret Manager component, and can it be required or disabled if needed?'
      answer: |
       'The ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel Google Secret Manager component is a boolean setting used for enabling automatic autowiring of options. By default, this option is set to true. It facilitates the automatic configuration of components like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, and more, by searching the registry for a single instance of matching type.              If needed, the ''autowiredEnabled'' option can be disabled by setting it to false, or it can remain optional as it is marked as required=false in the configuration. This flexibility allows you to control how your components are configured based on your application''s specific needs.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and type of the "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel Google Secret Manager component, and is it required or optional? Also, does this option have a default value specified?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel Google Secret Manager component is a string type that provides a service account key for authenticating an application as a service account. This option is optional, meaning it doesn''t need to be provided every time if you have already set up authentication with another method. It does not have a default value specified.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "operation" option within the Apache Camel component "google-secret-manager" for a producer configuration, if it is not required?'
      answer: |
       'The "operation" option in the Apache Camel component "google-secret-manager" for a producer configuration serves to specify the operation to be performed on the Secret Manager Producer. However, this option is optional, meaning it is not always necessary to provide it. By default, if no operation is provided, its value will be null.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and usage of the "pojoRequest" option in the Apache Camel Google Secret Manager component, and is it required when using this component for producer configurations?'
      answer: |
       'The "pojoRequest" option in the Apache Camel Google Secret Manager component has a default value of false. This option specifies if the request being made to the Google Secret Manager is a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) request. If set to true, you would be sending a POJO as your request body instead of using the standard key-value approach. Although it''s not required, setting this option can be useful for certain custom use cases depending on your producer configurations within the Google Secret Manager component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component "google-secret-manager", and under what circumstances might it be beneficial to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option within the Apache Camel component "google-secret-manager" allows you to defer the startup of the producer until the first message is processed. This can be beneficial when a producer might otherwise fail during the initial startup, preventing the route from being started successfully. By starting the producer lazily, any failure during startup can be managed by Camel''s routing error handlers instead. However, be aware that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time, potentially increasing the overall processing time for the task. This option falls under the "producer (advanced)" group in the component settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "client" option in the Apache Camel component "google-secret-manager", and is it a required configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "client" option within the Apache Camel component "google-secret-manager" serves the purpose of specifying the client to be utilized during service invocation. By default, this option has no preset value ("defaultValue": null). Additionally, it''s important to note that using the "client" option is not a required configuration, as indicated by the "required": false property. It falls under advanced configurations grouped under "groups":"advanced".'
