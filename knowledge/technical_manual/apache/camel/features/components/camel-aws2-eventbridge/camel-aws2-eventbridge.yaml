    - question: 'What are the available configuration options, if any, for using the aws2-eventbridge producer component in Apache Camel?'
      answer: |
       'The AWS2-EventBridge producer component in Apache Camel does not have a default configuration. However, it supports an "options" field, specifically a JSON object type named "configuration." This allows you to customize the behavior of the component when using the AWS EventBridge service for event production. The usage and structure of this configuration are dependent on your specific use case with AWS EventBridge and may not be required in every instance, as indicated by the "required" field being set to false. These configuration options can be found in the "groups" section labeled as "producer."'
    - question: '"Can you explain the purpose and properties of the ''eventPatternFile'' option in the Apache Camel aws2-eventbridge component, especially in relation to its default value, required status, data type, group association, and whether it is necessary when using the producer?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''eventPatternFile'' option in the Apache Camel AWS2-EventBridge component is a user-defined setting that specifies a file containing an event pattern for EventBridge events. This option is optional, meaning it is not required to set it when using the producer.              The data type of this property is ''string'', indicating that it accepts a string value as its input. However, it has no default value by default; you must explicitly provide one if you decide to use it.              In terms of group association, the ''eventPatternFile'' option belongs to the ''producer'' group. This suggests that this configuration is typically used when setting up EventBridge event producers rather than consumers or other types of Camel components.              When using the producer with ''eventPatternFile'' set, you should provide a path to the file containing your desired event pattern for filtering events that will be sent to AWS EventBridge. This allows you to control precisely which types of events are generated by your Camel route and eventually forwarded to EventBridge.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "lazyStartProducer" option within the Apache Camel AWS2-EventBridge component, and under what circumstances could it be beneficial to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option within the Apache Camel AWS2-EventBridge component is designed to control whether the producer should be started immediately upon context initiation or deferred until the first message is processed. By setting this option to true, you allow the CamelContext and routes to startup in scenarios where a producer may initially fail during initialization and cause the route failure.              In such instances, deferring the production startup using the ''lazyStartProducer'' allows handling of the initial failure during message routing via Camel''s error handlers. It is essential to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time, thus prolonging the overall processing duration. The default value for this option is false. It can be beneficial to set "lazyStartProducer" to true when you expect potential initial failures with a producer but want your Camel routes to still bootstrap properly without halting the entire system initialization process.'
    - question: 'What is the default operation used by the Apache Camel aws2-eventbridge component when producing events, as specified in its configuration options?'
      answer: |
       'The default operation used by the Apache Camel aws2-eventbridge component when producing events, as specified in its configuration options, is ''putRule''.'
    - question: '"In what scenarios should the Apache Camel aws2-eventbridge ''overrideEndpoint'' option be set to true, and how does it work alongside the ''uriEndpointOverride'' option?"'
      answer: |
       'The "overrideEndpoint" option in the AWS EventBridge component of Apache Camel should be set to true when you want to explicitly override the default endpoint for sending events. This scenario might occur if you need to send events to a different region or an alternate endpoint that deviates from the standard one provided by AWS. It''s important to note that the "overrideEndpoint" option needs to be used in conjunction with the "uriEndpointOverride" option, which allows you to specify the custom URI for your overridden endpoint. When both options are used together, the specified URI will take precedence over the default endpoint. However, if either of these options is not provided or set to their default values (false for "overrideEndpoint" and no value for "uriEndpointOverride"), Camel will use the standard AWS EventBridge endpoint for sending events.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and requirement of using a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) request as the body when configuring the ''pojoRequest'' option in the ''aws2-eventbridge'' component for a Camel producer? (Assuming the information provided.)'
      answer: |
       'The default value for using a POJO request as the body when configuring the ''pojoRequest'' option in the ''aws2-eventbridge'' component for a Camel producer is false. This means that by default, a POJO request will not be used as the body. However, it''s important to note that this option is not required.'
    - question: 'What is the format and purpose of the "region" option when configuring the Apache Camel aws2-eventbridge component, and is it required or optional? Also, what is an example of a valid region name for this configuration when using Java code?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of configuring the AWS Eventbridge component in Apache Camel (aws2-eventbridge), the "region" option specifies the AWS Region where the Eventbridge client should operate. The format requires the lowercase name of the region, for instance, `ap-east-1`. It''s important to note that you should use the Java method `Region.EU_WEST_1.id()` to obtain a valid region name. While the "region" option is not mandatory (i.e., set as optional), it allows flexibility for using Eventbridge clients in different AWS Regions, depending on your application''s needs.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the ''uriEndpointOverride'' option in the Apache Camel component ''aws2-eventbridge'', when should it be combined with which other option, and what type of data can this option accept?'
      answer: |
       'The ''uriEndpointOverride'' option in the Apache Camel AWS2-EventBridge component allows you to specify a custom URI endpoint for the Event Bridge event source. This setting should be utilized alongside the ''overrideEndpoint'' option, as it helps customize the endpoint when needed. It accepts string data, however, it is not a required field. The ''producer'' group of configurations pertains to this option in the context of producing events to AWS Event Bridge.'
    - question: 'Here''s a question that can be answered with the provided information:              "What is the purpose of the ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel aws2-eventbridge component and what is its default value? Is it a required option, and can it be found within which groups of options?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Eventbridge component serves to enable or disable autowiring for automatic configuration purposes. Specifically, if set to true (which is its default value), it allows for the automatic discovery of a single instance of a matching type in the registry, effectively configuring that instance on the component for use cases such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, and so forth. It is not a required option and can be found under the advanced group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `eventbridgeClient` option in the Apache Camel aws2-eventbridge component, and can it be used without configuration when set to its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The `eventbridgeClient` option in the AWS2-Eventbridge component for Apache Camel is an object that allows you to utilize an existing configured AWS Eventbridge client. However, it''s essential to note that when the `eventbridgeClient` option is not explicitly configured or set to its default value (null), it doesn''t mean that the client can be automatically utilized without configuration. The `eventbridgeClient` should be configured appropriately beforehand, as per your specific AWS setup requirements.'
    - question: 'Here''s a question that could be asked regarding the `aws2-eventbridge` Apache Camel component''s option `healthCheckConsumerEnabled`:              "What is the default behavior and purpose of the `healthCheckConsumerEnabled` option in the Apache Camel AWS2-EventBridge component, and under what circumstances can it be disabled?"'
      answer: |
       'The `healthCheckConsumerEnabled` option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Eventbridge component is designed for controlling whether consumer-based health checks are activated from this specific component. By default, this setting is enabled (true), meaning that consumer-based health checks are actively used. You can disable it (false) under circumstances where you wish to prevent all consumer-based health checks from running. This option falls under the "health" group, indicating its role in monitoring and maintaining the overall wellbeing of your AWS2-Eventbridge setup.'
    - question: 'How does one configure the option `healthCheckProducerEnabled` in the Apache Camel AWS2-Eventbridge component, and what is its default value if not explicitly set? Furthermore, where do health checks fit within the context of this component''s group settings?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel AWS2-Eventbridge component, you can configure the `healthCheckProducerEnabled` option to enable or disable all producer-based health checks from this component. By default, this option is set to true, meaning that all producer health checks are enabled. You can override this default behavior globally by setting `camel.health.producersEnabled=false`.              Health checks in the context of this component''s group settings fall under the ''health'' group. This means they are concerned with monitoring and maintaining the health status of your components. When you enable producer-based health checks, it allows Camel to verify that messages are being successfully produced by these components and report their status accordingly.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "proxyHost" option in the Apache Camel component named "aws2-eventbridge", and is it required or optional to use this setting?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyHost" option in the AWS EventBridge component (apache-camel''s aws2-eventbridge) is an optional setting used to define a proxy host when instantiating the Eventbridge client. By default, it has no value. This means that if you choose to use it, you must provide a string with the proxy host address. The group to which this option belongs is "proxy", indicating its relation to proxy configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "proxyPort" option in the Apache Camel component named ''aws2-eventbridge'', and does it have a default value or is its use optional (and if so, to which group of configuration options does it belong)?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyPort" option in the Apache Camel component named ''aws2-eventbridge'' serves the purpose of defining a proxy port when instantiating the Eventbridge client. Its use is optional as indicated by the property "required": false. If used, it accepts an integer value. This option falls under the "proxy" group of configuration options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "proxyProtocol" option when using the Apache Camel component "aws2-eventbridge", and is its use optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyProtocol" option in the AWS2 Eventbridge component within Apache Camel is intended to define a proxy protocol when creating the Eventbridge client. Its default value is HTTPS, meaning if no specific proxy protocol is provided, the client will communicate using HTTPS. It''s worth noting that the use of this option is optional rather than required, as indicated by "required: false". The group where it belongs is labeled as "proxy", suggesting its purpose in relation to proxying configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and required status of the option "accessKey" in the Apache Camel component named ''aws2-eventbridge''? Furthermore, which group does it belong to under its associated security category?'
      answer: |
       'The option "accessKey" within the Apache Camel component ''aws2-eventbridge'' is intended for providing your Amazon AWS Access Key. Its default value is null, meaning you need to specify it manually as it''s not set by default. The data type of this option is string. Regarding its required status, it''s marked as optional, so it can be left empty if not provided. Lastly, this option belongs to the "security" group under its associated security category.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the option `profileCredentialsName` in the Apache Camel AWS2-EventBridge component and is it required, optional or has a default value?'
      answer: |
       'The option `profileCredentialsName` in the Apache Camel AWS2-EventBridge component is intended for use when you are working with a profile credentials provider. This parameter allows you to specify the name of the profile you wish to use. If no value is provided, there''s no default value assigned. Instead, you can choose to set it yourself, making it an optional parameter within the "security" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and group under which the optional configuration option ''secretKey'' can be found in the Apache Camel aws2-eventbridge component, if it is related to Amazon AWS Secret Key?'
      answer: |
       'The ''secretKey'' option in the Apache Camel aws2-eventbridge component serves as an optional configuration for providing your Amazon AWS Secret Key. Its default value is null. This data type is defined as a string. It belongs to the ''security'' group of configurations, suggesting its usage is related to secure access and management of AWS services.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and if it''s required in using the sessionToken option of the aws2-eventbridge component in Apache Camel when assuming an IAM role for security purposes?'
      answer: |
       'The "sessionToken" option within the AWS2-EventBridge component in Apache Camel is a string data type that represents an Amazon AWS Session Token. This token is utilized when a user requires to assume an IAM role. However, it does not have a default value; therefore, you''ll need to provide this token explicitly in your code for the correct functioning of the AWS2-EventBridge component in security contexts related to IAM roles.'
    - question: 'Here is a potential question that can be answered using the provided information about the Apache Camel component `aws2-eventbridge` and its option `trustAllCertificates`:              "What is the purpose of the ''trustAllCertificates'' option in the Apache Camel component ''aws2-eventbridge'', and is this setting required or optional?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''trustAllCertificates'' option in the Apache Camel component ''aws2-eventbridge'' is designed to override certificate validation when you want to trust all certificates presented during SSL/TLS communication. This setting is optional, meaning it can be configured or left unconfigured based on your security needs. When set to true, it falls under the ''security'' category of configuration options in this component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-EventBridge component, and what is its default value and possible data types? Also, is it a mandatory configuration setting to use this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-EventBridge component determines whether the Eventbridge client should automatically load credentials or receive static credentials as input. Its default value is false, indicating that it does not load credentials by default through a provider. This option expects boolean values, and while it''s not mandatory to configure it, it falls under the security group of settings in the context of component configuration.'
    - question: '"What is the default value and purpose of the ''useProfileCredentialsProvider'' option in the Apache Camel component ''aws2-eventbridge'', and when is it optional to use this setting?"'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the ''useProfileCredentialsProvider'' option in the AWS EventBridge component of Apache Camel (aws2-eventbridge) is `false`. This option determines whether the EventBridge client should expect to load credentials through a profile credentials provider. This setting is useful when you want to use AWS credentials that are already configured in an AWS SDK default profile instead of hardcoding the credentials in your application. While it''s not required, it falls under the security group, making it an optional configuration for those who prefer to manage their AWS credentials using a profile.'
    - question: '"What is the purpose and default value of the ''useSessionCredentials'' option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Eventbridge component, and is it mandatory to use this option?" (Answer: It is used for setting whether the Eventbridge client should expect to use Session Credentials, with a default value of false, and its usage is optional.)'
      answer: |
       'The ''useSessionCredentials'' option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Eventbridge component determines whether the Eventbridge client should anticipate using Session Credentials during operations. This feature becomes crucial when a user needs to assume an IAM role within Eventbridge. The default value of this boolean setting is false, meaning that it does not initially expect Session Credentials to be used. Importantly, using Session Credentials through this option is optional.'
    - question: '"Can you explain what the ''eventPatternFile'' option in the Apache Camel AWS2-EventBridge component is used for, its default value, whether it is required, and its relevance to producer group?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''eventPatternFile'' option in the Apache Camel AWS2-EventBridge component is a configuration that allows you to specify an external file containing the Event Pattern for filtering incoming events from Amazon EventBridge. Its default value is null, meaning no file is provided by default. This option is not mandatory as it can be omitted if the desired event pattern is hardcoded into the component directly. The ''eventPatternFile'' option is relevant to the ''producer'' group because it deals with event production in the context of AWS EventBridge integration through Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the default operation performed when using the Apache Camel aws2-eventbridge component in a producer context?'
      answer: |
       'The default operation performed when utilizing the Apache Camel `aws2-eventbridge` component within a producer context is "putRule". This implies that by default, this component will put or create a new rule in the AWS EventBridge service.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "overrideEndpoint" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-EventBridge component, and under what conditions should it be set to true or false? Additionally, how does it interact with the "uriEndpointOverride" option?'
      answer: |
       'The "overrideEndpoint" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-EventBridge component is a boolean attribute that determines whether the endpoint needs to be overridden. This option should be used together with the "uriEndpointOverride" option. If you set "overrideEndpoint" to true, it means you''re providing a custom endpoint address instead of the default one. In contrast, when set to false, the default endpoint will be used. It is optional, and its value defaults to false if not specified explicitly. The "uriEndpointOverride" is where you would provide your custom endpoint URL when "overrideEndpoint" is set to true.'
    - question: '"In the context of using the Apache Camel aws2-eventbridge component, can I utilize a plain object (POJO) as the body for message production with the ''pojoRequest'' option, and is it required to do so?"'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the Apache Camel `aws2-eventbridge` component, you can indeed use a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) as the body for message production with the ''pojoRequest'' option. However, it is not required; by default, this option is set to false, meaning a POJO will not be used unless explicitly specified. This configuration falls under the ''producer'' group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "region" option in the Apache Camel aws2-eventbridge component, and what should be the format of the value when it is specified? Also, can you explain if it''s optional and whether there is a default value for this parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The "region" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-EventBridge component specifies the region where the Eventbridge client should operate. It''s essential to provide the lowercase name of the region (e.g., ap-east-1). When you use this parameter, your configuration will expect Region.EU_WEST_1.id() format for clarity. The "region" option is not mandatory; it has a null default value and belongs to the producer group in component settings.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the `uriEndpointOverride` option for the Apache Camel AWS2-EventBridge component, and what is its purpose when used in combination with the `overrideEndpoint` option?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the `uriEndpointOverride` option for the Apache Camel AWS2-EventBridge component, you should set it as a property with the value representing your overriding uri endpoint. This option is meant to be used in conjunction with the `overrideEndpoint` option. By using these options together, you can modify the default AWS EventBridge URI endpoint that the component would normally use. When you specify both `uriEndpointOverride` and `overrideEndpoint`, the combination allows for greater flexibility in directing the data flow between your system and AWS EventBridge. Keep in mind that the `uriEndpointOverride` option is not a required field, as its default value is null.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in an Apache Camel route using the aws2-eventbridge component affect the starting behavior and potential failures when initializing producers, compared to its default state?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in an Apache Camel route using the `aws2-eventbridge` component allows for a more flexible startup behavior, especially in situations where a producer may initially fail during the start-up process and cause the entire route to fail being started. In the default state, producers are actively initialized upon route startup. However, with "lazyStartProducer" enabled, the producer will only be started when the first message is processed. This means that if initializing the producer causes an issue (as can sometimes occur), the CamelContext and routes will still start up successfully without interference. Once the first message arrives, creating and starting the producer may take a little additional time, thus slightly prolonging the total processing time of the processing.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "eventbridgeClient" option within the Apache Camel component called "aws2-eventbridge", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "eventbridgeClient" option within the Apache Camel component named "aws2-eventbridge" serves to utilize an existing configured AWS Eventbridge client. This option has no default value. Its usage is not mandatory, as indicated by its "required: false". This means that while you can provide your own previously set up AWS Eventbridge client for use with this component, doing so is optional when using the aws2-eventbridge component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "proxyHost" option within the Apache Camel component "aws2-eventbridge", and is it required or optional? (Hint: It''s used to define a proxy host when instantiating the EventBridge client, has a type of ''string'', can be left null by default, and belongs to the "proxy" group.)'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyHost" option within the Apache Camel component "aws2-eventbridge" is designed to allow you to define a proxy host when initializing the Eventbridge client. It has a type of string and can be left null by default, meaning if no proxy host is specified, one will not be used. However, this option is not mandatory as indicated by the "required": false property. This option falls under the "proxy" group of properties, signifying its role in managing connection via a proxy server.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, requirement, and associated group of the Apache Camel component aws2-eventbridge option named "proxyPort" when using this option to define a proxy port during Eventbridge client instantiation?'
      answer: |
       'The "aws2-eventbridge" component''s "proxyPort" option is used to define a proxy port when setting up the Eventbridge client. By default, it does not have a specific value assigned ("defaultValue": null). This option accepts integer data types ("type":"integer"). It is important to note that using this option for defining a proxy port during Eventbridge client instantiation is optional, as indicated by "required": false. The associated group for this option is "proxy".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "proxyProtocol" option in the Apache Camel component "aws2-eventbridge", and what is its default value, as well as whether it is required to be set or not when instantiating the Eventbridge client?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyProtocol" option in the AWS2-EventBridge component of Apache Camel is designed to define a proxy protocol when setting up the Eventbridge client. By default, this option is set to HTTPS. However, setting this option is optional; it can be skipped if not needed during the instantiation of the Eventbridge client.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, type, default value, and requirement status of the ''accessKey'' option within the Apache Camel component ''aws2-eventbridge'' in terms of security configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The ''accessKey'' option in the Apache Camel AWS2-EventBridge component is intended for providing an Amazon AWS Access Key, specifically used for security purposes. Its data type is a string, but it does not have a default value provided. This key''s requirement status is set to optional or false, meaning you do not strictly need to supply it when configuring the component. The grouping of this option falls under ''security'', indicating its significance in securing interaction between your application and AWS services using EventBridge.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "profileCredentialsName" option within the Apache Camel AWS2-EventBridge component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option? (Answer: If using a profile credentials provider this parameter will set the profile name. The default value is null, and it is not mandatory to provide a value for this option)'
      answer: |
       'The "profileCredentialsName" option within the Apache Camel AWS2-EventBridge component serves the purpose of setting the profile name when using a profile credentials provider. If no profile is specified, the default value will be null. Providing a value for this option is not mandatory.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value (if any), data type, required status, and group association of the "secretKey" option in the Apache Camel component ''aws2-eventbridge'' and where does this option belong to within the context of security settings?'
      answer: |
       'The "secretKey" option in the Apache Camel component ''aws2-eventbridge'' is designed for providing an Amazon AWS Secret Key, which is typically used to sign requests that require authentication. In terms of its default value, it does not have one by default, meaning you''ll need to specify it during configuration. The data type assigned to this option is "string". Regarding its required status, the secretKey is set as optional (i.e., it can be provided or skipped in certain scenarios). Lastly, the "secretKey" option falls under the security group associated with your AWS settings within the Camel context. This is due to the sensitive nature of the Secret Key and its role in authenticating requests made through AWS services.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "sessionToken" option within the Apache Camel component named ''aws2-eventbridge'' in terms of AWS security? Furthermore, is it required and if not, does it have a defined data type?'
      answer: |
       'The "sessionToken" option in the Apache Camel ''aws2-eventbridge'' component is an Amazon AWS Session Token used when the user needs to assume an IAM role for security purposes. Its default value is null, meaning a Session Token must be provided explicitly if required. This option is not compulsory as indicated by "required: false". Lastly, it has a defined data type as a string, ensuring consistent handling of the SessionToken data.'
    - question: 'In the context of using Apache Camel''s AWS EventBridge component, what is the purpose and default value of the "trustAllCertificates" option within the security group when deciding whether to trust all certificates during an endpoint override?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using Apache Camel''s AWS EventBridge component, the "trustAllCertificates" option within the security group serves the purpose of determining whether to trust all certificates during an endpoint override. The default value for this boolean parameter is false, meaning that only trusted certificates are accepted. If you wish to bypass certificate verification and accept any certificate, you can set its value to true.'
    - question: 'How does setting the Apache Camel component `aws2-eventbridge` option "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" to `true` impact the behavior of the AWS EventBridge client with respect to loading credentials, compared to when this option is set to `false`? (Given that the default value for this option is `false`)'
      answer: |
       'Setting the Apache Camel component `aws2-eventbridge` option "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" to `true` allows the AWS EventBridge client to load credentials automatically through a default credentials provider, while setting it to `false` requires static credentials to be explicitly passed in. This means when the option is set to `true`, your AWS client will first try to find and use credentials saved on your system or configured with the AWS SDK, whereas if it''s set to `false`, you must manually provide credentials via the credentials properties in your Camel configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default setting for the option "useProfileCredentialsProvider" in the Apache Camel component "aws2-eventbridge", and what purpose does this option serve with regard to credential loading through a profile credentials provider?'
      answer: |
       'The default setting for the option "useProfileCredentialsProvider" in the Apache Camel component "aws2-eventbridge" is false. This option determines whether the Eventbridge client should expect to load credentials through a profile credentials provider. When set to true, it allows for loading AWS credentials using a named profile in your AWS CLI configuration file instead of hardcoding the access key ID and secret access key directly within the application.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "useSessionCredentials" option within the Apache Camel component "aws2-eventbridge" impact the authentication process and when would it be appropriate to use this option in a given integration scenario?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "useSessionCredentials" option in the Apache Camel component "aws2-eventbridge" allows your code to utilize Session Credentials for authenticating with Amazon EventBridge. This is beneficial when you need to assume an IAM role for carrying out operations in EventBridge, such as accessing resources or performing actions on behalf of the role. Although this option is optional and set to false by default, activating it within your integration scenario could help ensure that you can effectively manage permissions and enforce the principle of least privilege for your AWS resources.'
