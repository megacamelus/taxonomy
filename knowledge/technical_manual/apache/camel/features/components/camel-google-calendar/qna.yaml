    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", and is it required or optional to set a value for this option, as well as what would be an example of a valid string value for this option if provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" serves to specify the name of the Google Calendar application. While it''s not mandatory to provide a value for this option, it can be useful for identifying the specific instance or version of the Google Calendar app you are interacting with, such as camel-google-calendar/1.0. If left unset, the component will use a default value or possibly default to no application name specified.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" serves as the Client ID of your Google Calendar application. This value is used to authenticate your application with the Google Calendar API. However, it''s not a required parameter; you can choose whether or not to provide it when using this component. By default, the "clientId" option does not have a preset value.'
    - question: 'What is the configuration format for using a shared configuration in the Apache Camel component Google Calendar? Is it necessary to provide this configuration and if so, what type of data should be included in it?'
      answer: |
       'To use a shared configuration in the Apache Camel component Google Calendar, you would utilize an object format. This format is optional but can be provided for configuring the component collectively across various routes or applications. The data within this shared configuration object should include properties specific to your Google Calendar integration needs, such as OAuth credentials, calendar IDs, and any other settings that may apply to your use case. Keep in mind that the default value for this configuration is null.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component Google Calendar, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Calendar allows you to configure a delegate for wide-domain service account usage. This option is not mandatory as it has a default value of null. When you choose to provide a value, it specifies an email address to be used as the service account''s user or delegate when interacting with Google Calendar services.'
    - question: 'What are the possible values that can be assigned to the "scopes" option in the Apache Camel component ''google-calendar'', if you want to specify additional permissions beyond the default level, and where can you find more information about these scope values?'
      answer: |
       'In the ''google-calendar'' component of Apache Camel, the "scopes" option allows you to set additional permissions beyond the default level for a calendar application in a user account. You can specify multiple scopes by separating them with commas. For instance, if you want to access more than just the basic calendar events, you might use scopes such as "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events" or "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly". You can find a comprehensive list of available scope values and more detailed information about their usage at this link: https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/auth.'
    - question: 'Can you explain the purpose of the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Calendar, and under what conditions it is possible to configure this option to make exceptions thrown by the third-party component be processed as messages by the routing Error Handler?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Calendar allows for bridging errors from the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages will now be processed as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler. However, this is only possible if the third-party component (in this case, Google Calendar) allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. If the third-party component handles exceptions internally, then it''s not possible to configure the "bridgeErrorHandler". In situations where the Camel component can hook into the third-party component, this feature may be enabled for future releases. By default, if the "bridgeErrorHandler" is not configured, the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, which will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" affect the behavior of the producer, and what potential impact might it have on the overall processing time of messages?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" allows the producer to be deferred during the initial startup of the CamelContext and routes. This can help prevent route failures if a producer might otherwise cause issues during starting. When the first message is processed, the producer will then be created and started, potentially prolonging the overall processing time of messages due to this delay in initiating the producer. However, it provides a way to handle any startup failure during routing messages via Camel''s error handlers, improving the stability and reliability of your Camel routes.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", and do I need to set this option if it has a default value of true and is not marked as required?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" determines whether autowiring is enabled for automatic configuring components like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. It defaults to true, meaning that autowiring is enabled by default. Since it''s marked as optional and not required in your configuration, you do not need to explicitly set this option if you wish to use its default value.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientFactory" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", and can it be configured if set to ''false''? Also, what type of factory does it use by default?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientFactory" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" is an advanced configuration setting used to specify the factory for creating the Google Calendar client. By default, it uses the BatchGoogleCalendarClientFactory, which allows for batching multiple requests together for improved performance. If you set "clientFactory" to ''false'', it will not use a factory and instead create a single instance of the Google Calendar client each time the component is invoked. The factory used by default is an object type, specifically the BatchGoogleCalendarClientFactory.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", and is it mandatory to provide this token when using this component? Also, why is it recommended to use "refreshToken" instead for long term usage?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" is an OAuth 2 access token used to authenticate your application with Google Calendar API. However, it''s important to note that this token typically expires after an hour; therefore, it''s recommended for long-term usage to use the "refreshToken". The "refreshToken" can be used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires. Although providing the "accessToken" is not mandatory when using the component, it is crucial if you wish to interact with Google Calendar without requiring user intervention for re-authentication during the life of an access token. This information falls under the security group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" serves as the secret key for your calendar application, providing security when integrating with Google Calendar API. Its default value is null, meaning you need to provide a valid client secret that''s unique to your application. This option is considered optional, but for proper functionality and security, it''s strongly recommended to set a client secret during the configuration of your google-calendar component. This falls under the "security" group, emphasizing its importance in maintaining the integrity of your data exchange between Apache Camel and Google Calendar API.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "emailAddress" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Calendar, and is it required? Additionally, can you provide an example of how to set this option when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "emailAddress" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Calendar is intended for specifying the email address of the Google Service Account. This option is not mandatory as it has a default value of null, meaning if left unspecified, the component will not use a service account email. However, using a Service Account email can provide better security and control when interacting with Google Calendar.              To set the "emailAddress" option when using this component, you would modify your Camel configuration as follows:              ```java       GoogleCalendarComponent googleCalendarComponent = new GoogleCalendarComponent();       googleCalendarComponent.setEmailAddress("your-service-account-email@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com");              from("direct:start")           .to("google-calendar:// calendarId?emailAddress=your-service-account-email@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com");       ```'
    - question: 'What is the purpose or function of the "p12FileName" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", and is it required for the usage of this component? Also, what is the default value for this option, if any, and what type of data should be provided when setting this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "p12FileName" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" is designed to specify the name of the .p12 file containing the private key for your Google Service Account. While it''s not a required option, providing a value can enhance security by using a custom key instead of the default one. The default value for this option is null, meaning no specific .p12 file will be used if you don''t provide a custom value. When setting this option, make sure to provide a string that represents the name of your chosen .p12 file.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the `refreshToken` option in the Apache Camel `google-calendar` component to ensure that a new access token is obtained when the current one expires, thus enabling the component to work effectively in long-lived applications?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the `refreshToken` option for the Apache Camel `google-calendar` component, you can provide a string value containing your OAuth 2 refresh token. This token enables the Google Calendar component to obtain a new accessToken whenever the current one expires, which is essential for long-lived applications. Although it''s not required, setting this option will ensure seamless functioning of the component when dealing with extended application lifetimes.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "serviceAccountKey" option within the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", and what format should it be provided in, considering it''s used for authentication as a service account? Also, can you explain how to determine if this option is mandatory or optional based on the given information?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceAccountKey" option within the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" is intended for providing a service account key in JSON format. This key is crucial for authenticating an application as a service account with Google Calendar. To facilitate the transmission, it is recommended to encode the key as base64 and prepend the prefix "base64:" before the encoded string.              Regarding its usage, whether this option is mandatory or optional can be determined by the specific requirements of your use case. In the given information, it''s stated that the "serviceAccountKey" option is not required, meaning you can choose to omit it if you don''t need to authenticate as a service account with Google Calendar. However, keep in mind that using this option may be necessary for securely integrating your application with Google Calendar as a service account.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the "user" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component, and is it required when using this component? Additionally, where does the configuration for this option fall within the groups of settings?'
      answer: |
       'The "user" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component is designed to specify the email address of the user the application will impersonate during service account flow. This option is optional as indicated by its default value being null, meaning it is not necessary for the operation of the component if no specific user is required. The configuration for this option falls under the security group of settings, as it pertains to authentication and authorization with the Google Calendar API.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-calendar"?'
      answer: |
       'The "applicationName" option within the Apache Camel component called "google-calendar" is designed to specify the name of the Google Calendar application, such as camel-google-calendar/1.0. However, it has a default value of null, meaning that if no specific application name is provided, no application name will be set. This option falls under the common group of configuration settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar"?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" is used to specify the Client ID of your Google Calendar application. This ID is crucial for authentication purposes when you integrate Google Calendar with other applications, as it identifies your application to Google''s servers. By default, there is no predefined value for this option, meaning you must provide a valid Client ID when configuring this component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", and is it required? Also, where does this option fall under in the configuration groups for this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" serves the purpose of delegating access to a wide-domain service account. This option accepts a string value but has no default value ("defaultValue": null). Whether or not you provide a delegate is optional as indicated by "required": false. The configuration group for this specific option falls under the common category ("groups":"common").'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "inBody" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "inBody" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component is an optional parameter that allows you to set a value to be passed as part of the request body during the exchange. By default, this option has no specified value (defaultValue: null). Whether or not you need to use it when working with this component depends on your specific use case; if you need to send data within the request body, then you can provide a string value for this option. If not, you can leave it as its default value.'
    - question: 'What are the valid scope options for the "scopes" configuration in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component, and what is the default value if this option is not specified? Also, where can I find more information about the available scopes and their respective permissions?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of the Apache Camel Google Calendar component, the "scopes" configuration specifies the level of permissions you want a calendar application to have on a user account. The valid scope options can be separated by commas. For instance, if you wish to read, write, and delete events in a user''s calendar, you might set the scopes as: "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events".              The default value for this option is <https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar>. If you do not specify this option, it will be set to the default value by default.              For more detailed information about available scopes and their respective permissions, please refer to the official Google Developers documentation at: https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/auth.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Calendar affect the behavior of the polling consumer when no files are polled?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Calendar allows the polling consumer to send an empty message (no body) when it does not poll any files. This means that even if no new events are found within the specified duration, a signal will be sent, indicating that there were no changes to the calendar.'
    - question: 'How does the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel''s google-calendar component function, and under what conditions can it be configured to route exceptions as messages to the Camel routing Error Handler instead of using the default exception handler?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel''s google-calendar component allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which means any exceptions that may occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. This feature is only possible if the third-party component (in this case, Google Calendar) allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. Some components may handle exceptions internally and therefore bridgeErrorHandler is not possible in those cases. When configured, exceptions will be treated as messages instead of being logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored by default. By default, the consumer uses the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to handle exceptions, but when bridgeErrorHandler is enabled, it takes precedence. The bridgeErrorHandler can be found under the "consumer (advanced)" group of configuration options.'
    - question: 'How can I set a custom ExceptionHandler for errors occurring within an Apache Camel route using the Google Calendar component, and what happens when neither the bridgeErrorHandler nor a custom exception handler is specified?'
      answer: |
       'To set a custom ExceptionHandler for errors occurring within an Apache Camel route utilizing the Google Calendar component, you can make use of the "exceptionHandler" option. By default, the consumer will manage exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. However, if the "bridgeErrorHandler" is enabled, the "exceptionHandler" option becomes inactive. If neither the bridgeErrorHandler nor a custom exception handler is specified, the consumer will continue to handle exceptions as mentioned above. For advanced consumers who wish to implement their ExceptionHandler, they can do so by following the appropriate configuration within the consumer group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and usage of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel google-calendar component, and why might it be found under the "consumer (advanced)" group?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component is an optional setting that specifies the exchange pattern when a consumer creates an exchange. By default, this option has no value set. It determines how data flows between producers and consumers during the exchange process. Since it''s an advanced feature, you can find it under the "consumer (advanced)" group in the component''s configuration. This group is reserved for options that might not be required for basic usage but provide more control over the consumer behavior, allowing users to customize their integration more precisely.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "pollStrategy" option within the Apache Camel Google Calendar component, and what type of custom implementation can be provided for this option to control error handling during the poll operation before an Exchange is created and routed in Camel?'
      answer: |
       'The "pollStrategy" option within the Apache Camel Google Calendar component allows you to provide a custom implementation of org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy. This customization enables controlling error handling that typically occurs during the poll operation before an Exchange is created and routed in Camel. Essentially, it empowers you to tailor how errors are handled during the process of fetching data from Google Calendar within your Apache Camel routes, offering greater flexibility and control over your application''s behavior.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component, and under what circumstances might it be beneficial to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component allows you to defer the startup of the producer until the first message is processed. This can be useful in scenarios where the initial creation and starting of the producer may cause issues during the startup of the route, potentially leading to a failed route start-up.              By setting "lazyStartProducer" to true, you can handle any startup failures during the routing of messages via Camel''s error handlers. However, be aware that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time, extending the total processing time of the route. This option is considered advanced, grouped under "producer (advanced)".'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", and is it required when using this component? Also, can you explain how it interacts with the "backoffMultiplier" in case of error polls?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" determines the number of subsequent error polls that should occur before the "backoffMultiplier" kicks in, assuming an error has occurred during the polling process. By default, it does not have a set value, meaning it can be set to any integer value based on your specific use case requirements. Its purpose is to control the number of retry attempts before increasing the delay between retries using "backoffMultiplier". When an error occurs and the "backoffErrorThreshold" count is reached, the "backoffMultipler" multiplies the base delay time, causing a longer delay before the next poll attempt is made. This mechanism helps manage potentially continuous error scenarios by providing a controlled retry strategy in the event of errors with the Google Calendar API.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel `backoffIdleThreshold` option in the Google Calendar component, and is it a required configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The `backoffIdleThreshold` option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component is an integer-type configuration that specifies the number of subsequent idle polls before the backoffMultiplier should be applied. This means if your application is idling (not making any requests) for a certain number of times specified by this option, the backoff strategy will kick in to prevent overloading the Google Calendar API. The default value for `backoffIdleThreshold` is null, meaning there is no preset threshold, and it''s an optional configuration, not required for usage under the "scheduler" group.'
    - question: 'How does the "backoffMultiplier" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component (google-calendar) work, and why are the options "backoffIdleThreshold" and/or "backoffErrorThreshold" necessary when using "backoffMultiplier"? Can you also explain the purpose of the "defaultValue", its type, and whether it is required? Additionally, can you explain in which group this option belongs to in terms of configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffMultiplier" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component (google-calendar) is designed to allow the scheduled polling consumer to temporarily pause or "backoff" if a specific number of subsequent idles or errors occur consecutively. The value assigned to this option defines the number of skipped polls before the next attempt is made again.              When using the "backoffMultiplier", it''s essential to configure both "backoffIdleThreshold" and/or "backoffErrorThreshold". These options define the number of consecutive idle or error events required for the backoffMultiplier to be triggered. For example, if backoffIdleThreshold is set to 3, and the consumer has been idle for 3 consecutive polls, it will then skip the next three attempts before resuming normal operation.              The "defaultValue" refers to an initial value that a component or option may take if no explicit value is provided during configuration. In this case, the backoffMultiplier does not have a default value, so it can be left null. Its type is integer, as it requires numerical values to determine the number of skipped polls.              Lastly, the "backoffMultiplier" option belongs to the "scheduler" group in terms of configuration, indicating that it pertains to the scheduling and management of consumer polling in Apache Camel''s Google Calendar component.'
    - question: 'How can I set a delay (in milliseconds) between Google Calendar polls using Apache Camel''s google-calendar component, and what is the default value for this option if it is not explicitly specified?'
      answer: |
       'To set a delay between Google Calendar polls using Apache Camel''s `google-calendar` component, you can configure the "delay" option under the "scheduler" group. This option specifies the number of milliseconds before the next poll. If you do not explicitly specify this option, the default value is 500 milliseconds (half a second).'
    - question: 'What is the behavior of the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Calendar when it is enabled, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'When the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Calendar is enabled, the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again if the previous run polled one or more messages. This behavior allows for efficient handling of multiple events at once. However, it''s important to note that its default value is false, meaning the consumer does not automatically re-run in this manner unless explicitly set to true.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", and is it a required configuration parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" is an integer data type, with a default value of 1000 milliseconds (or one second). This configuration parameter is not required, meaning you can choose to provide it during setup or skip it if desired. It pertains to the scheduler group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum limit of times a Google Calendar endpoint will fire if the `repeatCount` option in Apache Camel''s google-calendar component is set to 5?'
      answer: |
       'The Google Calendar endpoint within Apache Camel will fire a maximum of 5 times when the "repeatCount" option is set to 5. This means that after it has fired five times, it will no longer execute further instances. If you wish for the endpoint to run indefinitely, you can set the "repeatCount" value to zero or a negative number.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible configuration range for the "runLoggingLevel" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component, and can it be configured optionally?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "runLoggingLevel" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component is TRACE. This option allows you to configure the logging level for the logs produced when the consumer polls. You can optionally configure this setting within the scheduler group, with possible values ranging from TRACE (most detailed) to ERROR (least detailed).'
    - question: 'How can you configure a custom or shared thread pool for an Apache Camel Google Calendar component''s consumer using the scheduledExecutorService option? And, what is the default value of this configuration option in case it is not specified explicitly?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom or shared thread pool for an Apache Camel Google Calendar component''s consumer, you can utilize the "scheduledExecutorService" option. By default, each consumer operates with its own single-threaded thread pool. However, by setting the "scheduledExecutorService" option, you can provide your own thread pool configuration. If this configuration option is not specified explicitly, it will default to null.'
    - question: 'What is the correct way to configure the scheduler option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component when using a cron scheduler, and what are the available options for implementing this scheduler (built-in or from external libraries)?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the scheduler option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component when using a cron scheduler, you can set the "component" as "google-calendar", the "option" as "scheduler", and provide either "spring" or "quartz" as the value for the built-in schedulers. These options are included in the "groups" labeled as "scheduler". If you require no scheduler, you can leave the "defaultValue" as none.'
    - question: 'What are the valid properties that can be set when configuring a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz/Spring based schedulers in Apache Camel''s google-calendar component, and is it required to set any specific property for this option (schedulerProperties)?'
      answer: |
       'When configuring a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz/Spring-based schedulers within Apache Camel''s google-calendar component, you can set additional properties using the "schedulerProperties" option. This option accepts an object type and is not required (indicated by the "required": false). The "defaultValue" is null, meaning there are no predefined default values for these properties. You may find relevant groups under "scheduler".'
    - question: 'When working with the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", if I want to manually control the start of the scheduler using the option "startScheduler", what is the default behavior and which group does this option belong to (if any)?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior when using the "startScheduler" option with the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" is that it will automatically start. This option belongs to the "scheduler" group. If you wish to manually control the start of the scheduler, you can do so by setting the value of this option accordingly.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the timeUnit option in the Apache Camel''s google-calendar component when used with the scheduler group, and what types of values can be provided for this option to specify the time unit for initialDelay and delay options?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s Google Calendar component, when working with the scheduler group, the default value for the "timeUnit" option is MILLISECONDS. This option allows you to specify the time unit for both initialDelay and delay options. You can provide values such as SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS, or DAYS to adjust the time interval based on your requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", and can it be configured when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" controls whether a fixed delay or fixed rate is used for scheduling tasks. By default, it is set to true, meaning a fixed delay is employed. This option follows the behavior of ScheduledExecutorService in Java''s JDK. If you wish to configure this option when using the google-calendar component, it can be done as it is an optional setting within the "scheduler" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component, and why would it be recommended to use the "refreshToken" instead for long-term usage?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component is an OAuth 2 access token used to authenticate your application when interacting with Google Calendar. However, this token typically expires after an hour, hence it''s not ideal for long-term usage. It''s recommended to use the "refreshToken" instead, as it allows you to refresh the access token periodically, ensuring continued and seamless access to Google Calendar services over a longer duration. This recommendation falls under the security group of options, emphasizing the importance of maintaining secure connections between your application and Google Calendar.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''clientSecret'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-calendar'', and is it required or optional?'

       'The ''clientSecret'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-calendar'' serves as the secret key associated with your calendar application. This secret is used to authenticate and authorize requests made to the Google Calendar API. By default, it does not have a value, as you will need to provide your own client secret obtained from the Google Developers Console during configuration. The ''clientSecret'' option is optional but highly recommended for security purposes, falling under the ''security'' group of options in the component settings.'

    - question: 'How can I configure the refreshToken option in Apache Camel''s google-calendar component to automatically obtain a new accessToken when the current one expires, ensuring smooth operation of my long-lived application?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the refreshToken option in Apache Camel''s google-calendar component for automatic obtaining of a new accessToken when the current one expires, you can follow these steps:              In your Camel route, set the "refreshToken" option to the OAuth 2 refresh token provided by Google. Although it is not required, you may use the "type" property as "string". This configuration ensures that Camel''s google-calendar component can request a new accessToken when needed, maintaining smooth operation in long-lived applications. Remember that this option belongs to the "security" group and is optional by default, so you can choose whether or not to include it based on your application requirements.              Here''s an example of how to set the refreshToken option:              ```java       from("google-calendar://...")           . googleCalendar(GoogleCalendarOperation.READ)               .refreshToken("<your_oauth2_refresh_token>") // Set the refresh token here       ;       ```'
    - question: 'What is the correct format for providing a service account key in JSON format using the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" when authentication is required as a service account, and is it necessary to provide this key if the "required" field is set to false?'
      answer: |
       'To authenticate an application as a Google Calendar service account using the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", you should provide a base64 encoded service account key in JSON format with the prefix "base64:".

    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "user" option within the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", and is it mandatory for its usage? Also, where does this parameter fit within the context of security in this component''s configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "user" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" is designed to specify the email address of the user the application will impersonate during service account flow. This option is not mandatory, meaning it can be left null by default. However, when set, it allows the component to authenticate as a specific user rather than using the default account. In terms of security, this parameter plays a significant role as it enables fine-grained access control, ensuring that the component only acts on behalf of authorized users within the Google Calendar service. This configuration aspect falls under the "security" group, highlighting its importance in maintaining secure interactions with the Google Calendar API.'
