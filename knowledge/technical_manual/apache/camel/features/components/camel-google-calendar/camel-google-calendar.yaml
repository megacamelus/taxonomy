    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" is an optional string type that provides the name of the Google Calendar application, if explicitly provided. Its purpose is to specify the name of the application for clarity, though it''s worth noting that a default value is not set and must be provided by the user if needed. This option falls under the "common" groups in terms of its use and relevance within the context of Google Calendar components in Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component ''google-calendar''? Is it required to provide a value when using this component? If not, what kind of data should be provided if I want to customize it?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component ''google-calendar'' is intended for specifying the Client ID of your Google Calendar application. It is used for authentication purposes when integrating with the Google Calendar API. By default, there is no predefined value for this option, meaning you need to provide a unique Client ID generated from the Google Developers Console if you wish to customize it. If you don''t want to provide a specific Client Id, the component will still function with the default behavior, but you may encounter authentication-related issues when accessing calendar data.'
    - question: 'What is the format for configuring the Apache Camel''s Google Calendar component when using a shared configuration option? Is there a default value provided for this option and is it optional to use?'
      answer: |
       'The format for configuring Apache Camel''s Google Calendar component with a shared configuration option is an object type. This option has no default value, making it optional to use. The group associated with this setting belongs to the common category.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''delegate'' option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component, and is it a required setting? Also, which group of options does this option belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The ''delegate'' option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component allows you to delegate for wide-domain service account. This means that another user can act on behalf of the calendar when needed. By default, it has no fixed value as it is up to the user to provide the appropriate email address. Regarding its requirements, the ''delegate'' option is not essential, meaning it can be left undefined if desired. Lastly, this option belongs to the common group of settings in Apache Camel Google Calendar component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "scopes" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component and what values (or types) should it contain if specified, and is its use optional? Also, where can one find more information about possible scope values for this option?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel Google Calendar component, the "scopes" option specifies the level of permissions you want a calendar application to have to a user account. You can specify multiple scopes by separating them with commas. The default value is `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`. While it''s not required, its use allows you to control the access that the component has to your Google Calendar data. For more information about possible scope values for this option, you can refer to the documentation provided at https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/auth.'
    - question: 'Here is a question related to the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component:              How does the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component differ from the default exception handling mechanism, and when would it be beneficial to use it instead of relying on the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component is a feature that enables bridging the consumer to Camel''s routing Error Handler, allowing exceptions (if supported by the third-party component) that occur while the consumer tries to pick up incoming messages to be handled as messages, rather than being logged and ignored.              In contrast, by default the consumer utilizes org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler for dealing with exceptions. This means any exceptions will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and disregarded.              It would be advantageous to use "bridgeErrorHandler" when you need a more structured approach for handling errors, as it allows the errors to be processed as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler instead of being discarded. Keep in mind that this is only possible if the third-party component supports alerting Camel about exceptions thrown. However, some components may handle exceptions internally only and therefore "bridgeErrorHandler" cannot be utilized with them. Future releases of Camel may improve certain components to make this option possible for more components.'
    - question: 'Given the provided information, here''s a potential question about the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel google-calendar component:              "What is the purpose and impact of the ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Google Calendar component for Apache Camel? Can you explain when it might be beneficial to set this option to true, and what potential drawbacks might occur as a result?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component is designed to allow the producer to start on demand (when the first message is processed), rather than during the startup of the CamelContext or route. This can be beneficial when a producer might otherwise fail during starting, preventing the route from being started successfully. Instead, by setting this option to true, such failure can be handled through Camel''s routing error handlers.              However, it is important to note that deferring the production startup until the first message leads to some potential drawbacks. Firstly, when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time, extending the total processing time of the operation. Secondly, if your application relies on having the producer ready immediately upon start-up, this option might not be suitable as the initial response may come with some delay due to the lazy initialization of the producer.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component Google-Calendar impact its functionality when configuring automatic autowiring of options such as data sources or AWS clients, and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component Google-Calendar allows for automatic autowiring of options like data sources or AWS clients during configuration. By setting this option to true, when an option is marked as autowired, Camel will search through the registry to locate a single instance of matching type, and then it will be configured onto the component. This can greatly simplify the configuration process for items such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc., since they can be automatically instantiated and connected instead of requiring explicit setup. The default value for this option is true, meaning autowiring is enabled by default.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" to use a specific clientFactory for creating the Google Calendar client, and is it optional to set this configuration?'
      answer: |
       'To customize the use of a specific `clientFactory` when working with the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", you can set the configuration property "component" as "google-calendar" and specify the option "clientFactory" with your desired implementation, such as BatchGoogleCalendarClientFactory by default. It is optional to set this configuration as indicated by "required": false within the advanced settings group of configurations.'
    - question: 'What should be considered when using the "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", and why might it be beneficial to use a "refreshToken" instead, especially for long-term usage?'
      answer: |
       'When working with the "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", it''s crucial to understand that this token typically expires after an hour. For prolonged usage, it is recommended to utilize the "refreshToken" instead. The reason being that refresh tokens have a longer lifespan and can automatically renew expired access tokens when needed. This ensures uninterrupted access to the Google Calendar API without requiring frequent manual token refreshes, making it more suitable for long-term usage scenarios. Additionally, consider that the "accessToken" is classified under the "security" group in the component configuration, highlighting its sensitive nature and the importance of secure handling and appropriate usage.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-calendar", and is it required? Is there any group under which this option falls?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component called "google-calendar" is a security-related parameter, used to provide a secret key for your Google Calendar application''s client authentication. This secret should ideally be set but is not required by default, as indicated by the "defaultValue": null. The group under which this option falls is "security".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and optional nature of the "emailAddress" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", and can it accept a default value if not provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "emailAddress" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" serves to define the email address associated with the Google Service Account. This parameter is optional, meaning that providing it is not a necessary prerequisite for using the component. If you do choose to supply an emailAddress value, ensure that it is in string format. By default, this option does not have any predefined value. Keep in mind that grouped under security considerations due to its relationship with authentication and authorization processes within the Google Calendar service.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel component google-calendar option called "p12FileName"? Can this option be marked as required when using the component?'
      answer: |
       'The "p12FileName" option within the Apache Camel Google Calendar component serves to provide a name for the .p12 file that contains the private key associated with your Google Service Account. By default, there is no preset value for this option, as it allows for user flexibility in selecting their preferred .p12 file. It''s important to note that this option falls under the security group of settings and its inclusion isn''t mandatory (i.e., it can be set to false if you don''t wish to provide a specific .p12 file). However, you may choose to mark it as required depending on your application requirements and desired levels of authentication.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of setting the "refreshToken" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component, and what kind of value should this option hold for using OAuth 2 refresh tokens to obtain a new access token when the current one expires?'
      answer: |
       'The "refreshToken" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component serves the purpose of managing OAuth 2 access tokens. This refresh token enables the Google Calendar component to acquire a fresh access token whenever the existing one becomes invalid, which is crucial for applications designed to operate over an extended period. In this context, the value for the "refreshToken" option should be the string representing the OAuth 2 refresh token obtained during the initial authorization process. This allows the component to request a new access token upon expiry of the current one, maintaining continuous and secure communication with the Google Calendar API.'
    - question: '"Can you explain how to properly set the ''serviceAccountKey'' option when using the Apache Camel component ''google-calendar'', if I have a service account key in JSON format that needs to be base64-encoded?"'
      answer: |
       'To properly set the ''serviceAccountKey'' option when using the Apache Camel component ''google-calendar'', first, ensure that your service account key is in JSON format. Next, encode the JSON as Base64 by adding the prefix "base64:" before the encoded data. Finally, you can configure the ''serviceAccountKey'' option with the resulting Base64-encoded string within your Camel route or configuration file.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" option named "user", which pertains to the email address of the user the application will impersonate when using a service account flow, and if this value is optional (can be left null)?'
      answer: |
       'The purpose of the "user" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" is to specify the email address of the user that the application will impersonate when using a service account flow within Google''s services. However, it is an optional value and can be left null, meaning no specific user email is set by default.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Calendar? Is it mandatory to set this option when using this component, and can you provide an example of its possible string format?'
      answer: |
       'The "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Calendar serves to specify the application name associated with your Google Calendar app. If left unspecified (as indicated by a null defaultValue), it won''t affect the functionality of the component, but it is recommended to set this option when working with multiple Google accounts or when integrating with other Google services. The string format for this option should ideally follow a camel case naming convention, such as "camel-google-calendar/1.0". This string provides details about your specific application version within the Google ecosystem, facilitating easier management and identification of various applications accessing Google Calendar API resources.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-calendar", and is it required or optional? Also, what is the default value for this option and what type of data should be provided if specified?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component called "google-calendar" is intended to provide a unique identifier for the calendar application used with Google Calendar. This option is optional as specified by "required: false". If you choose to supply a value for this option, it should be in string format, typically a long alphanumeric string provided by Google when registering your project. In the absence of a specific client ID, no default value is assigned for this option.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" when using a wide-domain service account? Additionally, is this option required, and if not, what are its possible values and groups it belongs to in terms of its use within common options?'
      answer: |
       'The "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", when using a wide-domain service account, serves the purpose of delegating permission to another user within Google''s domain. This allows the service account to act as that delegate. The default value for this option is null, meaning no delegate is set by default. This option is not required; therefore, it can take any string value that matches a user within the domain where the service account exists. The "delegate" option belongs to the common options group in terms of its usage within common components in Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''inBody'' option within the Apache Camel component ''google-calendar'', and is it required?'
      answer: |
       'The ''inBody'' option, found within the Apache Camel component ''google-calendar'', serves to set the name of a parameter to be passed in the exchange In Body. It has a default value of null, meaning no default value is specified for this option. Lastly, it is not required; its usage is optional and can be skipped if not needed during the exchange processing.'
    - question: 'What is the default array of permissions (scopes) that a Calendar application using Apache Camel''s google-calendar component can request from a user account, and which additional scopes can be specified to grant more or less access beyond the default value?'
      answer: |
       'The default array of permissions (scopes) that a Calendar application utilizing Apache Camel''s google-calendar component can request from a user account is `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`. For more or less access beyond this default value, you can specify additional scopes. Separate multiple scopes by commas. For detailed information about available scopes and how to use them, please refer to the Google Calendar API authorization documentation at <https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/auth>.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel "google-calendar" component, and can it be used optionally?'
      answer: |
       'The "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option within the Apache Camel "google-calendar" component is designed to control whether an empty message (no body) should be sent if the polling consumer does not find any files to process. By default, this option is set to false, meaning an empty message will not be sent when the component is idle. However, you can enable it optionally if you wish for it to function in this manner.'
    - question: 'Here is a question related to the Apache Camel component `google-calendar`''s `bridgeErrorHandler` option:              "What is the purpose of the ''bridgeErrorHandler'' option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component, and when should it be enabled or disabled?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''bridgeErrorHandler'' option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions (if possible) occurring while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. However, it''s important to note that this is only possible if the third-party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. In situations where the component handles exceptions internally, bridgeErrorHandler is not applicable. By default, the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler for dealing with exceptions. This will log such exceptions at WARN or ERROR level and ignore them unless explicitly enabled for your specific use case, falling under the ''consumer (advanced)'' group in Camel''s configuration settings.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom ExceptionHandler for errors that occur during Google Calendar operations using Apache Camel''s google-calendar component, when the bridgeErrorHandler is disabled?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom ExceptionHandler for errors that occur during Google Calendar operations with Apache Camel''s "google-calendar" component, ensure that the "bridgeErrorHandler" is disabled. Since you want to use a custom ExceptionHandler, set the "exceptionHandler" option in your route configuration. As mentioned, if "bridgeErrorHandler" is enabled, this option won''t be applicable. By default, Apache Camel will handle exceptions at WARN or ERROR level, but with this setting, you can specify a custom handler to process errors as needed. This configuration falls under the advanced group "consumer (advanced)". For instance:              ```java       from("google-calendar:...")           .exceptionHandler(MyCustomExceptionHandler.class);       ```'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "exchangePattern" option within the Apache Camel "google-calendar" component, and for what group of consumers is it considered an advanced feature?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option within the Apache Camel "google-calendar" component is an advanced setting that determines the exchange pattern when a consumer creates an event in Google Calendar. It''s important for controlling how data is exchanged between your application and the calendar service. By default, it has no value set, allowing you to decide on its behavior according to your specific use case requirements. This option is categorized under the "consumer (advanced)" group, which implies that it may not be necessary for all users, but those seeking more fine-grained control over data exchange may find it useful.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the pollStrategy option in the Apache Camel Google-Calendar component, how can I customize its error handling behavior, and does it have a default value?'
      answer: |
       'The `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel Google-Calendar component allows you to provide a custom implementation for error handling during the poll operation before an Exchange (a data structure holding inbound and outbound messages) has been created and routed within Camel. To customize its error handling behavior, you can supply your own implementation of `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy`. The default value for this option is null, meaning that no specific poll strategy is set if not provided otherwise. This feature falls under the advanced consumer group in Camel''s configuration.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component affect the behavior of the producer, and why might it be useful to set this option to true for some applications?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component allows the producer to begin only when a message arrives (lazy startup). This can be beneficial in scenarios where initiating the producer might lead to startup failures that prevent the entire route from launching successfully. By delaying the producer''s startup until messages are being processed, you can handle any issues through Camel''s routing error handlers without causing the initial startup of your application to fail.              However, keep in mind that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some extra time, which could extend the total processing time for each message. It''s recommended to use this option judiciously, especially for applications where efficient throughput is critical. This feature belongs to the "producer (advanced)" group of options in Apache Camel, indicating its more specialized and optional nature compared to other settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and function of the "backoffErrorThreshold" option within the Apache Camel "google-calendar" component in regards to the scheduler group, and can it be set if its default value is null?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffErrorThreshold" option within the Apache Camel "google-calendar" component is an integer that determines the number of subsequent error polls (failed due to some error) before the "backoffMultiplier" should kick in, as part of the scheduler group. Its default value is null, meaning it''s not set by default. If you wish to customize its value, you can do so when configuring your component.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "backoffIdleThreshold" option within the "google-calendar" component in Apache Camel''s scheduler group, if specified?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffIdleThreshold" option within the "google-calendar" component in Apache Camel''s scheduler group is an integer that specifies the number of subsequent idle polls before the backoffMultipler should take effect. By default, it does not have a defined value, meaning that you can manually set it if desired to configure how long the component should wait after successive idle polls before increasing the polling interval exponentially to manage heavy traffic or reduce load on the server.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "backoffMultiplier" option in the Apache Camel''s google-calendar component within the scheduler group, and what is its default value? Also, could you explain why setting backoffMultiplier requires the configuration of backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold as well?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffMultiplier" option in Apache Camel''s google-calendar component within the scheduler group serves to allow the scheduled polling consumer to pause or ''backoff'' if there have been multiple consecutive idles or errors. This multiplier represents the number of skipped polls before the next attempt is made again, providing a mechanism for resilience and reducing the risk of overwhelming the calendar service.              When you set the "backoffMultiplier", it requires that both "backoffIdleThreshold" and/or "backoffErrorThreshold" must be configured as well. These thresholds define the number of subsequent idles or errors, respectively, before the backoffMultiplier comes into play. In other words, if a specific number of idle states or errors occur in quick succession, the consumer will pause for the duration defined by "backoffIdleThreshold", "backoffErrorThreshold", or multiples thereof based on the "backoffMultiplier" value. This helps ensure that the calendar service is not repeatedly contacted in a short time frame when it''s likely experiencing temporary issues.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it is mandatory to use the ''delay'' option in the ''google-calendar'' component within Apache Camel when configuring the scheduler group?'
      answer: |
       'The ''delay'' option in the ''google-calendar'' component of Apache Camel, within the ''scheduler'' group, is an optional setting (since it''s indicated by the `required: false` field). Its purpose is to define the milliseconds before the next poll when working with Google Calendar. The default value for this option is 500 milliseconds, as specified by the `defaultValue: 500`. The data type of this value is an integer.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component affect the behavior of the ScheduledPollConsumer, and is there a default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar component means that if the ScheduledPollConsumer polls 1 or more messages during its previous run, it will trigger another immediate run. This allows for more frequent updates from the Google Calendar when new events are added. However, it''s important to note that this option is not required and by default, it is set to false, meaning the ScheduledPollConsumer does not automatically re-run under these conditions.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "initialDelay" option for the Apache Camel component Google Calendar, and is it a required configuration parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The "initialDelay" option for the Apache Camel Google Calendar component is an optional integer type property, defaulting to 1000 milliseconds before the first poll starts. This value determines when the first operation will initiate after your system has been started or rebooted.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum limit on the number of times an event will be fired when using the "repeatCount" option with the Apache Camel Google Calendar component in a scheduler, and what happens if this option is set to zero or a negative value?'
      answer: |
       'When utilizing the "repeatCount" option with the Apache Camel Google Calendar component within a scheduler, there exists a maximum limit on the number of times an event will be fired. If you set it to a specific number (e.g., 1 or 5), the scheduler will only fire that particular number of times. An interesting thing to note is that a value of zero or negative implies the event should fire indefinitely, i.e., "fire forever".'
    - question: 'What is the default logging level for the "start/complete" log lines produced by the "google-calendar" component''s consumer when it polls, and in what scenario can we choose to change this logging level?'
      answer: |
       'The default logging level for the "start/complete" log lines generated by the Google Calendar component''s consumer upon polling is TRACE. However, if you wish to adjust the verbosity of these logs, you have the option to do so by modifying the "runLoggingLevel" parameter. This is useful in scenarios where you want to control the level of detail displayed in your logs based on the specific needs of your application or for debugging purposes.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "scheduledExecutorService" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", and can it be configured without being required?'
      answer: |
       'The "scheduledExecutorService" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" allows for configuring a custom or shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default, each consumer has its own single-threaded thread pool, but this option enables you to configure a multi-threaded one if needed. However, it is not required and has no default value by default. If desired, you can configure this option within the "scheduler" group in your Apache Camel settings.'
    - question: 'What is the way to implement a cron scheduler with the Apache Camel Google Calendar component, and do we need to specify any default value for it if it''s optional?'
      answer: |
       'To implement a cron scheduler with the Apache Camel Google Calendar component, you can utilize either the camel-spring or camel-quartz component. You would set the "component" to "google-calendar" and the "option" to "scheduler". If you wish to use a built-in scheduler, specify "spring" or "quartz" for the "value". It''s important to note that the default value for this option is none, so you don''t need to set it if you want to opt out of using a cron scheduler.'
    - question: 'How can I properly set up custom properties for a scheduler when using the Apache Camel Google Calendar component (google-calendar) with an external scheduler like Quartz or Spring Scheduled? And, is it optional to provide such custom properties when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'When setting up a custom property configuration for the Apache Camel Google Calendar component (google-calendar) alongside an external scheduler such as Quartz or Spring Scheduled, you can do so by targeting the "schedulerProperties" option. This provides a means to configure additional properties when using a custom scheduler or any of the provided Quartz, Spring based schedulers. While not required, you have the flexibility to skip providing these custom properties if desired. To get started, ensure that your configuration groups are set up under "scheduler". For more specific details on the custom property setup and the available properties, please consult the component or scheduler''s official documentation.'
    - question: 'Given the information you provided, here''s a potential question about the Apache Camel component Google Calendar''s `startScheduler` option:              "When using the Google Calendar component in Apache Camel, what is the default behavior of the ''startScheduler'' option and can it be manually deactivated?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''startScheduler'' option for the Google Calendar component in Apache Camel defaults to being automatically started. However, it can also be manually deactivated if necessary.'
    - question: 'What is the default unit of time (options for ''initialDelay'' and ''delay'') used in the ''google-calendar'' component of Apache Camel when using the ''timeUnit'' option, and are there any alternative units of time available?'
      answer: |
       'In the Google Calendar component of Apache Camel, when using the ''timeUnit'' option for setting the initialDelay and delay values, the default unit is Milliseconds (MILLISECONDS). However, it''s essential to note that other time units may be available as alternatives.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior (i.e., true or false) of the "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", and under what circumstances can its value be overridden?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" is set to true, which means a fixed delay is used by default. This value can be overridden as it''s an optional configuration with a boolean type, provided that you specify another value while setting up your scheduler group. For more details about fixed delay and other execution strategies, refer to the ScheduledExecutorService in JDK documentation.'
    - question: 'What purpose does the "accessToken" option within the Apache Camel Google-Calendar component serve, why is it not typically used for long-term purposes, and what type of data should we expect when using this option? Additionally, is it a required parameter or can it be omitted in configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessToken" option within the Apache Camel Google-Calendar component serves as an OAuth 2 access token. This token grants limited access to your Google Calendar data for a specific timeframe, typically up to an hour. Due to this short expiry time, it is not recommended for long-term usage. Instead, the "refreshToken" is advisable for prolonged authorization. Regarding the type of data associated with using this option, it is a string. Lastly, while the access token is an available parameter, it is not required for configuration, hence it can be omitted if you prefer to use another method for authentication and authorization in your setup.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the `clientSecret` option in the Apache Camel `google-calendar` component, and is it required to be set?'

       'The `clientSecret` option within the Apache Camel `google-calendar` component serves as a security measure by providing the secret key of your calendar application. By default, it does not have a predefined value (`defaultValue`: null). This key is used along with the client ID in OAuth2 authentication process to access and manage Google Calendar data securely. The `clientSecret` is optional; you do not necessarily need to set it, but doing so ensures additional security when using this component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''emailAddress'' option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", and is it a required configuration parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The ''emailAddress'' option within the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" serves as an attribute for specifying the email address associated with the Google Service Account. By default, this field does not have a value (defaultValue: null). However, it is not mandatory to provide an emailAddress during the component configuration; its inclusion is optional (required: false). It falls under the security group of configurations due to its relationship with managing access and authentication within the Google Calendar API.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the "p12FileName" option in the Apache Camel''s Google Calendar component, and is its usage optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "p12FileName" option in Apache Camel''s Google Calendar component is used to specify the name of the .p12 file containing the private key for your Google Service Account. Its default value is null, meaning it needs to be set manually if you want to use a specific .p12 file. The usage of this option is optional, as indicated by its "required: false" property in the configuration. However, providing a valid .p12 file will enable secure communication between your application and Google Calendar services. It falls under the security group of options.'
    - question: 'How does using the refreshToken option within the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" help in managing long-lived applications with OAuth 2 access? If a refresh token is not provided, what default value would be used for this option, and is its use mandatory or optional?'
      answer: |
       'Using the `refreshToken` option within the Apache Camel component "google-calendar" facilitates the management of long-lived applications with OAuth 2 access. By providing a refresh token, the Google Calendar component can automatically obtain a new access token when the current one expires. This is essential for an application to keep functioning as intended without interruption even after the access token has expired. It''s important to note that if no refresh token is provided for this option, it will have a default value of null. However, using the `refreshToken` option is optional, meaning you can choose to provide one or let your application work with an access token that doesn''t require refreshing based on its lifespan. Keep in mind that the `refreshToken` option falls under the security group within component configuration.'
    - question: 'How should one properly structure a service account key in JSON format as a base64 encoded string when using the "serviceAccountKey" option within the Apache Camel google-calendar component for authentication purposes?'
      answer: |
       'To properly structure a service account key as a base64 encoded string within the "serviceAccountKey" option of the Apache Camel google-calendar component for authentication purposes, you should first create your service account key in JSON format from the Google Cloud Console. Then, encode this JSON data in base64. Lastly, prefix the base64 string with ''base64:'' before providing it as the value for the "serviceAccountKey" option when configuring the google-calendar component in Apache Camel. For instance: ''base64:<your_encoded_JSON_key>'', ensuring to replace ''<your_encoded_JSON_key>'' with your own base64 encoded JSON key.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "user" option within the Apache Camel component "google-calendar", under the "security" group, and is it required to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "user" option within the Apache Camel component "google-calendar," under the "security" group, serves to specify the email address of the user that the application will impersonate in the service account flow. By default, it doesn''t require a specific value; it can be left null if no specific user is intended for impersonation during the operation. However, providing a value for this option is optional, depending on your use case requirements and security settings.'
