    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel CQL component, and under what conditions does it allow for bridging errors to Camel''s routing Error Handler?'
      answer: |
       'The `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel CQL component allows for connecting the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages will be treated as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler. However, this function is only viable if the 3rd party component supports Camel being notified of an exception being thrown. Some components handle errors internally and do not allow for this bridge connection. In cases where the Camel component can be enhanced to integrate with the 3rd party component, this functionality may become available in future releases. By default, if `bridgeErrorHandler` is not enabled, the consumer will use the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler` to handle exceptions, which will log them at WARN or ERROR level and disregard them.'
    - question: '"What is the purpose and default value of the ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Apache Camel CQL component, and why might it be useful to set this option to true in certain scenarios?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Apache Camel CQL component allows you to defer the startup of the producer until the first message is processed. This can be useful in situations where initiating the producer may otherwise lead to a failure during the startup of the CamelContext or routes, potentially causing the entire process to fail.              By setting ''lazyStartProducer'' to true, you can handle startup failures more effectively using Camel''s routing error handlers. However, be aware that when processing the first message, creating and starting the producer might take some extra time, which could increase the total processing time of the process. The default value of this option is false, meaning the producer starts immediately when the CamelContext or route is started.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and usage scenario of the ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel CQL component, and if it''s not required, can it be safely disabled in an advanced configuration?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel CQL component, the ''autowiredEnabled'' option is a boolean parameter with a default value of true, which enables automatic autowiring of matching types in your configuration. This feature is particularly useful for configuring components such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, etc., by automatically looking up instances in the registry and setting them up for you.              While it''s not mandatory to have this option enabled (as indicated by the ''required'' field being false), you can safely disable it in an advanced configuration if you wish to manage these components manually or override the automatic autowiring behavior. However, be aware that disabling autowiring may require a more explicit configuration setup for these components.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, required status, and group association of the "clusterName" option within the Apache Camel CQL component?'
      answer: |
       'The "clusterName" option in the Apache Camel CQL component is a string type with no default value. It''s used to specify the name of the cluster, although it is not mandatory as it can be set to false under the "required" attribute. This option belongs to the common group within the Apache Camel configuration settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "cql" option in the Apache Camel CQL component, and is it possible to override this value using a message header?'
      answer: |
       'The "cql" option in the Apache Camel CQL component is designed to allow you to specify a CQL (Cassandra Query Language) query to be performed. By default, this value is not set ("defaultValue": null). It''s important to note that this option can be overridden using a message header with the key "CamelCqlQuery".'
    - question: 'What is the default datacenter value for the Apache Camel CQL component option named "datacenter", and is it required when using this option? Also, can you explain what the "datacenter" option in this context represents within the Apache Camel library?'
      answer: |
       'The default datacenter value for the Apache Camel CQL component''s "datacenter" option is "datacenter1". This option specifies the datacenter to be used, which helps in distributing data across multiple physical locations or regions for better performance and fault tolerance within the Apache Camel library. However, using a specific datacenter value with this option is not required.'
    - question: 'Can you explain the function of the Apache Camel CQL "prepareStatements" option, particularly if it is used in a scenario where the default value holds true, and if this setting is optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel CQL "prepareStatements" option determines whether to use PreparedStatements or regular Statements. If its default value (true) is maintained, it implies that PreparedStatements will be utilized, which can provide a performance boost by reusing prepared SQL statements with new values. However, it''s important to note that using this option is not always required; it is optional within the "common" group of settings in Apache Camel. If you choose not to use it, regular Statements will still be employed.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel CQL component''s "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option and under what group can it be found within consumer options?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel CQL component''s "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option is designed to control whether an empty message (no body) should be sent when the polling consumer does not poll any files. The default value of this option is false, meaning that an empty message will not be sent when idle. You can find this option within the consumer group under the CQL component''s settings.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom ExceptionHandler for the Apache Camel CQL component, considering that if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled, the exceptionHandler is not applicable, and by default exceptions are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. If I don''t want this default behavior, what steps should I follow to set up a custom ExceptionHandler?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom ExceptionHandler for the Apache Camel CQL component, you can utilize the "exceptionHandler" option within your configuration, however, be aware that if the option "bridgeErrorHandler" is enabled, then the "exceptionHandler" will not be in use by default. The default behavior is to log exceptions at WARN or ERROR level and ignore them.              If you wish to override this behavior with a custom ExceptionHandler, simply set up an object for the "exceptionHandler" option in your consumer configuration within the advanced group, providing a class that extends from org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler. Once this is set up, Camel will use your custom ExceptionHandler to handle exceptions, ensuring you can handle and process exceptions as per your requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel CQL component, and under which group of Camel configurations is this option considered?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel CQL component does not have a default value. Its purpose is to set the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. This option can be found within the advanced group of Camel configurations, specifically under the consumer group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel CQL option named "pollStrategy" when using it within a consumer context, and can you explain how to provide a custom implementation for this option if it''s necessary?'
      answer: |
       'The "pollStrategy" option in Apache Camel''s CQL (Component Query Language) is designed for use within a consumer context, specifically in the context of error handling during the poll operation before an Exchange (a unit of data transfer between Camel endpoints) has been created and routed. By default, this option doesn''t have a value. However, if needed, you can provide your custom implementation by creating a class that extends `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy`. This allows for the control of error handling behaviors according to your specific application requirements within the "consumer (advanced)" group of options in Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel CQL component, and under what conditions should it be set to true for a more graceful startup of routes in situations where a producer might otherwise fail during starting? Additionally, are there any performance implications when setting this option to true and how can potential startup failures be managed using routing error handlers?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel CQL component allows for a more graceful startup of routes in situations where a producer might otherwise fail during starting, preventing the route from failing entirely. By setting this option to true, the producer is deferred in startup, and will only be initialized upon the first message processing. This approach enables handling startup failures within Camel''s routing error handlers.              When "lazyStartProducer" is set to true, there may be a performance implication as creating and starting the producer during the first message processing can prolong overall processing time. However, it offers the tradeoff of allowing routes with problematic producers to start and operate effectively.              By leveraging Camel''s routing error handlers, potential startup failures can be managed efficiently. These handlers are responsible for handling exceptions thrown during message exchange in a route. When an error occurs, they enable you to specify alternate processing logic or recover from the error by retrying the message, moving on to another route, etc., allowing for a more robust and fault-tolerant application.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "extraTypeCodecs" option in the Apache Camel CQL component, and what valid values can be set for this option if we want to customize its behavior?'
      answer: |
       'The "extraTypeCodecs" option in the Apache Camel CQL component allows you to use a specific list of Extra Type codecs. These are used to handle certain data types beyond the standard ones provided by Cassandra, such as BLOB_TO_ARRAY, BOOLEAN_LIST_TO_ARRAY, BYTE_LIST_TO_ARRAY, SHORT_LIST_TO_ARRAY, INT_LIST_TO_ARRAY, LONG_LIST_TO_ARRAY, FLOAT_LIST_TO_ARRAY, DOUBLE_LIST_TO_ARRAY, TIMESTAMP_UTC, TIMESTAMP_MILLIS_SYSTEM, TIMESTAMP_MILLIS_UTC, ZONED_TIMESTAMP_SYSTEM, ZONED_TIMESTAMP_UTC, ZONED_TIMESTAMP_PERSISTED, LOCAL_TIMESTAMP_SYSTEM and LOCAL_TIMESTAMP_UTC. You can set these values by providing a comma-separated list when customizing the behavior of this option.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of using the "loadBalancingPolicyClass" option in the Apache Camel CQL component and what type of value should it receive, if configured?'
      answer: |
       'The "loadBalancingPolicyClass" option in the Apache Camel CQL (Cassandra Query Language) component is designed for configuring a specific LoadBalancingPolicyClass when connecting to Cassandra. If you choose to use this option, it should receive a string value representing the Java class implementing the LoadBalancingPolicy interface. This allows you to customize the load balancing strategy used by Camel when interacting with your Cassandra cluster. However, note that using this option is considered advanced configuration and may not be required for most use cases.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "resultSetConversionStrategy" option in the Apache Camel CQL component, and what are some valid values or patterns for this option that can be used to specify a custom class for converting ResultSet into message body?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s CQL (Component, Query Language), the "resultSetConversionStrategy" option serves the purpose of allowing you to use a custom class that implements logic for converting JDBC `ResultSet` objects into message bodies. This option is particularly useful when you need more control over how your data is processed before it reaches the next processing step in your Camel route.              Valid values or patterns for this option that can specify a custom class for converting `ResultSet` to message body could be any Java class name prefixed with "my.custom." or whatever package you have used, e.g., "my.custom.RowToMessageBodyConverter". It''s essential to note that this option is an advanced configuration setting in Camel CQL, and its usage may not always be required. If it is not provided, the component will use its default behavior to handle the conversion.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel CQL component''s "session" option, and should it be used in regular use cases or only in advanced configurations?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel CQL component''s "session" option is designed to allow you to use a specific Session instance within your integration. However, due to its nature, it is not commonly used in normal use cases as it provides more fine-grained control over database interactions. This option should generally be considered under advanced configurations when specific session management is required. By default, this option does not have a value assigned (defaultValue: null).'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel CQL component, and under what group (if any) does it fall under in terms of usage within the scheduler?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel CQL component is a configurable setting that specifies the number of subsequent error polls that should occur before the "backoffMultipler" should activate, essentially triggering a backoff or retry strategy when encountering errors during data retrieval. By default, it has no specified value, meaning you''ll need to provide an integer value to define how many consecutive error polls should happen before the backoff mechanism takes effect. This option falls under the "scheduler" group in terms of its usage within Apache Camel, as it pertains to scheduling and handling errors when interacting with external resources or systems.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel CQL option called `backoffIdleThreshold`, and can it be considered as a mandatory configuration when working with the scheduler group?'
      answer: |
       'The `backoffIdleThreshold` option in Apache Camel CQL is a configurable integer that determines the number of subsequent idle polls that should occur before the `backoffMultipler` kicks in. By default, this value can be set to null or any positive integer value. It''s important to note that setting the `backoffIdleThreshold` is not mandatory when working with the scheduler group, as it allows for configurable backoff strategies for polling components, but its absence will result in a more aggressive backoff strategy being employed without an explicit threshold set.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel CQL "backoffMultiplier" option, how does it work in relation to the "backoffIdleThreshold" and "backoffErrorThreshold", and what type of value should it typically accept, when configuring a consumer using the scheduler group?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel CQL "backoffMultiplier" option is utilized to permit the scheduled polling consumer to delay attempts if there have been a series of consecutive idles or errors. The multiplier indicates the number of polls that will be skipped before the next attempt occurs again. When using this option, it''s crucial to also configure "backoffIdleThreshold" and/or "backoffErrorThreshold". The "backoffMultiplier" works in relation to these options by determining the time period during which it waits before trying again, based on the number of errors or idles that have occurred. It typically accepts an integer value, signifying the number of skipped polls before resuming attempts.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "delay" option in the Apache Camel CQL component within the context of the scheduler group, and what is its default value and data type?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s Component Query Language (CQL), the "delay" option falls under the "scheduler" group. Its purpose is to specify the number of milliseconds before the next poll within the scheduler. This option is an integer data type and it can be omitted as its default value is 500 milliseconds.'
    - question: 'What is the function of the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel CQL component''s ScheduledPollConsumer, and what is its default value? If this option is enabled, will it affect how often the ScheduledPollConsumer runs subsequently when it has already polled one or more messages?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s CQL component, the "greedy" option for the ScheduledPollConsumer is intended to influence its behavior if a previous run has fetched one or more messages. If "greedy" is enabled (set to true), it means that the ScheduledPollConsumer will trigger another immediate run after the initial one. Conversely, if it''s disabled (the default value is false), subsequent runs will operate according to their originally scheduled intervals.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the Apache Camel CQL option "initialDelay" and can it be specified as a required or optional parameter in the scheduler group?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel CQL option "initialDelay" has a default integer value of 1000 milliseconds, meaning the first poll starts after this delay. This option can be found within the "scheduler" group, and it''s set as an optional parameter.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior for the repeatCount option in the Apache Camel CQL component when using the scheduler, and what happens if this option is not specified during configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the repeatCount option in the Apache Camel CQL component, when utilizing the scheduler, is infinite repetition as the defaultValue is set to 0. If the repeatCount option is not specified during configuration, it will continue to fire without any limit on the number of times.'
    - question: 'How can I set a custom logging level for the start/complete log lines generated by the Camel CQL component''s consumer when it polls, from the default value of TRACE? (Hint: This option is called ''runLoggingLevel'')'
      answer: |
       'To customize the logging level for the start/complete log lines generated by the Camel CQL component''s consumer when it polls, you can set the ''runLoggingLevel'' option. By default, this is set to TRACE, but you can modify it according to your preferences. You can adjust it to levels such as DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, or FATAL depending on the level of detail you require in your logs. This option falls under the scheduler group, so you should specify it during the configuration of your scheduler setup.'
    - question: '"What is the purpose and default value of the ''scheduledExecutorService'' option in the Apache Camel CQL component, and are there any specific requirements for using this option?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''scheduledExecutorService'' option in the Apache Camel CQL component allows for configuring a custom or shared thread pool to be used by the consumer. By default, each consumer has its own single-threaded thread pool. This option is not mandatory; its usage is optional. If this option is set, it overrides the default behavior and uses the configured thread pool. This setting falls under the scheduler group of configurations in the CQL component. The default value for this option is null, meaning that no custom thread pool is used when left unset.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the Cron Scheduler option within the Apache Camel CQL component when using either Camel Spring or Camel Quartz, and what are the valid values for the scheduler in this context?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Cron Scheduler option within the Apache Camel CQL component, you can use either the camel-spring or camel-quartz components. For built-in schedulers, set the value to either "spring" or "quartz". If no specific scheduler is required, simply leave the option as "none". These options are part of the "scheduler" group in your configuration settings.'
    - question: 'What are the valid configuration options for the "schedulerProperties" in the Apache Camel CQL component when using a custom scheduler or any of the provided schedulers like Quartz or Spring, and if no such properties are specified, is there a default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "schedulerProperties" in the Apache Camel CQL component allows you to configure additional properties when utilizing a custom scheduler or any of the provided schedulers such as Quartz or Spring. This object-based configuration is optional, meaning it''s not necessary to include these properties if not using a custom scheduling solution. There is no default value for these properties; therefore, they must be explicitly set according to the requirements of the chosen scheduler.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel CQL component to disable automatic start of the scheduler, if it is currently set to be automatically started?'
      answer: |
       'To disable the automatic start of the scheduler in Apache Camel CQL component, you need to configure the option "startScheduler" to false. As the default value is true, you only need to provide this option when starting up the component if it''s currently set to be auto-started. Here is an example configuration snippet:              ```java       CqlComponent cqlComponent = new CqlComponent();       cqlComponent.setStartScheduler(false);       // other configurations...       ```              In this example, the `startScheduler` option is explicitly set to false to disable the automatic start of the scheduler in the CQL component.'
    - question: 'What is the default time unit for the Apache Camel CQL `initialDelay` and `delay` options in the context of a scheduler, if no specific time unit is provided for these options? And is it optional to specify a time unit for these options?'
      answer: |
       'The default time unit for the `initialDelay` and `delay` options within Apache Camel''s CQL scheduler, when no specific time unit is supplied, is Milliseconds (MILLISECONDS). It''s also not mandatory to explicitly specify a time unit for these options as they can be omitted if this default value is the intended choice.'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel CQL component''s useFixedDelay option function, and can it be set to false? The option controls whether fixed delay or fixed rate is used, and it has a default value of true. It''s also worth noting that this option is not required.'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel CQL component''s `useFixedDelay` option determines whether a fixed delay or fixed rate is applied when scheduling tasks. When set to true (which is the default value), it employs a fixed delay between each task execution. If you wish to change this behavior and use fixed rate instead, you can set its value to false. However, keep in mind that this option is optional, meaning it can be left unspecified if the default setting suits your requirements. For more details on how this works, I would recommend reviewing the documentation for Java''s ScheduledExecutorService.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, requirement status (optional or required), and applicable groups for the Apache Camel CQL option named "password"?'
      answer: |
       'The "password" option in Apache Camel''s Component Query Language (CQL) is designed for session authentication purposes. It does not have a default value (defaultValue: null). The data type for this option is a string ("type": "string"). Whether it is required or optional depends on the specific use case as it is marked as ''optional'' in this context (required: false). Lastly, this option falls under the security groups (groups: "security") of Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, optional status, and group assignment of the Apache Camel CQL component option named ''username''?'
      answer: |
       'The purpose of the ''username'' option within the Apache Camel CQL component is for session authentication. By default, it does not have a value (defaultValue: null). Its data type is string. It is an optional feature (required: false) and falls under the security group (groups: "security").'
