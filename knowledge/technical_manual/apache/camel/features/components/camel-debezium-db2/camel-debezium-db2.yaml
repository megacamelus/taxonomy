    - question: 'What is the purpose of using the "additionalProperties" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2", and how can you set specific Kafka Connect properties for Debezium engine using this option, including setting the URL of a Schema Registry?'
      answer: |
       'The "additionalProperties" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2" is utilized when direct configuration of certain properties on camel configurations isn''t possible. This is particularly useful for settings that are specific to Kafka Connect properties required by the Debezium engine, such as configuring KafkaOffsetBackingStore or URL of a Schema Registry.              To set Kafka Connect properties like Schema Registry URL, you would use the format "additionalProperties.SCHEMA_PROPERTY_NAME=VALUE", for instance: "additionalProperties.schema.registry.url=http://localhost:8811/avro". Similarly, to set a unique ID for the transactional connection, you would use "additionalProperties.transactional.id=12345".              Keep in mind that these values can be adjusted according to your specific requirements, but they must always follow the aforementioned format to indicate properties meant for Debezium engine and include the "additionalProperties" prefix.'
    - question: 'Here is a potential question that can be answered using the provided information about the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component''s `bridgeErrorHandler` option:              "Can you explain how to configure the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component and what its effect is on exception handling when set to true?"              With the provided information, we know that:       1. The bridgeErrorHandler option allows for bridging exceptions to the Camel routing Error Handler instead of being logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.       2. By default, the consumer uses org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to handle exceptions when the bridgeErrorHandler is not set or false.       3. Some components may handle exceptions internally only and the bridgeErrorHandler is not possible in those situations.       4. Improvements to Camel component may make this possible in future releases for more components.'
      answer: |
       'To configure the `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, you need to set its value to true. When `bridgeErrorHandler` is set to true, exceptions occurring during message consumption will be treated as regular messages and handled by the routing Error Handler instead of being logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. However, please note that not all third-party components support this functionality. If a component handles exceptions internally only, the `bridgeErrorHandler` is not applicable in those situations. Improvements to the Camel component may make it possible for more components to utilize this feature in future releases. By default, if `bridgeErrorHandler` is not set or its value is false, the consumer will use org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to manage exceptions.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "configuration" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2", and is it optional or required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "configuration" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2" allows for pre-configured settings to be set. It does not have a default value. Using this option is optional when working with the "debezium-db2" component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "internalKeyConverter" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2", and is it required for configuration? (Hint: It''s used for serializing and deserializing key data for offsets, and its type is string.)'
      answer: |
       'The "internalKeyConverter" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2" serves the purpose of specifying a Converter class to serialize and deserialize key data for offsets. By default, the JSON converter (org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter) is utilized for this functionality, although it is not strictly required in the configuration. The group associated with this option is "consumer".'
    - question: 'What is the default internalValueConverter class used by the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component when serializing and deserializing value data for offsets, and can it be configured to use a different Converter class if desired?'
      answer: |
       'The default internalValueConverter class used by the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component when handling value data for offsets is org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter. However, it can be configured to use a different Converter class if desired, as the option is marked as "optional".'
    - question: 'What are the possible values for the "offsetCommitPolicy" option in Apache Camel''s Debezium-DB2 component, and what does it do? How can you configure a custom offset commit policy class, and is it necessary to provide a value if the default value is already a periodic one based on time intervals?'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s Debezium-DB2 component, the "offsetCommitPolicy" option refers to the name of a Java class that implements the ''OffsetCommitPolicy'' interface, defining when offset commits should be triggered. The default value is a periodic commit policy based on time intervals. If you wish to configure a custom offset commit policy class, simply provide the name of your desired class within this option. However, it''s important to note that if the default value (periodic commit policy based on time intervals) already suits your needs, it''s not necessary to provide a specific value for this option.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum duration, in milliseconds, that can be set for the `offsetCommitTimeoutMs` option in the Apache Camel `debezium-db2` component, and what is its default value if this setting is not explicitly defined? Also, where does this setting belong in terms of consumer-related configurations within this specific component?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component, the maximum duration that can be set for the `offsetCommitTimeoutMs` option is specified in milliseconds. The default value for this option, if not explicitly defined, is 5000 milliseconds or 5 seconds. This setting belongs to the consumer-related configurations within this specific component and pertains to managing how long a process waits for records to flush and partition offset data to be committed to offset storage before cancelling and restoring the offset data for a future attempt.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the "offsetFlushIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2", and can it be set or is it an optional setting?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetFlushIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2" serves to define the interval at which offset commits are attempted, with a default value of 60 seconds (or 60000 milliseconds). This setting is optional as indicated by the "required": false in the information provided. It falls under the group of settings related to consumers. If required, you can adjust this interval according to your specific use-case.'
    - question: 'What is the default and optional Java class responsible for persisting connector offsets in Apache Camel''s debezium-db2 component when offsetStorage option is not specified?'
      answer: |
       'In the absence of specifying the offsetStorage option with the Debezium DB2 component in Apache Camel, the default Java class responsible for persisting connector offsets is org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.FileOffsetBackingStore. It''s worth noting that this is optional, and you can specify a different Java class if needed.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "offsetStorageFileName" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component, and what should its value be when using the FileOffsetBackingStore for offset storage?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageFileName" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component is used to specify the file path where offsets are stored when the "offset.storage" configuration is set to the FileOffsetBackingStore. Its value should be a valid file path on your system if you choose to use this storage mechanism for offset management. However, please note that setting the "offsetStorageFileName" option as required is optional in the component''s configuration.'
    - question: 'How many partitions are used for offset storage when configuring the KafkaOffsetBackingStore in a Debezium-DB2 consumer within Apache Camel, if the number of partitions is explicitly specified, and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'When configuring the KafkaOffsetBackingStore in a Debezium-DB2 consumer within Apache Camel, if you explicitly specify the number of partitions for offset storage, it depends on the value you set for "offsetStoragePartitions". The default value for this option is null, meaning no specific number of partitions will be used for offset storage. You can adjust this number to suit your requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component''s offsetStorageReplicationFactor option, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option when using KafkaOffsetBackingStore as the offset storage?'
      answer: |
       'The `offsetStorageReplicationFactor` option within the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component determines the replication factor used when creating the offset storage topic. This factor is relevant when the offset storage is set to KafkaOffsetBackingStore. However, it''s worth noting that the default value for this option is null. Therefore, providing a value for `offsetStorageReplicationFactor` is not mandatory but can be overridden if specific replication requirements are needed. The group associated with this option falls under consumer settings in Camel components.'
    - question: 'What should be the value of the "offsetStorageTopic" option in a Apache Camel configuration using the debezium-db2 component, when the offset.storage is set to KafkaOffsetBackingStore?'
      answer: |
       'When using the debezium-db2 component in an Apache Camel configuration and setting the `offset.storage` to KafkaOffsetBackingStore, you can optionally specify the name for the Kafka topic where offsets will be stored by setting the "offsetStorageTopic" option. For example:              ```       debezium-db2(offset.storage=KafkaOffsetBackingStore, offsetStorageTopic=my-offset-topic)       ```'
    - question: 'How does the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel''s debezium-db2 component impact automatic configuration of options, specifically concerning JDBC data sources and AWS clients, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in Apache Camel''s Debezium-DB2 component determines whether automatic autowiring for certain options is enabled. When set to true (its default value), this feature allows the component to look up in the registry for a single instance of matching type for JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, and so forth. This streamlines the configuration process by automatically configuring these components. Therefore, if you want to take advantage of this automatic configuration for your JDBC data sources and AWS clients, make sure that "autowiredEnabled" is set to true in your Debezium-DB2 component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''columnExcludeList'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component and can you provide an example of its usage as a regular expression to exclude specific columns from change events? (If it doesn''t have a default value, does that mean we should not include it if we don''t wish to exclude any columns?)'
      answer: |
       'The ''columnExcludeList'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component allows you to specify regular expressions matching columns to exclude from change events. This means you can filter out specific columns based on their names, making the change data capture (CDC) process more focused. If the ''columnExcludeList'' is not provided with a default value, it suggests that all columns will be included in the change events if no explicit exclusion is needed.              Here''s an example of its usage as a regular expression: Suppose you want to exclude all columns starting with ''old_''. You could set the ''columnExcludeList'' option to ''\b old_\w+\b''. In this example, \b defines word boundaries, old\_ matches literally the string "old\_", and \w+ matches one or more word characters. This regular expression will match any column name starting with ''old_'', thus excluding those columns from change events.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "columnIncludeList" option for the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "columnIncludeList" option for the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component is used to specify regular expressions that match columns to include in change events. Its default value is null, meaning that no column inclusion is defined by default. This option is considered optional, as you can choose whether or not to use it based on your specific data requirements.'
    - question: 'How does the configuration option `columnPropagateSourceType` within the Apache Camel component `debezium-db2` function, and what is its default value? Also, under which group of configurations does it belong if not required, and is it a string type option?'
      answer: |
       'The configuration option `columnPropagateSourceType` within the Apache Camel component `debezium-db2` functions by allowing a comma-separated list of regular expressions matching fully-qualified column names. If matched, these columns will have their original data type and length added as parameters to the corresponding field schemas in the emitted change records. This option is of string type, and its default value is null. It falls under the `db2` group of configurations, indicating it applies specifically to DB2 database connections with the Debezium connector, and it''s an optional configuration (as it can be set as false or not provided if desired).'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the ''converters'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and what is the default value for this option, if any, along with its data type and whether it is required or not?'
      answer: |
       'The ''converters'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component is an optional feature allowing you to specify a list of custom converters instead of default ones. These custom converters can be defined using the ''.type'' config option, and their configurations are done using the options starting with a dot. The data type for this option is ''string'', but it''s worth noting that each individual converter definition would likely involve other configuration details. By default, no custom converters are set for this option. It''s not a required configuration, meaning you can use the default converters if preferred. This group of options pertains specifically to DB2-related configurations in Camel.'
    - question: 'What are the possible formats for configuring custom metric tags in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component when defining custom names for a Management Bean Object (MBean)?'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s Debezium DB2 component, the format for configuring custom metric tags for a Management Bean Object (MBean) is through key-value pairs. Each key represents a tag for the MBean object name, and its corresponding value is the desired tag value. For example, you can configure it as "k1=v1,k2=v2", where k1 and v1 are the first tag''s key and value respectively, and similarly for k2 and v2. This customization allows you to append custom tags to the end of the regular MBean object name, making it easy to identify specific instances. It is important to note that this feature is optional, and if not provided, it will have no default value.'
    - question: 'What is the optional string parameter "databaseDbname" in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-db2'' used for, and what is its default value and data type?'
      answer: |
       'The parameter "databaseDbname" in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-db2'' is an optional string parameter that specifies the name of the database from which the connector should capture changes. Its default value is null, meaning it isn''t set by default. This parameter is used to identify the particular DB2 database that you want the Debezium connector to monitor for data changes.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "databaseHostname" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2", and is it a required configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseHostname" option within the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2" defaults to null, meaning it does not have an initial value set. This option represents the resolvable hostname or IP address of the database server and has a data type of string. It is not a required configuration; therefore, it can be provided when configuring the component if needed. The group for this configuration option is "db2".'
    - question: 'What is the required string parameter named "databasePassword" in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and what purpose does it serve in connection with the target database? Additionally, is this parameter optional or mandatory for configuring the debezium-db2 component in a Camel route?'
      answer: |
       'The "databasePassword" parameter in the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component is a required string value used to specify the password of the database user that will be utilized when connecting to the target DB2 database. In essence, it is necessary for establishing authentication and granting access to your configured database with the provided credentials. Therefore, this parameter is essential for configuring the Debezium-DB2 component in a Camel route.'
    - question: 'What is the default port for the debezium-db2 component''s databasePort option in Apache Camel, if it is not specified (i.e., when the ''required'' value is false)? And what data type does this option expect?'
      answer: |
       'The default port for the "databasePort" option of the "debezium-db2" component in Apache Camel is 50000, if it''s not specified. This option expects an integer as its data type.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "databaseUser" option in the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component, and is it mandatory or optional to provide this value?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "databaseUser" option in the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component is null, meaning no default user is set. Providing this value is optional as it can be specified if you wish to use a specific database user when connecting to the database, otherwise the system will attempt to connect without explicit user credentials under the "db2" group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "datatypePropagateSourceType" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2", and are there any specific requirements or groups associated with this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "datatypePropagateSourceType" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2" is designed to propagate the original database-specific data type and its length to the corresponding field schemas in the emitted change records. This is achieved by providing a comma-separated list of regular expressions matching the data type names in your database. By default, this option has no value set (defaultValue: null). It''s important to note that this option is optional and can be used only within groups specified as "db2".'
    - question: 'What are the available options for the decimalHandlingMode property in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and how do they affect the representation of DECIMAL and NUMERIC columns in change events? Additionally, is there a default value for this option and is it mandatory to specify it?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component, the `decimalHandlingMode` property offers three options for representing DECIMAL and NUMERIC columns in change events: ''precise'' (default), ''string'', and ''double''. The ''precise'' option utilizes java.math.BigDecimal, encoding the values using a binary representation and Kafka Connect''s ''org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Decimal'' type, providing maximum precision. The ''string'' option uses string to represent values, while the ''double'' option employs Java''s double to represent values with possibly reduced precision but easier handling by consumers. You can find this property under the DB2 group, and it is not mandatory to specify it; if not provided, the default value of ''precise'' will be used.'
    - question: 'What is the default and maximum value for the ''errorsMaxRetries'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-db2'', and can it be configured even if not explicitly required? Also, what type of value is expected for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the ''errorsMaxRetries'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-db2'' is unlimited (-1). The maximum configurable value for it is not specified as the option accepts integer values. Yes, even if it''s not explicitly required, you can configure this option as its ''required'' value is false. The type of value expected for this option is an integer.'
    - question: 'What are the different modes for handling failure during processing of events in Apache Camel''s Debezium DB2 component, and what is the default value for ''eventProcessingFailureHandlingMode'' option and which group does this option belong to?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel''s Debezium DB2 component, you can configure how failures during event processing should be handled using the ''eventProcessingFailureHandlingMode'' option. The available modes are: ''fail'' (default), where an exception is raised upon encountering a corrupted event and the connector stops; ''warn'', where the problematic event and its position will be logged, but the event will be skipped; and ''ignore'', which allows skipping of the problematic event. This option belongs to the "db2" group. The default value for ''eventProcessingFailureHandlingMode'' is ''fail''.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and group of the "heartbeatIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-db2'', and is it required? Additionally, does it have a non-zero value if enabled, and what units are used for its duration?'
      answer: |
       'The "heartbeatIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-db2'' is designed to specify an interval (in milliseconds) during which the connector periodically sends heartbeat messages to a designated heartbeat topic. If you set it to 0, heartbeat messages will be disabled by default. However, if enabled, the interval can take any non-zero value in milliseconds as its unit. The data type for this option is "duration" and it belongs to the ''db2'' group. It''s worth noting that the "heartbeatIntervalMs" option is not required.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "heartbeatTopicsPrefix" option in the Apache Camel''s debezium-db2 component, and can it be configured even if its use is not mandatory? (The answer to these questions is that the default value is "__debezium-heartbeat" and it is a string, and yes, it can be configured since "required": false.)'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "heartbeatTopicsPrefix" option in Apache Camel''s debezium-db2 component is "__debezium-heartbeat". It is of data type string, and you can configure it even if its use is not mandatory as indicated by the "required": false.'
    - question: 'Given that the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component''s "includeSchemaChanges" option describes whether the connector should publish changes in the database schema to a Kafka topic, what is the default value for this option and is it mandatory (required) to set this option?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "includeSchemaChanges" option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component is true, meaning that the connector will publish changes in the database schema to a Kafka topic by default. However, it''s important to note that setting this option is not mandatory; you can choose to disable it if needed, but the default behavior is for schema changes to be published to a topic with the same name as the database server ID.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible data type of the "incrementalSnapshotChunkSize" option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-db2''? Can it be specified as a configuration property when using this component? And if not, which groups does it belong to (if any)?'
      answer: |
       'The "incrementalSnapshotChunkSize" option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-db2'' has a default value of 1024 (an integer). It defines the maximum size of a chunk (number of documents/rows) for incremental snapshotting during data replication. This option can be specified as a configuration property when using this component, but it is not required. The "incrementalSnapshotChunkSize" belongs to the ''db2'' groups in the configuration.'
    - question: 'What are the different strategies available for watermarking during an incremental snapshot in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2", and could you explain the differences between ''insert_insert'' and ''insert_delete'' strategies in terms of how they write open and close signals into the signal data collection?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2," there are two different strategies available for watermarking during an incremental snapshot: ''insert_insert'' and ''insert_delete''. The ''insert_insert'' strategy is set as default, where both the open and close signal is written into the signal data collection. This means that when an incremental snapshot is taken, both the start (open) and end (close) time stamps are recorded in the signal data collection.              On the other hand, the ''insert_delete'' strategy only writes the open signal on the signal data collection, with the close signal being marked for deletion of the corresponding open signal at a later stage. This approach allows for a more efficient process as it reduces the amount of data being stored in the signal data collection, but requires additional operations to handle the deletion of closed snapshots. The choice between these strategies depends on specific use-cases and the desired balance between efficiency and data management.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the maxBatchSize option for the debezium-db2 component in Apache Camel when this configuration property is not explicitly set, and is it required? Also, under which group does this option belong?'
      answer: |
       'The "maxBatchSize" option for the "debezium-db2" component in Apache Camel does not require explicit setting, having a default value of 2048. This option is an integer, specifying the maximum size of each batch of source records from the DB2 database. The group this option belongs to is "db2".'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the maxQueueSize option in the Apache Camel''s debezium-db2 component and under what conditions might it be necessary to increase this value?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `maxQueueSize` option in Apache Camel''s Debezium-DB2 component is 8192 (eight thousand, one hundred and ninety-two). This option determines the maximum size of the queue for change events read from the database log but not yet recorded or forwarded. It should be larger than the maximum batch size as specified in your configuration. Increasing this value may become necessary under conditions where a high volume of change events is expected, ensuring that the component can effectively handle and process these events without getting overwhelmed.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the "maxQueueSizeInBytes" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component, and is it required when configuring this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "maxQueueSizeInBytes" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component is an integer type with a default value of 0. This option specifies the maximum size of the queue in bytes for change events read from the database log but not yet recorded or forwarded. It''s important to note that this feature is disabled by default since its value is set to 0, and it''s an optional configuration when setting up this component within the "db2" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and syntax of the ''messageKeyColumns'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component, including the format for defining tables and key columns, as well as information about whether it has a default value and if its usage is required?'
      answer: |
       'The ''messageKeyColumns'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component serves to define a semicolon-separated list of expressions that specify fully-qualified tables and column(s) to be used as message key. Each expression follows the pattern `(DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME)|(SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME)`, where DB_NAME (database name) or SCHEMA_NAME (schema name) is optional, and the key columns are a comma-separated list of columns representing the custom key.              For any table without an explicit key configuration, the table''s primary key column(s) will be used as message key automatically. An example for ''messageKeyColumns'' configuration would be `dbserver1.inventory.orderlines:orderId,orderLineId;dbserver1.inventory.orders:id`.              The type of ''messageKeyColumns'' is a string, it does not have a default value, and its usage is optional since it is included in the "groups":"db2" configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the option ''notificationEnabledChannels'' in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and is it a required or optional configuration setting? Also, in which group does this option belong?'
      answer: |
       'The ''notificationEnabledChannels'' option within the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component is an optional configuration setting (since it has a default value of null). Its purpose is to list the names of the notification channels that are enabled for notifications. This configuration option belongs to the DB2 group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the "notificationSinkTopicName" option within the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and is it considered a required option when using it with enabled channels that include ''sink''?'
      answer: |
       'The "notificationSinkTopicName" option within the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component serves as the name of the topic for notifications. This option becomes essential if the ''sink'' is included among the enabled channels. However, it''s worth noting that this option is not considered a required one by default as it may have a null value. The purpose of this option is to enable handling and routing of change events emitted by the DB2 source within an Apache Camel route.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "pollIntervalMs" option within the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component, and is it a required configuration parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "pollIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component is 500 milliseconds (ms). Its data type is duration, meaning it accepts values that represent an amount of time. This option determines how long to wait for new change events to appear after receiving no events, and is not a required configuration parameter. It belongs to the DB2 group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''postProcessors'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component, how can its processors be defined, and what type of data does it accept by default? Is the use of this option optional, and if so, which group of configurations does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The ''postProcessors'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component is an optional list that allows you to include post processors. These processors can be defined using a ''.type'' config option and are configured using additional options. By default, this option does not accept any specific data type as it relies on user configuration. Its usage is optional and the ''postProcessors'' group of configurations contains settings related specifically to DB2.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the boolean option "provideTransactionMetadata" in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and is it set to its default value when used in a configuration? Furthermore, what groups does this option belong to?'
      answer: |

    - question: 'What are the possible usage scenarios for the "additionalProperties" option in the Apache Camel''s Debezium-DB2 component, and how should we format property values to be set using this option, given that it is used to configure properties required by the Debezium engine, such as Kafka Connect properties, like setting Kafka Offset Backing Store or Schema Registry URL?'
      answer: |
       'The "additionalProperties" option in the Apache Camel''s Debezium-DB2 component is utilized when you need to configure properties for Debezium that can''t be directly set on Camel configurations. This is particularly useful for setting Kafka Connect properties essential for the Debezium engine, such as the Kafka Offset Backing Store and Schema Registry URL.              To format property values for use with the "additionalProperties" option, you should prefix the property name with "additionalProperties.", followed by the property name itself and its value, separated by an equal sign (=). For example, if you wanted to set the Kafka Offset Backing Store to a specific location or the Schema Registry URL to a particular server, you would format these as follows:       - additionalProperties.transactional.id=12345       - additionalProperties.schema.registry.url=http://localhost:8811/avro              This allows you to customize various Debezium engine settings without modifying the main Camel configuration directly, providing a more flexible and organized approach to configuration management.'

This option specifies the path to the file where the offsets will be stored. If you wish to use this feature, ensure that you provide a valid file path for this configuration.'
    - question: 'How many partitions should I configure for the "offsetStoragePartitions" option in the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component when using the KafkaOffsetBackingStore for offset storage? Is it mandatory to provide a specific number of partitions or can it be left undefined? If I decide to define a number, what data type should it follow and what group does this option belong to in terms of the component''s configuration groups?'
      answer: |
       'When using the "offsetStoragePartitions" option for the Debezium DB2 component in Apache Camel and setting the offset storage to ''KafkaOffsetBackingStore'', you have the choice to configure the number of partitions, but it''s not mandatory. If you decide to define a specific number of partitions, it should follow an integer data type. This option falls under the "consumer" configuration group in terms of the component''s settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "offsetStorageReplicationFactor" option in the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option if offset.storage is set to the KafkaOffsetBackingStore?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageReplicationFactor" option within the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component defines the replication factor used when creating the offset storage topic. It is necessary to specify this value only when you set "offset.storage" to the KafkaOffsetBackingStore. Its default value is null, meaning that if a value is not provided, it will be left at its default (typically determined by your specific Kafka configuration). Therefore, providing a value for "offsetStorageReplicationFactor" is optional when using KafkaOffsetBackingStore as the offset storage.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "offsetStorageTopic" option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and what should its value be when offset.storage is set to KafkaOffsetBackingStore, if not specified by default?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageTopic" option within the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component is intended for specifying the name of a Kafka topic where offset information will be stored. This is necessary when the configuration parameter "offset.storage" is set to KafkaOffsetBackingStore. If not explicitly specified, its value defaults to null, meaning the topic name should be defined elsewhere or will remain unconfigured in that case.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and when is it set to true, how is it handled differently compared to when it''s false, considering the default value is false? Also, under what circumstances might this option be set to true?'
      answer: |
       'The `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component enables bridging the consumer to the routing Error Handler, which means that any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages will be handled as a message by the routing Error Handler instead of being logged and ignored, as is the default behavior.              When `bridgeErrorHandler` is set to true, exception handling becomes more robust because exceptions are converted into Camel messages and processed using the routing Error Handler, providing a more structured way to handle and respond to errors compared to when it''s false. This option is useful when the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. However, not all components support this functionality; some may handle exceptions internally only, making `bridgeErrorHandler` unavailable in such cases.              This option might be set to true during the implementation of advanced error-handling strategies or when requiring a more sophisticated approach for handling errors generated by the debezium-db2 component compared to the default exception logging and ignoring behavior.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom ExceptionHandler for errors occurring during the consumption of data in Apache Camel''s debezium-db2 component, and what is the default behavior if no custom ExceptionHandler is set?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom ExceptionHandler for errors during data consumption using the Apache Camel''s debezium-db2 component, you can do so by setting the "exceptionHandler" option in your consumer configuration. If you wish to use a custom ExceptionHandler, it should be an object that handles exceptions produced during the data consumption process.              However, keep in mind that if the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled, this "exceptionHandler" option will not be in use. By default, when no custom ExceptionHandler is set, the consumer will handle exceptions at a WARN or ERROR level, and these errors will be logged and then ignored. This default behavior can be found under the advanced consumer group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2", and under what configuration group is it considered optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-db2" component determines the messaging pattern when a consumer creates an exchange. By default, this value is null, which means the pattern is determined by other factors such as the component''s behavior or Camel context settings. This option is considered optional and can be found in the advanced "consumer" configuration group of Apache Camel configurations for the debezium-db2 component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `columnExcludeList` option in the Apache Camel `debezium-db2` component and what type of value should it take if it''s to be configured, considering that its default value is null and it is an optional setting?'
      answer: |
       'The `columnExcludeList` option in the Apache Camel `debezium-db2` component allows you to specify regular expressions that match columns to exclude from change events. It takes a string value, and if configured, this optional setting can be used to filter out certain columns from the event data when working with Databases 2 (DB2). If no value is provided for `columnExcludeList`, its default value is null, meaning all columns will be included in the change events.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "columnIncludeList" option for the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "columnIncludeList" option for the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component serves the purpose of defining regular expressions matching columns to include in change events. This option accepts a string value, but has no default value. Whether to use it is optional since setting it to null will not affect its functionality.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, required status, applicable group, and a brief description of the debezium-db2 component option named "columnPropagateSourceType" in Apache Camel?'
      answer: |
       'The "columnPropagateSourceType" option within the "debezium-db2" component in Apache Camel is an optional setting (required: false) that allows you to propagate the original type and length of specific columns from your source database to the emitted change records. This is achieved by providing a comma-separated list of regular expressions that match fully-qualified column names. The default value for this option is null, and it belongs to the "db2" group. In essence, it adds metadata about the original schema columns to the change records generated during database changes events.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and configuration details of the "converters" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-db2" component, and is it optional or required? Also, can you explain how to define custom converters using the ''.type'' config option and configure them with additional options starting with ''.''?'
      answer: |
       'The "converters" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-db2" component is an optional configuration that allows you to use custom converters instead of the default ones. This is particularly useful when working with data types that aren''t handled adequately by the defaults.              To define custom converters, you can utilize the ''.type'' config option. For instance, if you want to use a Jackson converter, you would specify ''org.apache.camel.converter.jaxb.JaxbDataFormat''. Additional options for configuring these custom converters can be set using options starting with a single point (e.g., ''.''), such as setting the format provider class, mapping files, or any other relevant configuration for your chosen converter type.              Remember that these configurations are optional and not mandatory; if left unspecified, Camel will use its default converters.'
    - question: 'What are the possible usage patterns for the "customMetricTags" option within the Apache Camel''s Debezium-DB2 component, and how can you set custom tag values to customize the MBean object name?'
      answer: |
       'The "customMetricTags" option within the Apache Camel''s Debezium-DB2 component allows for customizing the Management Bean (MBean) object name by appending additional information. This is accomplished by using key-value pairs, where each unique key represents a tag associated with the MBean object name and its corresponding value is the assigned label for that specific key.              To illustrate, if you set the tags as ''k1=v1'' and ''k2=v2'', the final MBean object name would be a combination of the regular MBean name and these custom tags, such as "regular_MBean_Name_k1=v1_k2=v2". This mechanism provides flexibility in organizing and identifying MBeans based on specific criteria or characteristics.              You can set custom tag values by specifying them within the option when configuring your Debezium-DB2 component, like so: "customMetricTags=k1=v1,k2=v2". Please note that using this option is optional since a default value is not assigned (defaultValue: null).'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "databaseDbname" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2"? Can this option be specified as a required or optional parameter, and in what data type should it be entered?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseDbname" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2" specifies the name of the database from which the connector should capture changes. Its default value is null, meaning no default value is provided if you don''t specify it during configuration. This option can be either required or optional depending on your use case and setup; however, it is set as optional in its current configuration. The data type for this option is string.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "databaseHostname" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2", and is it a mandatory field to be provided? (Answer: The "databaseHostname" option in the "debezium-db2" component is used to specify the resolvable hostname or IP address of the database server. Its default value is null, meaning it''s not required but can be provided if necessary.)'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseHostname" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2" serves to specify the resolvable hostname or IP address of the database server. Its default value is null, which implies that it''s not mandatory to provide this field. However, you can offer it if desired, within the "db2" group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the mandatory string parameter, required when using the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component in a connection to a database, for specifying the password of the database user?'
      answer: |

    - question: 'What is the optional string type parameter, which can be provided for the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component, that specifies the name of the database user to be used when establishing a connection with the DB2 database?'
      answer: |
       'The optional string-type parameter you''re referring to for the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component is called "databaseUser". This parameter allows you to specify the name of the database user that will be utilized when establishing a connection with the DB2 database. It should be noted that while providing this value is not mandatory, it can be helpful for managing access and security within your DB2 environment.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the debezium-db2 component in Apache Camel to propagate source data types, including original type and original length, to the corresponding fields in emitted change records when this feature is optional and not set by default?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Debezium DB2 component in Apache Camel to propagate source data types, you can specify the "datatypePropagateSourceType" option as a comma-separated list of regular expressions for matching the database-specific data type names. In this setting, the data type''s original type and original length will be added as parameters to the corresponding field schemas in emitted change records. Set this configuration to be optional by leaving its default value null if you wish to use it. When using the DB2 group components, include this option with your configurations where appropriate.'
    - question: 'What are the available options for the `decimalHandlingMode` attribute of the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component, and what does each option mean with regards to how DECIMAL and NUMERIC columns are represented in change events, as well as their default values and groups they belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The `decimalHandlingMode` attribute for the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component offers three options: ''precise'' (default), ''string'', and ''double''.              * ''precise'' (the default) uses java.math.BigDecimal to represent DECIMAL and NUMERIC values, which are encoded in change events using a binary representation and Kafka Connect''s ''org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Decimal'' type, offering high precision but requiring more resources to use.       * ''string'' represents values as strings, providing easier consumption but sacrificing the precision offered by other types.       * ''double'' uses Java''s ''double'' data type to represent the values, which may not offer the same level of precision found in ''precise'' mode but will be much easier to consume.              These options belong to the ''db2'' group and their default value is ''precise''.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible range for the "errorsMaxRetries" option in the Apache Camel''s Debezium DB2 component, and can this setting be considered as an optional configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "errorsMaxRetries" option in the Apache Camel''s Debezium DB2 component is -1, indicating no limit on the number of retries on connection errors. It accepts integer values as input, and this setting can be considered optional since it''s marked as "required: false" in the configuration.'
    - question: 'What are the available options for handling failures during the processing of events in an Apache Camel integration using the Debezium DB2 component, and how does the ''fail'' option differ from ''warn'' and ''ignore'' in terms of dealing with a corrupted event? (Also, please confirm what the default value for this configuration option is.)'
      answer: |
       'In an Apache Camel integration using the Debezium DB2 component, there are three options available for handling failures during the processing of events: ''fail'' (default), ''warn'', and ''ignore''. The ''fail'' option, when a corrupted event is encountered, raises an exception indicating the problematic event and its position. This causes the connector to stop and the rest of the processing will be halted until it is resolved. In contrast, the ''warn'' option logs the details of the corrupted event and skips it, without stopping the connector. Lastly, the ''ignore'' option skips the problematic event altogether, without logging or raising any exception, allowing the rest of the processing to continue uninterrupted. The default value for this configuration option is ''fail''.'

    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component''s includeSchemaChanges option affect the behavior when using a Kafka topic, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "includeSchemaChanges" option for the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component determines whether the connector will publish database schema changes to a Kafka topic with the same name as the database server ID. If this option is set to ''true'' (the default value), each schema change will be recorded using a key containing the database name and a logical description of the new schema, along with the optional DDL statements. This occurs regardless of how the connector internally maintains its own database schema history record. Setting this option to false means the connector will not publish such schema changes to the specified Kafka topic.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible data type of the "incrementalSnapshotChunkSize" option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and is it a required configuration parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The "incrementalSnapshotChunkSize" option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component is an integer data type that specifies the maximum size of chunk (number of documents/rows) for incremental snapshotting. Its default value is 1024, and it''s not a required configuration parameter.'

      answer: |
       'The `incrementalSnapshotWatermarkingStrategy` option within the "debezium-db2" component in Apache Camel has two possible values: ''INSERT_INSERT'' (default) and ''INSERT_DELETE''. The ''INSERT_INSERT'' strategy writes both open and close signals into the signal data collection, while ''INSERT_DELETE'' only writes the open signal on the signal data collection with the close signal being set to delete the relative open signal later. This option is optional and can be found under the "db2" group.'
    - question: 'What is the default maximum size of a batch of source records when using the "maxBatchSize" option with the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component, and how can this value be configured if it''s desired to change it from its default?'
      answer: |
       'When working with the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component, the maximum size of a batch of source records is set to 2048 by default, as specified by the "maxBatchSize" option. If you wish to change this value from its default setting, it can be easily configured within your setup. Keep in mind that this value should be defined as an integer. For instance, if you desire a maximum batch size of 1024 instead, you could set the maxBatchSize parameter to 1024 in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the maxQueueSize option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component and what purpose does this option serve when configuring it? Additionally, in what scenarios should the use of maxQueueSize be adjusted compared to the default setting?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "maxQueueSize" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component is 8192. This option defines the maximum size of the queue for change events read from the database log but not yet recorded or forwarded. It should always be larger than the maximum batch size. Adjusting the use of maxQueueSize compared to the default setting might be necessary in scenarios where a large volume of change events are being generated and need to be processed more rapidly, thus requiring a higher queue size. Conversely, when dealing with a smaller volume of events or limited system resources, reducing the maxQueueSize could help prevent memory overload and improve performance.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type, as well as whether it''s required or optional, for the maxQueueSizeInBytes option in the debezium-db2 component of Apache Camel, and can you explain its functionality?'

This option represents the maximum size of the queue in bytes for change events read from the DB2 database log but not yet recorded or forwarded. If set to 0 (the default), this feature is not enabled, meaning that there is no limit on the size of the event queue. The `maxQueueSizeInBytes` option can be specified as part of the configuration for the debezium-db2 component and is optional, not required.'
    - question: 'What is the format and purpose of the "messageKeyColumns" option when using the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and how does it differ from the default behavior for tables without an explicit key configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "messageKeyColumns" option, when working with the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component, is a semicolon-separated list that specifies expressions used to identify fully-qualified tables and columns as message keys in event messages. These expressions can include both the database name and table name (e.g., `dbserver1.inventory.orderlines:orderId,orderLineId`), or just the schema and table names if preferred (e.g., `inventory.orderlines:orderId,orderLineId`). The custom key is a comma-separated list of columns chosen for use as the message key.              For tables without explicit key configuration, Debezium will automatically utilize the primary key column(s) as the message key by default. This means that you can leverage the "messageKeyColumns" option to explicitly specify non-primary key columns for selected tables, allowing for customization of the message keys according to your specific needs.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the option "notificationEnabledChannels" in the Apache Camel''s debezium-db2 component, and is it required or optional?

      answer: |
       'The option "notificationEnabledChannels" in the Apache Camel''s Debezium-DB2 component is an optional setting with a default value of null. Its purpose is to list the names of notification channels that are enabled for notifications. These channels serve as destinations where the change events from the DB2 database will be sent. Enabling and configuring notification channels can provide a way to route or process these events outside the integration flow, such as sending alerts, performing data analysis, or triggering additional actions based on the change events. Common use cases include setting up alerts for specific data modifications, routing data changes to downstream systems for further processing, or aggregating and summarizing change events before they are processed further.'
    - question: 'What should be the value of the "notificationSinkTopicName" option in an Apache Camel route that uses the debezium-db2 component, if you want to enable notifications and the sink channel is included in the list of enabled channels? Is there a default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'To enable notifications with the ''sink'' channel in your Apache Camel route using the debezium-db2 component, you should provide a valid string value for the "notificationSinkTopicName" option. If no specific value is specified, it does not have a default value. So, you need to set this value accordingly, based on your Kafka topic naming conventions, before running your Camel route.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible data type for the "pollIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel''s Debezium-DB2 component, and is it required for the operation of this component?

    - question: 'What are the available values for the `schemaNameAdjustmentMode` option in the Apache Camel `debezium-db2` component, and how do each of these settings affect the schema name adjustments for compatibility with the message converter used by the connector?'
      answer: |
       'The `schemaNameAdjustmentMode` option within the Apache Camel `debezium-db2` component offers three different values: ''avro'', ''avro_unicode'', and ''none'' (default).              - ''avro'': This mode replaces any characters that cannot be used in an Avro type name with underscores (_). It helps ensure compatibility with the Avro message converter.              - ''avro_unicode'': In this mode, instead of replacing underscore or problematic characters with simple underscores, it uses corresponding Unicode sequences like _uxxxx. This method may be helpful in specific situations where using a simple underscore might not suffice due to character limitations or other factors.              - ''none'': With the ''none'' option, no schema name adjustment is performed by default. In such cases, it''s assumed that the schema names are already compatible with the Avro message converter, and no additional modifications will be made.              Each of these settings affects the adjustments to the schema names for compatibility with the message converter used by the connector. By selecting an appropriate setting, you can ensure smooth data transformation from the DB2 source into your chosen format (such as Avro) when using the `debezium-db2` component in Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What should be the value of the "signalDataCollection" option in Apache Camel''s debezium-db2 component when you want to enable sending signals or commands to Debezium? If left unspecified, is it considered disabled?'
      answer: |
       'To enable sending signals or commands to Debezium using the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, you should specify a non-null string value for the "signalDataCollection" option. Leaving this option unspecified will result in signaling being considered disabled.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "signalEnabledChannels" option within the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2", and what is its default value if no custom value is specified, as well as whether its usage is optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "signalEnabledChannels" option within the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2" serves to list the names of channels that are enabled for communication. By default, the source channel is enabled, but you can customize this list if needed. This setting allows you to select specific channels for your data transfer from the DB2 database. Its usage is optional; if no custom value is specified, the source channel will be activated by default.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "signalPollIntervalMs" option within the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and is it a required or optional configuration setting? Additionally, could you explain what this option does in the context of using this component with DB2 databases?'
      answer: |
       'The "signalPollIntervalMs" option within the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component is an optional configuration setting with a default value of 5 seconds, represented as a duration type. This option controls the interval for looking for new signals in registered channels in milliseconds. When using this component with DB2 databases, it essentially determines how frequently Debezium checks the database for changes to be synced.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and valid values of the ''skippedOperations'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, if it is set to its default value and not specified? How can it be customized to skip certain operations such as insert, update, or delete during streaming?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the ''skippedOperations'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component is to skip only truncate operations. If not specified, this is its default value (''t''). To customize it and skip specific operations such as insert, update, or delete during streaming, you can set the option to a comma-separated list of appropriate characters. For instance, to skip inserts, updates, and truncates (leaving only deletes), you would use ''d''. If you want to skip all operations and stream nothing, set it to ''none''. Valid characters for defining the list are: ''c'' (inserts/create), ''u'' (updates), ''d'' (deletes), ''t'' (truncates) or ''none''.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "snapshotDelayMs" option for the Apache Camel''s debezium-db2 component, and can it be configured without being required?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "snapshotDelayMs" option in Apache Camel''s debezium-db2 component is 0 ms (zero milliseconds). The data type of this option is "duration". It is not a required configuration, meaning you can configure it if desired but it will function without being explicitly set.'

      answer: |
       'The "snapshotIncludeCollectionList" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component is intended to specify a list of tables/collections whose snapshot should be taken upon creating or restarting the connector. By default, it does not have a value, which means that all tables/collections will be included if no list is specified. This option is optional; you can use it to restrict the initial snapshot and the snapshots taken on connector restarts.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and description of the "snapshotLockTimeoutMs" option for the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component, and what data type and is it mandatory or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "snapshotLockTimeoutMs" option for the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component is a duration type setting. Its default value is 10 seconds, which means the maximum number of milliseconds to wait for table locks at the beginning of a snapshot. If table locks cannot be acquired within this time frame, the snapshot will be aborted. This option is optional and falls under the "db2" groups.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the option ''snapshotMode'' in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-db2'', and what are the valid options for this configuration parameter, as well as when its usage may not be required?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the ''snapshotMode'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-db2'' is set to ''initial''. This means that the connector will only run a snapshot upon startup if no offsets are available for the logical server name. The alternative valid option is ''schema_only'', which specifies that the connector should run a snapshot of the schema only when no offsets are available. However, usage of this parameter may not be required as its purpose is to control when a snapshot is initiated during startup; if you wish to have a snapshot run at every startup, you can skip this setting since it is optional.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotData'' option within the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and is it required for use when configuring a db2 data source?'
      answer: |
       'The ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotData'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component determines whether a snapshot should be taken of your DB2 data based on a configuration setting. Specifically, when you set the ''snapshot.mode'' to "configuration_based", this option permits you to control the timing of when the snapshot is taken. Its default value is false, meaning that a snapshot will not be taken initially unless manually specified elsewhere in your configuration. This option is optional and can be used or skipped during the setup of a DB2 data source within your Camel configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the debezium-db2 option called snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnDataError when using configuration_based snapshot mode, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option during component configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnDataError'' option in the debezium-db2 component allows you to configure whether or not a snapshot should be taken when an error occurs, when using configuration-based snapshot mode (i.e., when ''snapshot.mode'' is set as "configuration_based"). The default value of this boolean setting is false, meaning that no snapshot will be taken in the event of an error if nothing is provided during configuration. However, it is not mandatory to provide a value for this option; if left unspecified, the default behavior will apply.'
    - question: 'Given the provided information about the Apache Camel component `debezium-db2` and its option `snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnSchemaError`, I can construct the following question:              "What is the default value, whether true or false, of the `snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnSchemaError` option when using the debezium-db2 component in Apache Camel, and under which circumstances (if it''s not the default) can the schema be snapshot if an error occurs during a configuration-based snapshot mode?"'

       'The Apache Camel debezium-db2 option named "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedStartStream" enables you to configure whether a Kafka stream should start or not after a snapshot, when ''snapshot.mode'' is set as configuration_based. By default, this option is set to false. Although it''s not required for configuration, it can be found under the "db2" group.'
    - question: 'How should I configure the `snapshotModeCustomName` option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component when using a custom implementation of the ''Snapshotter'' interface, and is it mandatory to set this option during configuration?'
      answer: |
       'To use a custom implementation of the ''Snapshotter'' interface with the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component, you should configure the `snapshotModeCustomName` option by specifying the name of your custom implementation. This should be done when ''snapshot.mode'' is set as "custom". Note that while it isn''t mandatory to set this option during configuration for other modes, if you choose "custom", it becomes essential to provide a custom implementation name. The implementations must have the ability to implement the ''Snapshotter'' interface and will be called on each app boot to determine whether to execute a snapshot.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component''s "snapshotTablesOrderByRowCount" option to order table processing in the initial snapshot based on their descending row counts?'
      answer: |
       'To order table processing in the initial snapshot by their descending row counts using the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component, you should set the "snapshotTablesOrderByRowCount" option to the string value "descending". If you wish to order them ascending, set the option to "ascending", and if you prefer to disable ordering based on row count, leave it as its default value "disabled".'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the `sourceinfoStructMaker` option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component, and is it mandatory to provide a custom implementation if I don''t want to modify the SourceInfo schema and struct?'

      answer: |
       'The "tableExcludeList" option in the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component is designed to allow you to specify a comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of tables to be excluded from monitoring. By default, it doesn''t have any value (defaultValue: null). The use of this option is optional; it can be included or left out as per your requirements within the "db2" group.'
    - question: 'In the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component, what is the default behavior for the "tableIgnoreBuiltin" option and can it be disabled if necessary?'
      answer: |
       'The "tableIgnoreBuiltin" option in the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component is set to true by default, which means that built-in tables will be ignored during data change capture events. If you need to monitor built-in tables instead, you can disable this behavior as it''s an optional setting (since the "required" field is false). This can be done by setting the option''s value to false when configuring your Debezium connector for DB2.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "tableIncludeList" option within the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and can it be left as null or does it require a specific string value for configuring which DB2 tables changes will be captured?'
      answer: |
       'The "tableIncludeList" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component is used to specify the tables for whose changes you wish to capture. This parameter is optional, meaning it can have a null value. However, if you want to configure which DB2 tables changes will be captured, you need to provide it with a specific string value or list of strings, specifying the names of the tables you''re interested in.'
    - question: 'What are the available options for the ''timePrecisionMode'' configuration in the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component, along with their descriptions and how they differ from the default setting of ''adaptive'', and is it mandatory to set a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The ''timePrecisionMode'' configuration option within the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component offers three distinct settings: ''adaptive'' (default), ''adaptive_time_microseconds'', and ''connect''. In the ''adaptive'' mode, time, date, and timestamp values are based on the precision of the respective database column.              The ''adaptive_time_microseconds'' mode is similar to the adaptive setting but with an additional constraint; TIME fields in this case will always utilize microseconds precision.              Lastly, the ''connect'' setting guarantees that time, date, and timestamp values are represented using Kafka Connect''s built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which employ millisecond precision irrespective of the database columns'' precision.              It is not mandatory to provide a value for this option as the default setting of ''adaptive'' will be used if no value is specified.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "tombstonesOnDelete" option in the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component and can it be configured to emit a tombstone event for a delete operation, enabling Kafka to completely remove all events related to the given key if the source record is deleted?'

       'The default value for the "tombstonesOnDelete" option in the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component is false. However, it can be configured to emit a tombstone event for a delete operation. When set to true, Kafka will completely remove all events related to the given key if the source record is deleted.'
    - question: 'What is the default TopicNamingStrategy class used by the debezium-db2 component in Apache Camel when specifying the topic name for data change, schema change, transaction, heartbeat events, and is its usage optional within this component group? Additionally, what type should this option be set as and what are the valid string values it can take if a custom TopicNamingStrategy class is specified?'
      answer: |
       'The default TopicNamingStrategy class used by the debezium-db2 component in Apache Camel for determining the topic name for data change, schema change, transaction, heartbeat events is io.debezium.schema.SchemaTopicNamingStrategy. Its usage within the "db2" component group is optional, as indicated by the "required: false". Regarding the type of this option, it should be set as a string, and if a custom TopicNamingStrategy class is specified, the valid string values would depend on the specific implementation of that class.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `topicPrefix` option in the Apache Camel `debezium-db2` component, what characters are allowed, what is its default value, is it a required option, and which groups does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The `topicPrefix` option in the Apache Camel `debezium-db2` component serves as an identifier for the particular database server/cluster that it is capturing changes from. This prefix should be unique across all other connectors because it is used as a prefix for all Kafka topic names receiving events emitted by this connector. The allowed characters include alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-), dots (.), and underscores (_). Its default value is null, meaning it must be specified during configuration, and it belongs to the ''db2'' groups since it is specific to DB2 database systems.'
