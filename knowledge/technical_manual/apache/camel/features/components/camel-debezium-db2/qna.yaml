    - question: 'What are the valid uses of the "additionalProperties" option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and how should properties within this option be formatted to configure Kafka Connect properties necessary for the Debezium engine, such as setting a Kafka offset backing store or schema registry URL?'
      answer: |
       'The "additionalProperties" option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component is utilized when direct configuration on the Camel settings isn''t possible. This includes setting Kafka Connect properties that are essential for the Debezium engine, like configuring a Kafka Offset Backing Store or Schema Registry URL. To configure these settings using "additionalProperties", you should format them as follows:              1. Prefix each property with "additionalProperties." (e.g., additionalProperties.transactional.id=12345, additionalProperties.schema.registry.url=http://localhost:8811/avro)       2. Include the key and value for the desired Kafka Connect property in the prefix format.              For instance, to set a Kafka Offset Backing Store or Schema Registry URL using "additionalProperties", you would construct your configuration like this:              ```       debezium-db2{          ...          additionalProperties.transactional.id=12345          additionalProperties.schema.registry.url=http://localhost:8811/avro          ...       }       ```'
    - question: 'How does the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component work, and when is it not possible to use this option? Also, what is the default behavior if the bridgeErrorHandler is not used?'
      answer: |
       'The ''bridgeErrorHandler'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component enables bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions encountered while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages will be processed as a message and managed by the routing Error Handler. However, it''s important to note that this functionality is dependent on whether the third-party component allows Camel to be notified if an exception was thrown. If the component handles exceptions internally only, the bridgeErrorHandler cannot be used. In such cases, we may work towards improving the Camel component to interact with the third-party component and make this feature available in future releases. By default, when the bridgeErrorHandler is not utilized, the consumer will employ the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler, logging exceptions at WARN or ERROR level and ignoring them.'
    - question: 'What are the possible configurations that can be set for the Debezium DB2 component in Apache Camel when using it as a consumer, and is their usage optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'For the Debezium DB2 component in Apache Camel used as a consumer, you have the option to set pre-configured configurations, although their usage is not required. The specific configuration details can be provided as an object type. No default value is specified for these configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "internalKeyConverter" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2", and what class should be used as its default value if not explicitly set, according to the provided documentation?'
      answer: |
       'The "internalKeyConverter" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2" is used to specify a Converter class for serializing and deserializing key data associated with offsets. In case no explicit value is set, the default converter utilized is the org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter as mentioned in the provided documentation.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "internalValueConverter" option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and what is its default value if not explicitly specified? Additionally, is the use of this option optional or required when configuring the debezium-db2 component?'
      answer: |
       'The "internalValueConverter" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component is used to specify a class for serializing and deserializing value data related to offsets. By default, this option uses an JSON converter (org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter). Its use is optional within the configuration of the debezium-db2 component as noted by the "required": false property in the information provided.'
    - question: 'What are the valid options for the `offsetCommitPolicy` option in the Apache Camel component `debezium-db2`, and how does it determine when to trigger an offset commit? Also, is it mandatory to provide a value for this option, and if so, what type of value should it be?'
      answer: |
       'The `offsetCommitPolicy` option in the Apache Camel component `debezium-db2` accepts a string value representing the name of the Java class that defines the commit policy for offset commits. This class must implement the ''OffsetCommitPolicy'' interface, which determines when to trigger an offset commit based on the number of events processed and/or the time elapsed since the last commit. The default value is a periodic commit policy based upon time intervals. Providing a value for this option is not mandatory, but if you choose to do so, it should be a valid Java class name conforming to the specified interface.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum duration, in milliseconds, that the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component will wait for records to be flushed and offset data committed before it cancels a process and retries commitment at a later time, if the ''offsetCommitTimeoutMs'' option is not specified (i.e., its default value is used)? And what is the unit of measurement for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The maximum duration that the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component will wait for records to be flushed and offset data committed before it cancels a process and retries commitment at a later time, if the ''offsetCommitTimeoutMs'' option is not specified (i.e., its default value is used), is 5000 milliseconds. The unit of measurement for this option is duration in milliseconds.'
    - question: 'What is the default interval (in milliseconds) for the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component''s offsetFlushIntervalMs option, and what is this option used for in the consumer group?'
      answer: |
       'The default interval for the offsetFlushIntervalMs option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component is 60000 milliseconds (1 minute). This option determines the frequency at which the component will attempt to commit offsets. In other words, it decides how often the position of the data stream consumer group is recorded and saved. When not set explicitly, it defaults to 1 minute.'
    - question: 'What is the default Java class responsible for persisting Debezium DB2 connector offsets in Apache Camel, and is it possible to change this class if needed?'
      answer: |
       'The default Java class responsible for persisting Debezium DB2 connector offsets in Apache Camel is org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.FileOffsetBackingStore. If you need to change this class, it''s possible as the ''offsetStorage'' option accepts a string type value, and it''s marked as an optional configuration under the "consumer" group.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and required status of the "offsetStorageFileName" option in the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component, and what should its value be if I want to use the FileOffsetBackingStore for offset storage?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageFileName" option in the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component has a default value of null and is not required. However, if you wish to use the FileOffsetBackingStore for offset storage, you should specify a string value for this option indicating the path to the file where offsets will be stored.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "offsetStoragePartitions" option in the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component, and is it required when using this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStoragePartitions" option in the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component serves to define the number of partitions used when creating the offset storage topic. This is necessary only when the ''KafkaOffsetBackingStore'' is set as the offset storage. By default, it does not have a value assigned (defaultValue: null). Whether or not you need to specify this option depends on your usage scenario; it''s not required but can be used for managing distributed offsets efficiently in a Kafka environment when using consumer groups.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "offsetStorageReplicationFactor" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component, and is it required when setting offset.storage to the KafkaOffsetBackingStore?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageReplicationFactor" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component determines the replication factor used when creating the offset storage topic. This option is necessary when you set "offset.storage" to the KafkaOffsetBackingStore. However, it''s important to note that its default value is null, meaning if no value is explicitly provided, Camel will not enforce any specific replication factor. The group this option belongs to is "consumer".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "offsetStorageTopic" option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageTopic" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component is used to specify the name of a Kafka topic where offsets will be stored. This is relevant when the `offset.storage` setting is set to the KafkaOffsetBackingStore. The default value for this option is null, meaning no default topic is set. Whether it is required or optional depends on your specific usage; while it''s not strictly required, using a topic for offset storage can help ensure consistency and resilience in distributed systems. This option falls under the ''consumer'' group within the component configuration settings.'
    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the autowiredEnabled option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component affect its behavior regarding automatic configuration of data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, and so on? Moreover, what is the default value for this option and can it be used even if not required?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component allows for automatic configuration of data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, and similar components. When this option is set to true, Camel will search the registry for a single instance of matching type, and configure it on the component if found. This feature can be beneficial in scenarios where you want to automatically manage your connections or clients without explicit configuration. The default value for this option is true, meaning that autowiring is enabled by default. However, you can choose to disable it (by setting false) if you prefer to explicitly configure these components. It''s worth noting that even though the "autowiredEnabled" option falls under the "advanced" group, it can still be used, regardless of whether it''s required in your specific use case.'
    - question: 'What is the default schema for the location of Change Data Capture (CDC) change tables in Apache Camel''s debezium-db2 component when the ''cdcChangeTablesSchema'' option is not specified during configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The default schema for the location of Change Data Capture (CDC) change tables in Apache Camel''s debezium-db2 component is ''ASNCDC'' when the ''cdcChangeTablesSchema'' option is not specified during configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the option "cdcControlSchema" in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2", and is it required when using this component? Also, can you explain what purpose does this option serve within the context of the DB2 database?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the option "cdcControlSchema" in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2" is "ASNCDC". This option specifies the schema where Change Data Capture (CDC) control structures are located, and it defaults to ''ASNCDC''. The data type of this option is "string", and it''s not mandatory to provide a value as it has a default. When using the "debezium-db2" component with a DB2 database, this option serves the purpose of defining the schema that contains the CDC control structures, which are essential for capturing changes in the database tables.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, required status, and group association of the "columnExcludeList" option in the Apache Camel''s debezium-db2 component, and can it accept regular expressions to exclude certain columns from change events?'
      answer: |
       'The "columnExcludeList" option in Apache Camel''s debezium-db2 component is a user-defined configuration that accepts regular expressions for matching columns to exclude from change events. Its default value is null, meaning no columns are excluded by default. It is of type string and the requirement for its use is optional. The group associated with this option is "db2".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it''s required for the ''columnIncludeList'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and under what group does this option belong?'
      answer: |
       'The ''columnIncludeList'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component is a string type configuration that allows you to specify regular expressions matching columns to include in change events. Its default value is null, meaning all columns will be included if not explicitly specified. This option is not required, as all columns are included by default. The group this option belongs to is ''db2''.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the debezium-db2 component in Apache Camel to include the original column data types and lengths in the emitted change records, using regular expressions for column selection?'
      answer: |
       'To include the original column data types and lengths in the emitted change records of the debezium-db2 component in Apache Camel using regular expressions for column selection, you can configure the "columnPropagateSourceType" option. Set it to a comma-separated list of regular expressions matching fully-qualified names of columns. For example:              ```       debezium-db2: {         columnPropagateSourceType: ''columnNameRegex1,columnNameRegex2''       }       ```              In this way, the original column types and lengths will be added as parameters to the corresponding field schemas in the emitted change records. Please note that specifying this option is optional, and its default value is null if not provided. You can find more details about groups within the db2 group when you explore Apache Camel''s debezium-db2 component documentation.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "converters" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component, how can it be configured, what is its default value, and under which group of options does it fall?'
      answer: |
       'The "converters" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component is an optional configuration that allows you to use custom converters instead of the default ones. You can define these custom converters using the ''.type'' config option and configure them using other options prefixed with a dot. By default, it has no value (defaultValue: null). This option falls under the "db2" group of configurations.'
    - question: 'How can I configure custom metric tags for the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component to set specific keys and values that will be appended to the regular MBean object name?'
      answer: |
       'To configure custom metric tags for the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component, you can append key-value pairs to the regular MBean object name. Each key represents a tag for the MBean object name, and the corresponding value would be the value of that tag the key is. For example: `k1=v1,k2=v2`. This feature is optional, and you can set it using the "customMetricTags" option in your component configuration. Please note that this option accepts a string format for the tags. If you don''t provide any custom metric tags, no additional information will be appended to the regular MBean object name.'
    - question: 'What is the optional string parameter `databaseDbname` used for in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2", and what is its default value, if any, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The `databaseDbname` parameter in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2" is an optional string that specifies the name of the database from which the Debezium connector should capture changes. Its default value is null, meaning you must provide a specific database name if you wish to use this feature. However, it''s important to note that its usage is not mandatory when employing the "debezium-db2" component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, required status, and group association of the "databaseHostname" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-db2" component, if it''s not required?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseHostname" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-db2" component is a string type that represents the resolvable hostname or IP address of the database server. It is not required, meaning you can use this component without providing a value for it. If not provided, it has no default value. The group association for this option is "db2".'
    - question: 'What is the required string input, which specifies the password for the database user when connecting to a DB2 database using the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and if no value is provided, what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The required string input when connecting to a DB2 database using the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component is "databasePassword". This input specifies the password for the database user. If no value is provided for this option, it has a null default value.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type, as well as whether it is required for the "databasePort" option in the Apache Camel''s "debezium-db2" component if a user does not provide a custom port number for their DB2 database server connection?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "databasePort" option in the Apache Camel''s "debezium-db2" component is 50000, and its data type is integer. This option specifies the port of the DB2 database server, but it is not required, meaning you can provide a custom port number if needed. However, if no custom value is provided, it will default to port 50000.'
    - question: 'What is the optional string parameter in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, which specifies the name of the database user to use when connecting to the DB2 database?'
      answer: |
       'The "debezium-db2" component in Apache Camel has an optional string parameter named "databaseUser". This parameter is used to specify the name of the database user to be utilized when establishing a connection to the DB2 database. If no value is provided, it will not be set by default.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the "datatypePropagateSourceType" option within the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2", and what is its purpose if it is not required, and when might this option be useful in the context of DB2 database?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the "datatypePropagateSourceType" option within the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2", you can set it as a property with a comma-separated list of regular expressions matching your DB2-specific data type names. This option allows adding the original data type''s name and length as parameters to the corresponding field schemas in the emitted change records, even if the option is not required.              When working with the DB2 database, this option can be useful when you need to maintain information about the original data types and lengths of values in the emitted change records for better compatibility or traceability purposes. For instance, if you are migrating data from a DB2 table into another system that requires this information, using "datatypePropagateSourceType" would allow you to propagate the required metadata alongside the data being synchronized.'
    - question: 'What different Db2 implementation platform options can be specified for the db2Platform option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2", and what is the default value if this option is not provided?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel component "debezium-db2" offers an option called "db2Platform". This option allows you to specify which Db2 implementation platform the connector is connected to. By default, if no value is provided, it assumes ''LUW'', which represents Windows, UNIX, Linux. However, if you want to use Db2 for z/OS specific SQL statements, you can set this option to ''Z''.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the `decimalHandlingMode` option for the Apache Camel `debezium-db2` component to represent DECIMAL and NUMERIC columns as strings instead of Java''s `BigDecimal` in change events, and what is the default value when this option is not specified?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the `decimalHandlingMode` option for the Apache Camel `debezium-db2` component to represent DECIMAL and NUMERIC columns as strings in change events, you should set its value to ''string''. This is one of the available options which also includes ''precise'' (the default) that uses Java''s BigDecimal and ''double''. If this option is not specified, it defaults to ''precise''. This means that the values will be encoded in the change events using a binary representation and Kafka Connect''s ''org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Decimal'' type. However, setting it to ''string'' will use strings to represent the values, which may be easier for some consumers to handle.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible range for the "errorsMaxRetries" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2", and is it necessary to set a value for this option if no limit on retries is desired?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "errorsMaxRetries" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2" is -1, meaning there is no limit on retries for connection errors. If you wish to disable retries, you can set it to 0. However, if no limit on retries is desired, you do not need to set a value for this option as the default value already caters to that requirement.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the `eventProcessingFailureHandlingMode` option in the Apache Camel component `debezium-db2`, and what are the alternative values to indicate how failures during processing of events should be handled?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `eventProcessingFailureHandlingMode` option in the Apache Camel component `debezium-db2` is ''fail''. When encountering a corrupted event, this mode will raise an exception indicating the problematic event and its position, causing the connector to be stopped. Alternative values include ''warn'', where the problematic event and its position will be logged and skipped, and ''ignore'', where the problematic event will simply be skipped without any logging or error propagation.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "heartbeatIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and when is it considered enabled?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "heartbeatIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component is 0ms, indicating that heartbeat messages are disabled by default. This option determines the length of an interval in milliseconds within which the connector periodically sends heartbeat messages to a specified heartbeat topic. When you set a positive value for this option, it enables heartbeat messages to be sent at the specified interval.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible data type for the "heartbeatTopicsPrefix" option in the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component, and is it required to be set?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "heartbeatTopicsPrefix" option in the Apache Camel Debezium DB2 component is "__debezium-heartbeat". This option specifies the prefix that is used to name heartbeat topics, and it is of type string. Setting this value is optional.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and when is it appropriate to set the debezium-db2 component''s "includeSchemaChanges" option to false within an Apache Camel route, considering that this option controls whether the connector publishes changes in the database schema to a Kafka topic and its default value is true?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "debezium-db2" component''s "includeSchemaChanges" option is set to true, meaning that it will publish changes in your database schema to a Kafka topic with the same name as your database server ID. This option is useful when you want to track and consume these schema changes within your Apache Camel route.              However, setting this option to false might be appropriate if you don''t need or prefer not to have schema changes published to Kafka topics. For instance, in scenarios where your primary focus is on capturing and processing data changes from the database instead of schema changes. Always ensure that changing this option aligns with your specific use case and requirements within your Camel route.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type, as well as whether it''s required or not, for the option "incrementalSnapshotChunkSize" in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component, and what group does this option belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The option "incrementalSnapshotChunkSize" in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component has a default value of 1024 (integer type). It is not required, meaning you can choose whether or not to set it. This option belongs to the "db2" group.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `incrementalSnapshotWatermarkingStrategy` option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component to ''insert_delete'' affect the write and delete operations during an incremental snapshot compared to using the default value ''insert_insert''?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `incrementalSnapshotWatermarkingStrategy` option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component to ''insert_delete'' affects the write and delete operations during an incremental snapshot by only writing the open signal on the signal data collection, with the close operation deleting the relative open signal. This is different from the default value ''insert_insert'', where both the open and close signals are written into the signal data collection.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the maxBatchSize option in the Apache Camel''s debezium-db2 component and can it be set differently if required?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `maxBatchSize` option in Apache Camel''s Debezium DB2 component is 2048. If you need to change this, it can be done as it is an optional setting. The `maxBatchSize` determines the maximum size of each batch of source records from the DB2 database, and you can adjust it according to your specific requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the maxQueueSize option in Apache Camel''s debezium-db2 component and when should this value be adjusted higher than its default, considering the maximum batch size?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `maxQueueSize` option in Apache Camel''s `debezium-db2` component is 8192. This option represents the maximum size of the queue for change events read from the database log but not yet recorded or forwarded. It''s essential to ensure that this value is always larger than your maximum batch size, as the change events waiting to be processed will accumulate in the queue if it''s full. Adjusting `maxQueueSize` higher than its default would be necessary when dealing with high event volumes or when using large batch sizes to optimize throughput, to avoid the queue becoming full and causing delays in data processing.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the maxQueueSizeInBytes option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and is it required when configuring this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `maxQueueSizeInBytes` option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component is an integer type with a default value of 0. This option determines the maximum size of the queue in bytes for change events read from the database log but not yet recorded or forwarded. It is worth noting that this feature is not enabled by default, as indicated by the zero (0) value. Additionally, it''s important to mention that configuring this option is not mandatory, as it has a "required: false" setting within the configuration groups for the DB2 database.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and syntax of the ''messageKeyColumns'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and can it be set to use a specific comma-separated list of columns as custom message keys for certain tables, while still using the primary key column(s) if no explicit key configuration is provided?'
      answer: |
       'The ''messageKeyColumns'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component allows you to specify a semicolon-separated list of expressions for chosen tables and their corresponding columns to be used as message keys. Each expression follows the pattern `(DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME)` or `(SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME)`, depending on the connector, and includes a comma-separated list of key columns representing your custom key.              For tables without an explicit key configuration, the table''s primary key column(s) will be automatically used as message keys. You can provide a specific comma-separated list of columns for certain tables by setting ''messageKeyColumns''. For example: `dbserver1.inventory.orderlines:orderId,orderLineId;dbserver1.inventory.orders:id`. This configuration instructs the Debezium-DB2 component to use ''orderId'' and ''orderLineId'' as custom message keys for the ''orderlines'' table, while using the primary key column(s) for other tables if no explicit key configuration is provided.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "notificationEnabledChannels" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2", and is it required for configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "notificationEnabledChannels" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2" serves to list the names of notification channels that are enabled. Its default value is null, meaning no notification channels are enabled by default. This option is not required for configuration, as indicated by its "required": false property. It falls under the "db2" group of settings.'
    - question: 'What should be the value for the option "notificationSinkTopicName" in an Apache Camel route using Debezium-DB2 component, when the ''sink'' channel is among the enabled ones and no default value has been specified?'
      answer: |
       'In an Apache Camel route utilizing the Debezium-DB2 component with the ''sink'' channel enabled, the option "notificationSinkTopicName" should be provided a string value for the topic name of the notifications. Since no default value has been specified, you will need to assign this value according to your Kafka topic naming convention to effectively handle the generated DB2 change events.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the pollIntervalMs option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component, and is it a required configuration setting?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `pollIntervalMs` option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component is `500ms`, and its data type is "duration". It''s not a required configuration setting, as indicated by the `required: false`.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, type, and required status of the "postProcessors" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2", and can you explain how these post processors are defined and configured?'
      answer: |
       'The "postProcessors" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2" is an optional list where you can define post processors to be applied after data has been extracted from a DB2 database using Debezium connector. Each processor is defined by its type, specified via the ''.type'' config option, and configured using relevant options.

      answer: |
       'The ''timePrecisionMode'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component can take three values: ''adaptive'', ''adaptive_time_microseconds'', and ''connect''. The default value is ''adaptive''.              The ''adaptive'' mode bases the precision of time, date, and timestamp values on the database column''s precision. This means that the precision will dynamically adjust based on the specific column''s settings in the database.              The ''adaptive_time_microseconds'' mode is similar to the ''adaptive'' mode, but it ensures that TIME fields always use microseconds precision instead of the default precision defined by the database column.              Lastly, the ''connect'' mode represents time, date, and timestamp values using Kafka Connect''s built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp. This uses millisecond precision regardless of the database columns'' precision.              Each value serves to control how time, date, and timestamp data is handled and represented during data transfer between the DB2 database and Kafka.'

      answer: |
       'The default duration for the optional configuration parameter "offsetFlushIntervalMs" in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component is 60000 milliseconds (1 minute). This parameter determines the interval at which offset commits are attempted. While the default value is suitable for many use cases, a user might choose to adjust this setting based on specific requirements. For instance, if real-time data processing is essential and there''s a high volume of changes in the database, a user could decrease the interval to ensure that committed offsets are more frequent. Conversely, if the change rate is low or if the application can tolerate some latency, increasing this interval may help reduce resource usage and improve performance.'

    - question: 'How does configuring the "bridgeErrorHandler" option within the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component affect the handling of exceptions that may occur during message consumption, and under what circumstances is it possible to enable this feature?'
      answer: |
       'Configuring the "bridgeErrorHandler" option within the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages will be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. However, this is only possible if the 3rd party component (in this case, DB2) allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. If the component handles exceptions internally, bridgeErrorHandler may not be possible. In situations where this is not feasible, improvements to the Camel debezium-db2 component could enable this feature in future releases. By default, the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, which will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. This option is part of the "consumer (advanced)" group and its default value is false.'

      answer: |
       'The `incrementalSnapshotWatermarkingStrategy` option in Apache Camel''s debezium-db2 component can take two values: ''insert_insert'' and ''insert_delete''.              The ''insert_insert'' strategy writes both open and close signals into the signal data collection, meaning that both the start and end of an incremental snapshot are recorded. This is the default behavior.              On the other hand, the ''insert_delete'' strategy only writes the open signal on the signal data collection. The close event will delete the relative open signal in the data collection. This means that the end of a snapshot is not explicitly marked; instead, it is implied when the corresponding open event is deleted.'

    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''messageKeyColumns'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component and how should it be formatted when specifying table names and key columns for a custom message key? Also, can you explain what happens if this option is not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The ''messageKeyColumns'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component serves to define a semicolon-separated list of expressions that specify fully-qualified tables and columns to be used as message keys. The format for table names can either be (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on the specific connector. Each expression should follow the pattern '':'', where the key columns are a comma-separated list of columns representing the custom key. For any table without an explicit key configuration, the table''s primary key column(s) will automatically be used as message keys. An example of its usage is: `dbserver1.inventory.orderlines:orderId,orderLineId;dbserver1.inventory.orders:id`. If this option is not specified, the connector will use the table''s primary key column(s) as the default message key.'

      answer: |
       'When you set the option "schemaHistoryInternalSkipUnparseableDdl" of the Apache Camel component ''debezium-db2'' to true, Debezium will continue operating even when it encounters an unparseable DDL statement in the binlog. By default, the connector stops functioning upon encountering such statements. However, if skipping is enabled, Debezium may miss some metadata changes as it ignores the unparseable DDL statements instead of halting its operation. This configuration choice allows for more resilient data replication but potentially at the cost of complete metadata synchronization.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the "schemaHistoryInternalStoreOnlyCapturedDatabasesDdl" option in the Apache Camel''s debezium-db2 component, and what happens if this option is set to false?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "schemaHistoryInternalStoreOnlyCapturedDatabasesDdl" option in the Apache Camel''s debezium-db2 component is such that only DDL manipulating a table from captured schema/database will be stored in the database schema history. If this option is set to false, Debezium will store all incoming DDL statements, meaning it will capture and log DDL events for all databases, not just those that are being captured.'
    - question: 'Here is a question that can be answered using the provided information:              What is the default behavior of the "schemaHistoryInternalStoreOnlyCapturedTablesDdl" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component regarding the storage of DDL statements in the database schema history?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "schemaHistoryInternalStoreOnlyCapturedTablesDdl" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component is to store all incoming DDL statements by default (false). If set to true, it will only store DDL that manipulates a captured table.'
    - question: 'What are the available options for the schemaNameAdjustmentMode property in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component and how do they impact the compatibility with the Avro type name, specifically comparing ''avro'' and ''avro_unicode'' adjustments to the characters that cannot be used in an Avro type name?'
      answer: |
       'The `schemaNameAdjustmentMode` property in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component provides options to adjust schema names for compatibility with the message converter used by the connector, specifically when using the Avro format. The available modes are ''avro'', ''avro_unicode'', and ''none'' (default).              The ''avro'' mode replaces characters that cannot be used in an Avro type name with underscores (_), while the ''avro_unicode'' mode uses Unicode escapes (like _uxxxx) for replacing underscores or characters that are not allowed in an Avro type name. This helps ensure compatibility between your schema names and the Avro type name requirements.              To summarize, using ''avro'' will replace disallowed characters with underscores (_), while ''avro_unicode'' uses Unicode escapes to achieve the same goal, providing more flexibility in naming conventions when working with Avro types.'

The implementation groups for this option are specifically related to DB2 databases.'
    - question: 'How should you configure the `snapshotSelectStatementOverrides` option in the Apache Camel debezium-db2 component for specifying a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting for a large append-only table during snapshotting, if a previous snapshotting was interrupted?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the `snapshotSelectStatementOverrides` option in the Apache Camel Debezium-DB2 component for specifying a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting for a large append-only table during snapshotting, if a previous snapshotting was interrupted, you should do the following:              1. Identify the name of your DB2 database and the append-only table that requires resumable snapshotting. Let''s call them `DB_NAME` and `TABLE_NAME`, respectively.              2. Use the `snapshotSelectStatementOverrides` property in the configuration of the Debezium-DB2 component. The value for `snapshotSelectStatementOverrides` should be a comma-separated list containing the fully qualified name of your table or schema, depending on your connector. Set it as follows:                 ```          snapshotSelectStatementOverrides=DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME          ```              3. Next, define separate configuration properties for each identified table using the format `snapshot.select.statement.overrides.<DB_NAME>.<TABLE_NAME>`. For instance:                 ```          snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME=SELECT * FROM <TABLE_NAME> WHERE YOUR_COLUMN > LAST_SNAPSHOT_TIMESTAMP          ```              4. Replace `YOUR_COLUMN` with the column name that contains timestamps in your table, and `LAST_SNAPSHOT_TIMESTAMP` with the timestamp of the last successful snapshot that you want to resume from.              By following these steps, you have successfully configured the Debezium-DB2 component for resuming snapshotting at a specific point when dealing with large append-only tables.'

    - question: 'What are the available options for the ''timePrecisionMode'' setting in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-db2'', and what is their respective impact on the representation of time, date, and timestamp values in the messages produced by this component? Also, what is the default value for this option and which groups does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component ''debezium-db2'', the available options for the ''timePrecisionMode'' setting are ''adaptive'' (default), ''adaptive_time_microseconds'', and ''connect''. The ''adaptive'' mode bases the precision of time, date, and timestamp values on the database column''s precision. The ''adaptive_time_microseconds'' mode works similarly to ''adaptive'', but TIME fields always use microseconds precision. The ''connect'' mode represents time, date, and timestamp values using Kafka Connect''s built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which uses millisecond precision regardless of the database columns'' precision. The default value is ''adaptive'', and this option belongs to the ''db2'' groups.'
    - question: 'In regards to the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2", what is the default behavior of the option "tombstonesOnDelete" and can it be configured differently, if so, how?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "tombstonesOnDelete" option for the Apache Camel component "debezium-db2" is set to false. However, this value can be configured differently. If you set it to true, delete operations in your database will be represented by a delete event and a subsequent tombstone event. This configuration allows Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to the given key once the source record has been deleted from the database. If you don''t need this behavior, you can leave it at its default value of false. This option falls under the "db2" group in the configuration.'
