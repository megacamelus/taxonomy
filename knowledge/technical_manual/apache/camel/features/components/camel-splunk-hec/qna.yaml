    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Splunk HECSFTP component, and under what scenarios might it be beneficial to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Splunk-HEC component is designed to control whether the producer should start lazily (on the first message). This can be useful when the initial startup of a producer might fail, causing the entire route to fail during starting. By deferring the startup using the "lazyStartProducer" option, you can handle any startup failures via Camel''s routing error handlers without preventing the route from being started altogether.              However, note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some additional time, thereby prolonging the total processing time of the processing. The default value for this option is false, meaning the producer starts immediately upon context startup. Setting it to true can be beneficial in scenarios where a producer''s initial startup might fail due to transient issues, or when you want more control over when the producer begins sending messages.'
    - question: 'What''s the purpose and default value of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "splunk-hec", and is its usage considered mandatory or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "splunk-hec" determines whether automatic autowiring is enabled. This feature allows for the automatic configuration of components like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, among others, by looking up in the registry to find a single instance of matching type. The default value for this option is true, meaning that autowiring is enabled by default. Its usage is considered optional, as indicated by the "required": false field in the configuration details you''ve provided.'
    - question: 'How can I set custom SSL context parameters when using the Apache Camel Splunk-HEC component, and is it mandatory to provide these parameters if not specified by default?'
      answer: |
       'To set custom SSL context parameters when using the Apache Camel Splunk-HEC component, you can configure the ''sslContextParameters'' option within your settings. This allows you to define a default SSL configuration that will apply to all endpoints, although you can also configure it directly at the endpoint level if desired. It is not mandatory to provide these parameters as they have no default value; their use depends on your specific security requirements. These settings fall under the ''security'' group in the component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "useGlobalSslContextParameters" option in the Apache Camel Splunk-HEC component, and is it a required configuration parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The "useGlobalSslContextParameters" option in the Apache Camel Splunk-HEC component allows for enabling the usage of global SSL context parameters. By default, this option is set to false, meaning that it''s not initially configured to use global SSL context parameters. However, it''s an optional configuration parameter and can be modified as needed within the "security" group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "bodyOnly" option in the Apache Camel Splunk HEC component, and is it required when using this component as a producer?'
      answer: |
       'The "bodyOnly" option within the Apache Camel Splunk HEC (Heartbeat Event Collector) component controls whether only the message body should be sent to Splunk. Its default value is false, meaning that both the message body and headers are typically sent. However, setting it to true will result in sending only the message body when using this component as a producer. It''s important to note that it is not required to set "bodyOnly" to true; you can choose whether or not to use it based on your specific data requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''headersOnly'' option in the Apache Camel ''splunk-hec'' component, and is it mandatory to use this option when using the producer?'
      answer: |
       'The ''headersOnly'' option in the Apache Camel ''splunk-hec'' component serves the purpose of sending only message headers during data transmission. By default, this option is set to false, meaning that both headers and body are sent. However, you can choose to use this option if you wish to send only headers, making it optional for use in the producer.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "host" option in the Apache Camel''s splunk-hec component, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "host" option in the Apache Camel''s Splunk HEC (Heavy Event Collector) component is a field within the event message that gets sent to Splunk. It does not represent the Splunk host for connection purposes. The default value for this field is null, meaning it can be set to any appropriate string value when sending events. Using this option is not required as its inclusion is optional when utilizing the splunk-hec component in Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the default Splunk index for data written using the Apache Camel splunk-hec component, and can the choice of index be overridden when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default Splunk index for data written using the Apache Camel splunk-hec component is "camel". Yes, you can override the choice of index when using this component as the option for selecting an index is not required by default.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "source" option in the Apache Camel Splunk-HEC component, and is it required? (Answer: The default value is ''camel'' of type string and it is not required.)'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "source" option in the Apache Camel Splunk-HEC component is a string type set to ''camel''. It is not a required field.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "sourceType" option in the Apache Camel Splunk-HEC component, and is it required when using this producer group?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "sourceType" option in the Apache Camel Splunk-HEC component is a string type, denoted by "camel". It''s not a required parameter within the "producer" group, meaning you can choose to provide a custom sourcetype when using this component if desired.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `splunkEndpoint` option within the Apache Camel''s `splunk-hec` component, and how can one modify its default value to use the raw data input like JSON instead of event format in Splunk? Also, where can one find documentation for available endpoints in the Splunk HTTP Event Collector REST API, and what should be done to enable timestamp extraction when using the endpoint `/services/collector/event` with Splunk 8.0?'
      answer: |
       'The `splunkEndpoint` option within Apache Camel''s `splunk-hec` component is used for specifying the Splunk endpoint where data will be sent. By default, it is set to "/services/collector/event". If you want to use raw data input like JSON instead of event format in Splunk, you should modify this option to "/services/collector/raw".              For a comprehensive list of all available endpoints in the Splunk HTTP Event Collector REST API, please refer to the documentation (HTTP Event Collector REST API endpoints) found here: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/8.2.2203/Data/HECRESTendpoints              For Splunk 8.0 specifically, to extract timestamps, set `auto_extract_timestamp=true` when using the endpoint "/services/collector/event". If there are any question marks or slashes in your parameters, remember to use RAW{} for proper formatting.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the SSLContextParameters option within the Apache Camel Splunk-HEC component, and is its usage optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'The "SSLContextParameters" option within the Apache Camel Splunk-HEC component is used for configuring SSL settings. Its default value is null, meaning no specific SSL configuration is set by default. The usage of this option is optional; it''s not required to provide SSLContextParameters when using the Splunk-HEC producer component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "time" option in the Apache Camel component named "splunk-hec", and is it required? Furthermore, where does this option belong within the component group structure (producers)?'
      answer: |
       'The "time" option in the Apache Camel component named "splunk-hec" serves the purpose of indicating when an event occurred. By default, the time will be set as when the event reaches the Splunk server. The default value for this option is not specified (null). This option is optional, meaning it''s not required to include it in your configuration. Lastly, regarding the component group structure, this "time" option belongs under the "producers" group since it pertains to the configuration options related to producing or emitting events within the Splunk HEC (Heartbeat Event Collector) component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of configuring the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component "splunk-hec," and under what circumstances might it be beneficial to set this option to true? Additionally, can you explain any potential drawbacks or performance implications associated with using this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component "splunk-hec" allows you to defer the startup of a producer until the first message is processed. This can be beneficial when a producer may fail during the initial start-up, preventing the route from being started. By starting the producer lazily, you can handle startup failures using Camel''s routing error handlers, rather than causing the entire route to fail during initialization.              However, it is important to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some additional time, potentially prolonging the overall processing time of the messages. This could impact performance in high-throughput scenarios where every millisecond counts.              In summary, configuring "lazyStartProducer" to true can help manage start-up failures for your Splunk HEC producer, but be aware that it might introduce a slight performance overhead when processing the first message.'
    - question: 'How do you configure the Apache Camel splunk-hec component to contact the HEC server over a secure HTTPS connection, and is it set as the default value?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel `splunk-hec` component to connect to the HEC server over a secure HTTPS connection, you need to specify the "option" as "https". This option can be found in the component''s configuration. However, by default, the value is already set to true for HTTPS. Therefore, no explicit change is required if you wish to use SSL/TLS encryption for your communication. The group associated with this setting is "security".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and group of the "skipTlsVerify" option in the Apache Camel Splunk-HEC component, particularly in terms of its relevance to TLS verification?'
      answer: |
       'The "skipTlsVerify" option within the Apache Camel Splunk-HEC component is designed for TLS (Transport Layer Security) verification. Its purpose is to control whether SSL/TLS certificate validation should be performed during the communication between your application and Splunk HEC. By default, this option is set to false, meaning that SSL/TLS certificate validation is enabled. The data type of "skipTlsVerify" is boolean, and it''s optional, as you may not always need to disable TLS verification. This setting falls under the "security" group, indicating its relevance to maintaining secure connections between your application and Splunk HEC.'
    - question: 'What should be provided as the value for the "token" option in the Apache Camel splunk-hec component, which is related to security, and for which there is no default value?'
      answer: |
       'To use the Splunk Heavyweight Indexer (HEC) component with Apache Camel, you''ll need to provide a string value as the token for the "token" option. Please note that this token refers specifically to the HEC token, not the user''s token. This token should be created separately for HEC and is grouped under security settings due to its sensitive nature. Since there''s no default value for this option, it must be provided explicitly during configuration.'
