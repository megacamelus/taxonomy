    - question: 'What is the purpose and format of the "additionalProperties" option within the Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component, and could you provide an example of how it can be used to set Kafka Connect properties for Debezium engine in a Camel configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "additionalProperties" option in Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component serves as a means to configure extra properties that cannot be set directly on the Camel configurations. This is particularly useful when setting Kafka Connect properties needed by the Debezium engine, for example, to configure KafkaOffsetBackingStore. The properties are prefixed with "additionalProperties."              For instance, if you wish to set KafkaOffsetBackingStore and schema registry URL in your Camel configuration, you can do so as follows:              ```       debezium-sqlserver(          ...          additionalProperties.transactional.id=12345          additionalProperties.schema.registry.url=http://localhost:8811/avro          ...       )       ```'
    - question: 'How can we configure Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component to bridge errors occurring while the consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages to the Camel routing Error Handler, if it supports such functionality? And, what is the default behavior when the bridgeErrorHandler option is not set or false in this configuration?'
      answer: |
       'To configure Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component to bridge errors occurring while the consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages to the Camel routing Error Handler, you can set the "bridgeErrorHandler" option to true in your component configuration. Here is an example:              ```json       debezium-sqlserver: {         ...         bridgeErrorHandler: true         ...       }       ```              Please note that not all third-party components support this functionality, as some handle exceptions internally only. When the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is not set or false in the configuration, the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions. These exceptions will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored by default.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the configuration option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component, and is it optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'The "configuration" option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component allows pre-defined configurations to be set, but it does not have a default value (defaultValue: null). Whether you use this option is optional (required: false), and it falls under the "consumer" group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "internalKeyConverter" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver", and what is its default value if not specified? Also, how can this option be configured if a custom Converter class is desired instead of the JSON converter?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver," the "internalKeyConverter" option is responsible for handling the serialization and deserialization of key data for offsets during asynchronous replication of SQL Server changes. The default value for this option is `org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter`, which means that JSON is used to convert keys if no specific converter is specified. If you wish to use a custom Converter class instead of the JSON converter, you can configure it by setting the "internalKeyConverter" property to your desired Converter class when using this component.'
    - question: 'What is the default Converter class used for serializing and deserializing value data for offsets when using the internalValueConverter option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component, and can its usage be opted out if needed?'
      answer: |
       'The default Converter class used for serializing and deserializing value data for offsets, when using the ''internalValueConverter'' option within the Apache Camel ''debezium-sqlserver'' component, is org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter. However, its usage can be opted out as the requirement for it is marked as "optional" in the configuration.'
    - question: 'What are the possible values for the debezium-sqlserver''s offsetCommitPolicy option in Apache Camel, and can it be configured to use a custom Java class that implements the OffsetCommitPolicy interface? Also, what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The `offsetCommitPolicy` option in the debezium-sqlserver component of Apache Camel accepts a string value representing the name of the Java class implementing the ''OffsetCommitPolicy'' interface. The class chosen will dictate when the offsets commit should be triggered, considering factors like the number of events processed and the time elapsed since the last commit. By default, this option employs a periodic commit policy based on time intervals. It can be configured to utilize a custom Java class of your choice that adheres to the specified interface. The default value for this option is null, meaning it relies on the built-in default implementation if no specific value is provided.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum time duration, in milliseconds, that the option ''offsetCommitTimeoutMs'' of the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component can be configured to wait for records to be committed before cancelling a process, and what is its default value? Additionally, is it a required configuration, and which group does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The option ''offsetCommitTimeoutMs'' of the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component can be configured to wait for records to be committed for a maximum duration of 5000 milliseconds (or 5 seconds). Its default value is 5000ms. This configuration is not required and belongs to the "consumer" group.'
    - question: 'How long should the interval be (in milliseconds) for the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component''s option "offsetFlushIntervalMs" if it is not set explicitly and the default value is used?'
      answer: |
       'If you do not specify an interval for the offsetFlushIntervalMs option in the Apache Camel Debezium-SQLServer component, the default interval will be 60000 milliseconds or 1 minute.'
    - question: 'What is the default Java class used for storing the offsets in Apache Camel''s Debezium SQL Server component (debezium-sqlserver) when the offsetStorage option is not explicitly provided, and which group does this configuration belong to?'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s Debezium SQL Server component (debezium-sqlserver), when the offsetStorage option is not explicitly provided, the default Java class used for storing the offsets is org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.FileOffsetBackingStore. This configuration belongs to the "consumer" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "offsetStorageFileName" option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component, and is it required if the "offset.storage" is set to the FileOffsetBackingStore? Additionally, can you specify a default value or any groups this option belongs to?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageFileName" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-SQL Server component is responsible for specifying the path to a file where offsets are stored when the "offset.storage" is set to the FileOffsetBackingStore. While it''s not strictly required, setting it will allow you to manually specify the location of this file. This option takes a string value and belongs to the consumer groups. However, it doesn''t have a default value, so if you choose not to provide one, Camel will not automatically assign a value for it.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for and is it required for the `offsetStoragePartitions` option in the Apache Camel component Debezium-SQLServer when using KafkaOffsetBackingStore as the offset storage, if it''s not provided explicitly?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `offsetStoragePartitions` option in the Apache Camel component Debezium-SQLServer, when using KafkaOffsetBackingStore as the offset storage, is null. It is not required, meaning you can provide a value if you wish to customize it, but if you do not specify it explicitly, it will not be set by default.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "offsetStorageReplicationFactor" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-sqlserver" component when using Kafka Offset Backing Store for offset storage, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageReplicationFactor" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-sqlserver" component, when using Kafka Offset Backing Store for offset storage, specifies the replication factor used when creating the offset storage topic. This option is required only if your offset storage configuration is set to KafkaOffsetBackingStore. Its default value is null, meaning it can be left unset unless you specifically want to provide a replication factor other than the default. In summary, while it''s optional, you need to supply a value for this option when using Kafka for offset storage.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "offsetStorageTopic" option in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component, and is its usage required when setting the "offset.storage"? Furthermore, what data type does this option expect?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageTopic" option in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component is used to specify the name of a Kafka topic where offsets will be stored. This is relevant when the `offset.storage` setting is set to the KafkaOffsetBackingStore, meaning that offset information will persist across restarts within a Kafka topic. While not required, you can choose an appropriate value for this option if needed to manage your offsets in a centralized and distributed manner using Apache Kafka topics. This option expects a string data type.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-sqlserver'', and is it required for basic functionality?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component ''debezium-sqlserver'', the ''autowiredEnabled'' option has a default value of true and is used to enable or disable automatic autowiring. This means that if this option is set to true, it allows for the automatic configuration of components such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, etc., by looking up in the registry to find a single instance of matching type. However, its usage is optional and marked as an advanced feature, meaning it''s not required for the basic functionality of the ''debezium-sqlserver'' component.'
    - question: 'What is the default and possible values for the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component option ''binaryHandlingMode'', and which group does this option belong to? The default value is ''bytes'', and the possible values are ''bytes'', ''base64'', ''base64-url-safe'', and ''hex''. This option belongs to the ''sqlserver'' group.'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component, the default value for the ''binaryHandlingMode'' option is ''bytes'', meaning binary data in change events are represented as byte arrays. However, you can also opt to have binary data represented as base64-encoded string, base64-url-safe-encoded string, or hex-encoded (base16) string by setting the value to ''base64'', ''base64-url-safe'', or ''hex'' respectively. Please note that this option is not required and belongs to the ''sqlserver'' group.'
    - question: 'How do you configure regular expressions in the "columnExcludeList" option of the "debezium-sqlserver" component in Apache Camel to exclude certain columns from being included in change events? Is there a default value for this configuration, and is its usage optional?'
      answer: |
       'To exclude certain columns from being included in change events using regular expressions with the "columnExcludeList" option of the "debezium-sqlserver" component in Apache Camel, you would configure it as a comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the column names. For example:              ```       columnExcludeList=^myColumn1$, ^myColumn2$       ```              In the above example, the regular expression `^myColumn1$` will match any column name ending with "myColumn1", and the regular expression `^myColumn2$` will match any column name ending with "myColumn2". The square brackets (`[]`) around the caret (`^`) are not necessary, but they are often used for readability in regex expressions.              Note that there is no default value for this configuration; you can either provide a non-empty string or omit it if all columns should be included. The usage of the "columnExcludeList" option is optional; by default, all columns will be included in change events. If provided, the regular expression(s) will take precedence over the default inclusion behavior.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, and data type of the "columnIncludeList" option within the Apache Camel Debezium-SQLServer component, and is it mandatory or optional when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "columnIncludeList" option within the Apache Camel Debezium-SQLServer component is an optional setting, with a data type of string. Its purpose is to specify regular expressions matching columns to include in change events. The default value for this option is null.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "columnPropagateSourceType" option in the Apache Camel component named "debezium-sqlserver", and is it required? Also, what type of data does this option expect and what groups is it associated with?'
      answer: |
       'The "columnPropagateSourceType" option in the Apache Camel component named "debezium-sqlserver" serves the purpose of propagating the original column types and lengths to the corresponding fields in emitted change records, by using a comma-separated list of regular expressions that match fully-qualified names of columns. The default value for this option is null, meaning it is not set if no customization is desired. This option is expected to receive string data. It should be noted that the use of this option is not mandatory, as it can be set to false or omitted entirely. Lastly, this option belongs to the "sqlserver" group, indicating its relevance within SQL Server-specific configurations for Debezium.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, usage, default value, type, and required status of the "converters" option within the Apache Camel component named "debezium-sqlserver", and in what group does this option belong? Furthermore, how are custom converters defined and configured when using this option?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver," the "converters" option is an optional (not required) string that allows users to specify a list of custom converters. Instead of using the default converters provided by debezium-sqlserver, you can define and configure your own custom converters using the ''.type'' config option followed by options ''.''. The default value for this option is null. This option belongs to the "sqlserver" group. To define and configure a custom converter when using this option, you would first create the custom converter, and then specify it within the string list provided to the ''converters'' option during component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the customMetricTags option in the Apache Camel component debezium-sqlserver, and can it be configured with a string of key-value pairs to specify custom tags for the MBean object name?'
      answer: |
       'The customMetricTags option in the Apache Camel component Debezium-SQLServer allows you to provide custom tags for the Manageable Bean (MBean) object name. This option accepts key-value pairs, where each key represents a tag for the MBean object name, and the corresponding value is the value of that tag associated with the key. The default value for this option is null, meaning no tags are applied by default. You can configure it with a string of key-value pairs to specify your own custom tags when naming the MBean object. For instance: k1=v1,k2=v2 would apply the specified tags to the MBean object name.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "databaseHostname" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver", and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseHostname" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver" defines the resolvable hostname or IP address of the database server. It is not mandatory to provide a value for this option, as it has a default value of null. This option falls under the group of settings specifically related to the SQL Server configuration in the "debezium-sqlserver" component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''databaseInstance'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component? Could this option be configured if not provided its default value, and where would this configuration be typically found under the groups named ''sqlserver''?'
      answer: |
       'The ''databaseInstance'' option within the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component is used to specify the name of your SQL Server instance. This option has no default value by design, allowing users flexibility in their configurations. If you choose not to provide a value for this option, it will not be set with a default and an error might occur as the connection cannot be established without specifying an instance name. The configuration for this option, along with other SQL Server-related settings, would typically be found under the ''sqlserver'' group within your Camel routing configuration or properties file.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the option "databaseNames" in the Apache Camel component called "debezium-sqlserver", and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseNames" option in the Apache Camel component called "debezium-sqlserver" is designed to specify the names of the databases from which the connector should capture changes. The default value for this option is null, meaning that no database is selected by default. This option is optional; you can choose whether or not to provide a list of databases. The group associated with this option is "sqlserver".'
    - question: 'What is the required string type value that should be provided for the "databasePassword" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-sqlserver" component, as this option is used to specify the password of the database user when connecting to the database and it is a required field?'
      answer: |
       'The required string type value that should be provided for the "databasePassword" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-sqlserver" component is the password of the database user, which is utilized when connecting to the database as this option is essential for authentication purposes.'
    - question: 'What is the default port for a Debezium SQL Server component in Apache Camel if the "databasePort" option is not specified, and what data type does this option expect?'
      answer: |
       'The default port for a Debezium SQL Server component in Apache Camel, when the "databasePort" option is not specified, is 1433. This option expects an integer value as input.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the option ''databaseUser'' in the Apache Camel Debezium-SQLServer component, and is it a required or optional parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The ''databaseUser'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium-SQLServer component is designed to specify the name of the database user to be used when connecting to the SQL Server database. Its default value is null, meaning no specific user will be set if not provided. This option is an optional parameter as indicated by the ''required'' field being set to false in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What are the possible values for the Apache Camel `dataQueryMode` option in the `debezium-sqlserver` component, and what is their functionality regarding how the connector queries Change Data Capture (CDC) data? Is there a difference between using ''function'' as the default value versus ''direct'', and are there any other group settings that affect this option?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel `dataQueryMode` option in the `debezium-sqlserver` component has two possible values: ''function'' (the default) and ''direct''. Here''s their functionality regarding how the connector queries Change Data Capture (CDC) data:              1. ''function'': The connector queries the CDC data by calling the cdc.fn_cdc_get_all_changes_# function.       2. ''direct'': In this mode, the connector queries the change tables directly.              There''s a functional difference between using ''function'' (default) and ''direct''. While ''function'' queries data by calling functions, ''direct'' skips that step to query the change tables directly, which might impact performance but also offers some benefits for certain use cases.              Lastly, other group settings affecting this option include the `sqlserver` group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the option "datatypePropagateSourceType" in the Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component, and is it a required or optional setting? Additionally, could you provide an example of how to use regular expressions with this option if I want to propagate source type for SQL Server varchar(50) and nvarchar(100) types?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel''s Debezium-SQLServer component, the "datatypePropagateSourceType" option allows you to add the original data type''s information (type and original length) as parameters to the fields schemas in the emitted change records. The default value for this option is null. It is an optional setting, meaning that you can choose whether or not to use it when configuring your Debezium-SQLServer component.              To propagate source type for SQL Server varchar(50) and nvarchar(100) types, you can specify regular expressions in a comma-separated list. For example, if you want to propagate the original data type for varchar with any length, you might use "^varchar$". To include both varchar and nvarchar, you could use "^(varchar|nvarchar)$". This way, when changes occur in these columns, Debezium will automatically add the original data type information (e.g., "varchar(50)" or "nvarchar(100)") to the emitted change records as extra metadata.'
    - question: 'How does the ''decimalHandlingMode'' option within the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component affect the representation of DECIMAL and NUMERIC columns in change events, and what are the available options for this setting? Additionally, what is the default value for this option and which data type groups is it associated with?'
      answer: |
       'The ''decimalHandlingMode'' option within the Apache Camel Debezium-SQLServer component influences how DECIMAL and NUMERIC columns are represented in change events. It allows you to specify three modes:              1. ''precise'': This is the default mode. In this mode, java.math.BigDecimal is used for value representation, which utilizes a binary format when encoded in the change events along with the Kafka Connect''s ''org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Decimal'' data type.       2. ''string'': Here, string is employed to represent the values without offering the precision levels that you get from other modes.       3. ''double'': In this mode, values are represented using Java''s ''double''. This option may sacrifice precision for easier usage in consumer applications.              The default value for this option is ''precise'', and it is associated with the ''sqlserver'' data type groups.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the option "errorsMaxRetries" in the Apache Camel component named "debezium-sqlserver", and what type is this option? If we choose to not set a specific number of retries, what will happen with this option?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the option "errorsMaxRetries" in the Apache Camel component called "debezium-sqlserver" is -1, which signifies no limit on the number of retries on connection errors. If you decide not to set a specific number of retries for this option, it will continue with no limits. The type of this option is "integer".'
    - question: 'What are the available options for handling failures during event processing in Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component, and what is the default value when this option is not specified?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component, you have three options for handling failures during event processing: ''fail'' (which raises an exception indicating the problematic event and its position, causing the connector to be stopped), ''warn'' (where the problematic event and its position are logged and the event is skipped), and ''ignore'' (where the problematic event is simply skipped without logging or raising an exception). The default value for this option when it is not specified is ''fail''.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "heartbeatActionQuery" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-SqlServer component, and is it optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "heartbeatActionQuery" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-SqlServer component is an action executed with every heartbeat. Its default value is null. This option is optional as indicated by the "required: false." The group that this option belongs to is specifically for SqlServer.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and description for the "heartbeatIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-SqlServer component, and can this option be left unset/omitted when configuring a connector?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "heartbeatIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-SqlServer component is 0ms, meaning that heartbeat messages are disabled by default. This option controls the interval in milliseconds between which the connector periodically sends heartbeat messages to a heartbeat topic. If you wish to enable heartbeats, you can specify a positive integer value for this option; otherwise, you can leave it unset if you prefer not to use heartbeat messages when configuring your connector.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible usage of the ''heartbeatTopicsPrefix'' option within the Apache Camel ''debezium-sqlserver'' component? Furthermore, how can this option be configured to use a different prefix than its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The ''heartbeatTopicsPrefix'' option within the Apache Camel ''debezium-sqlserver'' component is used to name the heartbeat topics. By default, it sets the prefix as "__debezium-heartbeat". This option is optional and can be configured to use a different prefix than its default value. To set a custom prefix, simply specify your preferred string during the configuration of the ''debezium-sqlserver'' component. For instance, if you want to use "myCustomPrefix", you would configure it like this:              ```       DebeziumSqlServerComponent myDebeziumComponent = new DebeziumSqlServerComponent();       myDebeziumComponent.bind("myCustomPrefix")                          .heartbeatTopicsPrefix("myCustomPrefix");       ```'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the option "includeSchemaChanges" in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component, and is it mandatory to use this feature when implementing this connector?'
      answer: |
       'The option "includeSchemaChanges" in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component enables publishing of database schema changes to a Kafka topic. When set to ''true'' (default), each schema change will be recorded using a key that contains the database name and its logical description along with the DDL statement(s) if provided. This is independent of the connector''s internal database schema history recording mechanism. Using this feature is optional; it is not mandatory when implementing the Debezium SQL Server component.'
    - question: 'Here is a potential question:              "What is the default value and purpose of the ''includeSchemaComments'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-sqlserver'', and what are the potential implications on memory usage when enabling it?"'
      answer: |
       'The default value of the ''includeSchemaComments'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-sqlserver'' is ''false''. This option determines whether the Debezium connector should parse table and column comments as part of the metadata object. Enabling this option might have implications on memory usage, as it increases the size of ColumnImpl objects which largely impacts how much memory is consumed by the Debezium connectors. Adding a comment string to each ColumnImpl object can potentially be quite heavy.'
    - question: 'Here''s a question that could be answered using the provided information about the Apache Camel component `debezium-sqlserver` option named `incrementalSnapshotAllowSchemaChanges`:              "What is the functionality of the ''incrementalSnapshotAllowSchemaChanges'' option in the ''debezium-sqlserver'' component in Apache Camel and what are its limitations? Is it required, and if not, does it have a default value?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''incrementalSnapshotAllowSchemaChanges'' option for the Apache Camel component `debezium-sqlserver` enables it to detect schema changes during an incremental snapshot, allowing it to reselect the current chunk instead of locking DDLs. However, modifications to a primary key are not supported and can result in incorrect data. It is worth noting that if a schema change affects only columns'' default values, these changes won''t be detected until the DDL is processed from the binlog stream. This might cause snapshot events'' schemas to have outdated defaults. The option has a default value of false and it is not required for usage in `debezium-sqlserver`.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the option "incrementalSnapshotChunkSize" in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component, and is it necessary to provide a value for this option when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the option "incrementalSnapshotChunkSize" in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component is an integer with the value 1024. It specifies the maximum size of a chunk (number of documents/rows) during incremental snapshotting. Providing a value for this option is not necessary as it''s set to false under "required" in the configuration, meaning it can be optionally overridden according to specific use cases.'
    - question: 'How does setting the "incrementalSnapshotOptionRecompile" option to true for the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver" impact the performance and parameter sniffing issues of the source database? Also, what is the default value and can it be omitted during configuration?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "incrementalSnapshotOptionRecompile" option to true for the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver" impacts the performance and parameter sniffing issues of the source database by adding OPTION(RECOMPILE) on each SELECT statement during the incremental snapshot process. This prevents parameter sniffing, which may help avoid query plan inefficiencies caused by misinterpretations about the distribution of input parameters. However, this can lead to increased CPU pressure on the source database as each SELECT is recompiled every time it''s executed, potentially affecting overall performance. The default value for this option is false, meaning parameter sniffing will occur unless explicitly set to true during configuration. It is not a required setting, meaning you can choose to omit it if desired, but doing so may affect your parameter sniffing and query efficiency.'
    - question: 'What are the available strategies for incremental snapshot watermarking when using the debezium-sqlserver component in Apache Camel and what is the default strategy for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The Debezium-SQLServer component in Apache Camel offers two strategies for incremental snapshot watermarking: ''insert_insert'' and ''insert_delete''. In the ''insert_insert'' strategy, both open and close signals are written into the signal data collection (default). On the other hand, with the ''insert_delete'' strategy, only the open signal is written on the signal data collection, and the close will delete the corresponding open signal.

    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "maxIterationTransactions" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-sqlserver" component, what is its default value and data type, and is it required when using this component? Additionally, can you explain how adjusting this property may affect connector memory usage footprint and streaming performance when multiple tables are being streamed from a single database?'
      answer: |
       'The "maxIterationTransactions" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-sqlserver" component is designed to optimize memory usage when multiple tables within a single database are being streamed. By default, this property has a value of 0. It''s an integer data type, and its use is optional as it doesn''t necessarily affect the functionality of the connector when not specified.              Adjusting this property may impact both the connector memory footprint and streaming performance. A higher value for maxIterationTransactions means that more transactions will be batched together before being processed, reducing the number of times the connector iterates over the tables. This can lead to less frequent polling and potentially reduced memory usage due to fewer simultaneous data structures needed to hold the change events. However, it may also result in slightly longer response times, as more transactions will be consolidated together before processing. Conversely, a lower value or leaving it at its default setting means that more iterations over the tables will occur, potentially leading to increased memory usage but also faster individual transaction processing times and quicker responses overall. It''s essential to carefully adjust this property according to the specific requirements of your use case, considering factors like the number of tables being streamed from, the desired streaming performance, and available system resources.'

    - question: 'What is the format for specifying the `messageKeyColumns` option when using the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component, and can it be configured to use custom keys instead of primary key columns? If so, how would you specify a list of fully-qualified tables with specific columns as custom keys in the `messageKeyColumns` setting?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the `messageKeyColumns` option when using the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component, the format is a semicolon-separated list of expressions. Each expression represents a fully-qualified table with specific columns as custom keys.              The pattern for defining table names follows this structure: (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on the specific connector. The key columns in each expression are a comma-separated list of columns representing the custom key.              For instance, if you want to specify dbserver1.inventory.orderlines and orderId, orderLineId as a custom key, the format would be: dbserver1.inventory.orderlines:orderId,orderLineId;dbserver1.inventory.orders:id              If a table does not have an explicit key configuration, the table''s primary key column(s) will automatically be used as message key. In case you have multiple tables to specify with different custom keys, simply concatenate each expression with a semicolon separator.'

      answer: |
       'The default setting for the `schemaNameAdjustmentMode` option when using the Apache Camel Debezium-SqlServer component is ''none'', meaning no adjustments are made to the schema names during data transfer. However, if you wish to specify adjustments compatible with Avro type names, there are two alternative modes:              1. ''avro'': This mode replaces characters in the schema names that cannot be used in Avro type names with underscores (_). For instance, a schema name containing the special character ''.'' would be adjusted as ''_''.              2. ''avro_unicode'': Similar to ''avro'', this mode also adjusts schema names for compatibility with Avro. However, instead of replacing characters with underscores, it uses corresponding Unicode sequences, such as _uxxxx. This can be helpful when dealing with specific characters that are valid in Avro type names but not standard English characters or special symbols.              Remember that the ''_'' symbol acts like an escape sequence (similar to a backslash in Java) within these modes, allowing for easier handling of schema names containing special characters.'

    - question: 'How can you configure the `snapshotSelectStatementOverrides` option in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component to specify custom select statements for individual tables during snapshotting, and what is a possible use case for this feature, specifically regarding large append-only tables?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the `snapshotSelectStatementOverrides` option in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component, you can specify custom select statements for individual tables during snapshotting by using the configuration properties ''snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME'' or ''snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME''. The values of these properties are the specific SQL select statements to use when retrieving data from each table during snapshotting.              One possible use case for this feature, especially for large append-only tables, is resuming snapshotting in case a previous snapshot was interrupted. By providing custom select statements, you can set a specific point where to start or resume the snapshot process. For example, if snapshotting of a table with millions of rows was halted at a certain timestamp, instead of starting from the beginning again, you can specify the select statement that retrieves data from the row just after the last snapshot was taken. This feature helps optimize the performance and efficiency of snapshots for large append-only tables by reducing unnecessary replication of data.'

    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "additionalProperties" option within the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component, specifically regarding setting custom properties for Debezium components not directly configurable through Camel configurations, as demonstrated with an example of setting Kafka Connect properties such as "transactional.id" or "schema.registry.url"? Additionally, is there a default value for this option and can it be configured as a required component property?'
      answer: |
       'The "additionalProperties" option within the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component is used to set custom properties for Debezium components that cannot be configured directly through Camel configurations. This is particularly useful when setting Kafka Connect properties needed by the Debezium engine, such as setting KafkaOffsetBackingStore or transactional ID (e.g., additionalProperties.transactional.id=12345). The schema registry URL (e.g., additionalProperties.schema.registry.url=http://localhost:8811/avro) can also be set in this way.              This option is of type object, meaning it can hold multiple key-value pairs. It''s optional and doesn''t have a default value (defaultValue: null). However, when using it, the properties need to be prefixed with "additionalProperties.". The group associated with this option is "common".              It''s important to note that while this option can provide flexibility, its use may not always be necessary as some properties might have direct configurable options within the Camel configurations. As with any configuration change, it''s recommended to understand and test thoroughly how these settings impact your specific setup before deploying them in a production environment.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "internalKeyConverter" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-sqlserver" component, and what class should be used as the default converter for key data if no custom converter is specified?'
      answer: |
       'The "internalKeyConverter" option within the Apache Camel "debezium-sqlserver" component serves a vital role in handling the serialization and deserialization of key data for offsets. By default, it utilizes the org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter class, which is a JSON converter, to manage these processes. However, if you wish to use a different Converter class, this option allows for customization. It is pertinent to note that specifying a custom converter is optional. The group under which this option can be found is "consumer".'

    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel component debezium-sqlserver and under what conditions will it forward exceptions to the Camel routing Error Handler for processing? Also, if this feature is not currently available with the debezium-sqlserver component due to internal exception handling within the third-party library, are there any plans to improve the Camel component to support bridgeErrorHandler in future releases?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver" enables forwarding of exceptions encountered during message consumption to the Camel routing Error Handler for processing. This is beneficial when the Camel consumer experiences exceptions while trying to pick up incoming messages, allowing for custom error handling instead of logging and ignoring them. However, this functionality depends on whether the third-party library permits Camel to be notified of any thrown exceptions, as some components may handle exceptions internally without this capability. If the debezium-sqlserver component doesn''t support bridgeErrorHandler due to its internal exception handling, there are plans to improve the Camel component in future releases to facilitate compatibility with more third-party libraries and better leverage the bridgeErrorHandler feature.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "exceptionHandler" option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component, and under what circumstances will it not be used if the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled? Also, can you explain when the default exception handling behavior occurs for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "exceptionHandler" option in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component is designed to allow the consumer to use a custom ExceptionHandler. If the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled, then the "exceptionHandler" is not used because the error handling is being handled at the bridge level. By default, exceptions that are logged at the WARN or ERROR level will be dealt with by the consumer and ignored. However, if no custom exception handler is provided (as indicated by its null default value), the default behavior for this option is to ignore these exceptions.'

Each table name could either include the database name (`DB_NAME`) or schema name (`SCHEMA_NAME`), depending on your connector''s specific implementation. The key columns are a comma-separated list of columns representing the custom key you wish to use.              For tables without an explicit key configuration, the table''s primary key column(s) will be used as message key by default. In case you do not provide this option, there will be no specified message key for those tables and the connector will utilize the primary key by default.'

      answer: |
       'The `tableIncludeList` option within the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component is designed to specify the tables for which changes will be tracked (i.e., captured). Its default value is null, meaning that no tables are specified by default and all tables in the connected database will have their changes captured if not otherwise stated. The inclusion of this option in the configuration is optional, so it is not a mandatory requirement to use it when setting up the debezium-sqlserver component.'
    - question: 'What are the possible values and the default value for the ''timePrecisionMode'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-sqlserver'', and can it affect the precision of TIME, DATE, and TIMESTAMP fields when working with Kafka? Also, are there any specific conditions or precisions this option uses if a database column has its own defined precision?'
      answer: |
       'The ''timePrecisionMode'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-sqlserver'' can have three values: ''adaptive'' (default), ''adaptive_time_microseconds'', and ''connect''. The ''adaptive'' mode bases the precision of time, date, and timestamp values on the database column''s precision. The ''adaptive_time_microseconds'' mode works similarly to ''adaptive'', but TIME fields always use microseconds precision. ''Connect'' mode represents all time, date, and timestamp values using Kafka Connect''s built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which uses millisecond precision regardless of the database columns'' precision. If a database column has its own defined precision, the ''adaptive'' and ''adaptive_time_microseconds'' modes will respect that, while the ''connect'' mode will override it with millisecond precision.'
