    - question: 'What are the additional properties that can be set for the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component, specifically to configure Kafka Connect properties like setting the KafkaOffsetBackingStore and Schema Registry URL, and how should these properties be named in the configuration file?'
      answer: |
       'The additional properties for configuring the Apache Camel Debezium-SQLServer component can be set using the prefix "additionalProperties." These properties are used to set Kafka Connect options that cannot be directly configured on the Camel configurations, such as setting the Kafka Offset Backing Store and Schema Registry URL.              For instance, to configure the Kafka Offset Backing Store, you can use: `additionalProperties.transactional.id=12345`. This sets the transaction ID for the offset backing store.              To set the Schema Registry URL, you can use: `additionalProperties.schema.registry.url=http://localhost:8811/avro`. This sets the URL of the Avro schema registry that Debezium will use to serialize and deserialize messages.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component, and how does it differ from the default exception handling provided by Camel?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component enables bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions, if possible, occurring while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.              However, it''s important to note that this feature is only available for components that allow Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. Some third-party components handle exceptions internally and do not support this functionality. For those components, the default consumer will use the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler` to deal with exceptions, logging them at WARN or ERROR level and ignoring them.              In situations where the "bridgeErrorHandler" is enabled, exceptions are treated as messages instead of being ignored or logged. This can provide a more robust error handling strategy for your application.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "configuration" option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component, and is it required when using this component as a consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The "configuration" option in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component allows for pre-configured settings to be applied. It does not have a default value and its usage is optional when employing this component as a consumer within the Camel groups.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "internalKeyConverter" option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component and what class would be used as the default converter if no custom converter is provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "internalKeyConverter" option in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component serves to specify a Converter class that serializes and deserializes key data for offsets within Kafka connectors. By default, the org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter is used, which converts key data into JSON format. This option is optional and falls under the consumer group in terms of its functionality.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "internalValueConverter" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver", and what is its default value if not explicitly set, along with information about whether it is a required configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "internalValueConverter" option within the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver" serves to specify the Converter class used for serializing and deserializing value data related to offsets. By default, if not explicitly set, this option uses the JSON converter (org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter). It''s essential to note that this configuration is optional, as it can be skipped if you wish to stick with the default JSON converter setting in your consumer setup.'
    - question: 'What are the possible values for the debezium-sqlserver component''s offsetCommitPolicy option in Apache Camel, and what does it do when set to a custom value rather than using the default?'
      answer: |
       'The `offsetCommitPolicy` option in the "debezium-sqlserver" component of Apache Camel can take a string value representing the name of a Java class that implements the ''OffsetCommitPolicy'' interface. This class defines when offset commits should be triggered based on the number of events processed and the time elapsed since the last commit. The default value is set to a periodic commit policy based upon time intervals. When you set it to a custom value, it allows for custom control over when offsets are committed, enabling more fine-grained control over data consistency in your data integration pipeline using Debezium with Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum wait time for records to flush and partition offset data to be committed to offset storage in Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component when using the offsetCommitTimeoutMs option, and what is its default value if not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The maximum wait time for records to flush and partition offset data to be committed to offset storage in Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component, when using the offsetCommitTimeoutMs option, is configurable up to a maximum of 5 seconds. If not specified, the default value is 5000 milliseconds or 5 seconds.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "offsetFlushIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component, and can it be set to a custom duration if not required?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetFlushIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component is responsible for specifying the interval at which to attempt committing offsets. By default, this value is set to 60000 milliseconds (1 minute). This option determines how often changes recorded by Debezium are committed, i.e., written to the Kafka topic. It can be set to a custom duration if not required, as the "required" value for this option is false, meaning it''s optional. The group to which this option belongs is "consumer".'
    - question: 'What is the default Java class used for the persistence of Debezium SQL Server connector offsets when the option "offsetStorage" in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component is not explicitly set?'
      answer: |
       'The default Java class used for the persistence of Debezium SQL Server connector offsets, when the "offsetStorage" option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component is not explicitly set, is org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.FileOffsetBackingStore.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "offsetStorageFileName" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-sqlserver" component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageFileName" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-sqlserver" component specifies the path to a file where offsets are stored when the offset.storage is set to the FileOffsetBackingStore. Its default value is null, meaning it''s not configured by default. This option is optional but can be required depending on how you choose to manage the offset storage in your consumer configuration for this component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "offsetStoragePartitions" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver", and is it required? Also, under what conditions should this option be set differently from its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStoragePartitions" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver" determines the number of partitions used when creating the offset storage topic. This setting is only required when the offset.storage is set to the ''KafkaOffsetBackingStore''. By default, this value is not set (null). Under normal circumstances, you might not need to change it from its default value unless you have specific requirements for the number of partitions in your KafkaOffsetBackingStore. However, adjusting this option could be beneficial when dealing with large-scale data processing where optimizing partitioning can improve performance and resource utilization.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "offsetStorageReplicationFactor" option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component, and when is it required?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageReplicationFactor" option in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component determines the replication factor used when creating the offset storage topic. This option is necessary when you set the offset.storage to the KafkaOffsetBackingStore. Its default value is null, and it can be set as an integer. However, its use is optional within the consumer group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "offsetStorageTopic" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver", and is it required? In other words, under what circumstances would you need to specify a Kafka topic name for the offset storage when using this component with the KafkaOffsetBackingStore?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageTopic" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver" is used to specify the name of a Kafka topic where offsets are stored. This is necessary when the "offset.storage" setting is set to the KafkaOffsetBackingStore. By default, it has no predefined value, meaning you''ll need to provide a specific Kafka topic name if you choose to use this feature. You would typically use this option when you want to persist and manage offsets within a Kafka cluster for the debezium-sqlserver component, ensuring consistent offset handling across server restarts or failures.'
    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-sqlserver" component affect its ability to automatically configure JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, and other similar services? Is it necessary for this option to be enabled or disabled when using the debezium-sqlserver component, and what is the default setting for this option?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-sqlserver" component allows it to automatically configure JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, and other similar services. This is because when autowiring is enabled, the component looks for a single instance of matching type in the registry to configure on itself. If you don''t need this automatic configuration, you can disable it by setting the option to false. However, it''s not mandatory to enable or disable this option specifically for using the debezium-sqlserver component. The default value for this option is true.'
    - question: 'What are the available values for the Apache Camel component debezium-sqlserver option called "binaryHandlingMode", and what does each value represent in terms of binary data handling? Also, is it mandatory to provide a value for this option, and if not, what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel component debezium-sqlserver provides an option called "binaryHandlingMode". This option specifies how binary columns should be represented in change events. There are four available values:              1. ''bytes'' (default): represents binary data as byte array.       2. ''base64'': represents binary data as base64-encoded string.       3. ''base64-url-safe'': represents binary data as base64-url-safe-encoded string.       4. ''hex'': represents binary data as hex-encoded (base16) string.              It is not mandatory to provide a value for this option; if no value is provided, it will default to ''bytes''.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and group of the "columnExcludeList" option in the Apache Camel component named "debezium-sqlserver", and is it required?'
      answer: |
       'The "columnExcludeList" option within the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver" serves the purpose of specifying regular expressions matching columns to exclude from change events. Its default value is null, and data type is string. This option is not required, meaning you can choose whether or not to use it. It belongs to the "sqlserver" group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and group of the "columnIncludeList" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver", and is it a required configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "columnIncludeList" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver" serves the purpose of specifying regular expressions that match columns to include in change events. It does not have a default value, and its data type is string. This configuration is optional as it''s marked as "required: false". Lastly, it belongs to the group "sqlserver".'
    - question: 'How should I properly configure the `columnPropagateSourceType` option in the Apache Camel `debezium-sqlserver` component to include regular expressions matching column names that will propagate the original type and original length of those columns to the change records emitted?'
      answer: |
       'To include regular expressions matching column names that will propagate the original type and original length of those columns to the change records emitted by the Apache Camel `debezium-sqlserver` component, you should properly configure the `columnPropagateSourceType` option as a comma-separated list of regular expressions. For example:              ```       columnPropagateSourceType=column1_regex,column2_regex       ```              Replace `column1_regex` and `column2_regex` with your own regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of the desired columns. Keep in mind that this option is optional and its default value is null. To use it effectively, make sure to set it when configuring the `debezium-sqlserver` component within your Apache Camel project.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "converters" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver", and how are custom converters defined and configured when choosing to use them instead of default ones?'
      answer: |
       'The "converters" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver" is an optional configuration that allows you to use custom converters instead of the default ones. This option comes in handy when dealing with data types that are not handled appropriately by the defaults. To define a custom converter, you set its type using the ''.type'' config option. The configuration for this custom converter can be specified using options that follow the ''.'' notation. If you choose to use custom converters, ensure they are correctly configured to meet your specific data transformation needs.'
    - question: 'How can I configure custom metric tags in Apache Camel''s Debezium SQL Server component to add additional labels (tags) to the MBean object name?'
      answer: |
       'To configure custom metric tags in Apache Camel''s Debezium SQL Server component, you can append key-value pairs to the MBean object name. Each key represents a tag for the MBean object name, and the corresponding value is the value of that tag. For instance, if you want to set keys ''k1'' and ''k2'' with values ''v1'' and ''v2'' respectively, you would use the following format: k1=v1,k2=v2. This feature is optional and can be found in the component configuration under the "customMetricTags" option.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "databaseHostname" option in the Apache Camel component named "debezium-sqlserver"? Are there any specific requirements regarding this option, such as being a string type and optional (not required)?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseHostname" option in the Apache Camel component named "debezium-sqlserver" is used to specify the resolvable hostname or IP address of the database server. While it doesn''t have a default value, it can be left null when not explicitly set. This option is of type string and is optional, meaning it is not required for the component to function but may be needed depending on your setup within the "sqlserver" group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and required status of the "databaseInstance" option in the Apache Camel component named "debezium-sqlserver"? Additionally, where does this option belong within the group of options for this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseInstance" option in the Apache Camel component named "debezium-sqlserver" serves to specify the name of your SQL Server instance. By default, it doesn''t have a value (defaultValue: null). This option is data typed as a string (type: string) and isn''t required for use, but if not provided, it will be assumed that the component is connecting to the default SQL Server instance (required: false). Lastly, this option falls under the group of options for the "sqlserver" component within the configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for and is it mandatory to set the "databaseNames" option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component, if not provided, will it capture changes from all databases?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseNames" option in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component does not have a default value. It is an optional setting that allows you to specify the names of the databases from which the connector should capture changes. If not provided, it will not capture changes from all databases by default. Instead, it will only listen for changes on the master database (masterdb) and the tempdb database.'
    - question: 'What is the required type, default value, and description for the Apache Camel component debezium-sqlserver option named "databasePassword"? The required type is string, default value is null, and it describes the password of the database user to be used when connecting to the database.'
      answer: |
       'The "databasePassword" option for the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver" is a required string type, with a default value of null. Its purpose is to provide the password for the database user that will be utilized while connecting to the database.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the optional configuration option "databasePort" in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver"? Also, can you confirm if this option relates to the port number of the database server?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional configuration option "databasePort" in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver" is an integer type with a default value of 1433. Yes, this option does indeed relate to the port number of the database server.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and maximum allowed duration (in milliseconds) for the "databaseQueryTimeoutMs" option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component, and can it be set to a value less than the default if desired?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "databaseQueryTimeoutMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component is 10 minutes (10,000 milliseconds), as indicated by the defaultValue: 10m. However, it can be set to a value less than the default if desired. The maximum allowed duration for this option is 600 seconds (600,000 milliseconds), as described in the "Time to wait for a query to execute" part of its description.'
    - question: 'What is the name of the optional string parameter in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-sqlserver'', which specifies the database user to be used when connecting to the database, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The optional string parameter you''re referring to within the Apache Camel component ''debezium-sqlserver'' is named "databaseUser". Its purpose is to specify the database user to be utilized while connecting to the database. However, it doesn''t have a default value assigned to it.'
    - question: 'What is the difference in data retrieval method when using the ''function'' and ''direct'' values for the `dataQueryMode` option in the Apache Camel component `debezium-sqlserver`, and which value is set as the default?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component `debezium-sqlserver`, the `dataQueryMode` option controls how the connector retrieves Change Data Capture (CDC) data. By default, it''s set to ''function'', which means that the connector queries the data by calling the cdc.fn_cdc_get_all_changes_# function. On the other hand, if you set the value to ''direct'', the connector will instead query the change tables directly. The ''function'' method is the default setting for this option.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "datatypePropagateSourceType" option within the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component, and can it be required or omitted during configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "datatypePropagateSourceType" option in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component is designed to propagate the original data type and length from the source database to the emitted change records. It does this by accepting a comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the specific data type names in the database. The default value for this option is null, meaning it can be omitted during configuration if desired. However, it''s important to note that its requirement during configuration is false, which means it''s not strictly necessary for the component to function.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `decimalHandlingMode` option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver" affect the representation of DECIMAL and NUMERIC columns in change events, and what are the available options for this setting, along with their implications on precision and ease of use in consumers? Is it required to set this option when using the debezium-sqlserver component?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `decimalHandlingMode` option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver" determines how DECIMAL and NUMERIC columns are represented in change events. The available options are ''precise'' (the default), ''string'', and ''double''.              The ''precise'' mode uses `java.math.BigDecimal` to represent values, which are encoded in the change events using a binary representation and Kafka Connect''s ''org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Decimal'' type. This provides high precision but might be more complex for consumers to handle.              The ''string'' mode uses strings to represent values, offering lower precision compared to the ''precise'' mode but with simpler handling in consumers.              Lastly, the ''double'' mode represents values using Java''s ''double'', which may not offer the same level of precision as the other modes, but it will be much easier for consumers to use due to its simplicity.              It is not required to set this option when using the debezium-sqlserver component, as it has a default value of ''precise''. However, depending on your specific requirements regarding precision and ease of use in consumers, you may choose to customize this setting accordingly.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the ''errorsMaxRetries'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component and what happens when this option is set to zero?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the ''errorsMaxRetries'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component is -1, which means there is no limit on retries when connection errors occur. When you set this option to 0, it disables the retries upon connection errors, effectively failing immediately without any retry attempts.'
    - question: 'What are the available options for handling failures during processing of events in Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component, and what is the default value and allowed data type for this option?'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s Debezium SQL Server component, the available options for handling failures during event processing are ''fail'', ''warn'', and ''ignore''. The default value is ''fail'', meaning that an exception indicating the problematic event and its position will be raised, causing the connector to stop. This option type is a string and it can be configured if desired, but it''s not required within the sqlserver group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "heartbeatActionQuery" option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component, and is it mandatory to specify a query for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "heartbeatActionQuery" option within the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component is used to define the query that gets executed with every heartbeat. By default, no query is set ("defaultValue": null) for this option, meaning it won''t automatically execute any query. Specifying a query for this option is optional; you can choose to provide one if desired, but its absence will not prevent the component from functioning.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "heartbeatIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver", and can it be set to disable heartbeat messages?'
      answer: |
       'The "heartbeatIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver" is a duration type that defines an interval, in milliseconds, for sending periodic heartbeat messages to a specified heartbeat topic. By default, it''s set to 0ms, which means that heartbeat messages are disabled. You can manually configure this option to enable heartbeats if needed, but keep in mind that disabling heartbeats is the default behavior.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and optional nature of the "heartbeatTopicsPrefix" option in the Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component, and what purpose does this option serve within the context of this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "heartbeatTopicsPrefix" option in Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component defaults to "__debezium-heartbeat". This option is optional, meaning it can be overridden if needed. Its purpose is to name heartbeat topics, which are used for maintaining connection health between the Debezium connector and the source database (in this case, SQL Server). If not specified, it defaults to "__debezium-heartbeat".'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the ''includeSchemaChanges'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component, and can this option be disabled programmatically?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the ''includeSchemaChanges'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component is to publish changes in the database schema to a Kafka topic. This is set to true by default. However, if you wish to disable this feature programmatically, you can do so as it is an optional setting and accepts boolean values. When disabled, no schema changes will be recorded or published to the Kafka topic.'
    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the "includeSchemaComments" option within the "debezium-sqlserver" component in Apache Camel impact memory usage, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "includeSchemaComments" option within the "debezium-sqlserver" component in Apache Camel can significantly impact memory usage due to the creation of additional String objects for each ColumnImpl. As a result, it''s important to note that this operation could potentially be quite heavy on memory consumption. The default value for this option is set to ''false'', meaning comments are not included by default. However, if you choose to enable it, remember to consider the potential implications on your system''s memory usage.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "incrementalSnapshotAllowSchemaChanges" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver", and are schema changes to primary keys or columns'' default values supported during an incremental snapshot using this setting?'
      answer: |
       'The "incrementalSnapshotAllowSchemaChanges" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver" is designed to detect schema changes during an incremental snapshot, allowing the system to re-select a current chunk and avoid locking DDLs (Data Definition Language statements). However, it''s important to note that changes to primary keys are not supported and can result in incorrect outcomes if performed during an incremental snapshot. Additionally, if a schema change only affects columns'' default values, the change won''t be detected until the DDL is processed from the binlog stream. This doesn''t impact the values of snapshot events, but the schema of snapshot events may have outdated defaults as a result. The default value for this option is false, and it''s worth noting that it''s an optional setting under the "sqlserver" group in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the optional configuration parameter "incrementalSnapshotChunkSize" in Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component, and what kind of group does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The optional configuration parameter "incrementalSnapshotChunkSize" in Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component has a default value of 1024 (an integer). This parameter controls the maximum size of chunk (number of documents/rows) for incremental snapshotting. It is not required, but belongs to the sqlserver group.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `incrementalSnapshotOptionRecompile` option to true in the Apache Camel `debezium-sqlserver` component affect the incremental snapshot process, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `incrementalSnapshotOptionRecompile` option to true in the Apache Camel `debezium-sqlserver` component adds `OPTION(RECOMPILE)` on each SELECT statement during the incremental snapshot process. This prevents parameter sniffing but can cause CPU pressure on the source database. The default value of this option is false, and it belongs to the sqlserver group in Camel configuration.'
    - question: 'What are the possible values for the `incrementalSnapshotWatermarkingStrategy` option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component, and what is the effect of using ''insert_delete'' as opposed to the default value ''INSERT_INSERT'' when watermarking during an incremental snapshot?'
      answer: |
       'The `incrementalSnapshotWatermarkingStrategy` option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component can take two values: ''INSERT_INSERT'' (default) and ''insert_delete''. The default value, ''INSERT_INSERT'', specifies that both an open and a close signal will be written into the signal data collection. On the other hand, using ''insert_delete'' only writes an open signal on the signal data collection, with the close being indicated by deleting the corresponding open signal from the collection.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the optional configuration option `maxBatchSize` in the Apache Camel component `debezium-sqlserver`, and can this option be considered as a required setting?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional configuration option `maxBatchSize` in the Apache Camel component `debezium-sqlserver` is an integer of 2048. This option specifies the maximum size of each batch of source records, but it''s not a required setting.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "maxIterationTransactions" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver", and what is its default value, data type, and whether it''s required or not?'
      answer: |
       'The "maxIterationTransactions" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver" is designed to minimize the connector''s memory usage when changes are being streamed from multiple tables within a database. Its default value is 500, and it belongs to the integer data type. While not required, you can configure this property to suit your specific needs if necessary, as part of the "sqlserver" group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the maxQueueSize option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component and why is it recommended to set this value larger than the maximum batch size?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `maxQueueSize` option in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component is 8192. This setting controls the maximum size of the queue for change events read from the database log but not yet recorded or forwarded. It''s recommended to set this value larger than the maximum batch size because as the queue fills up, new events will be held in memory until there is space available. If the maxQueueSize is smaller than the maximum batch size, it may lead to event loss due to overflow when processing large amounts of change data quickly.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type, as well as whether it''s required for the "maxQueueSizeInBytes" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver"? And can you explain what this option does in terms of change events processing?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "maxQueueSizeInBytes" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver" is 0, which means the feature is not enabled by default. This option represents the maximum size of the queue in bytes for change events read from the database log but not yet recorded or forwarded. When set to a value other than 0, it specifies the limit beyond which the component will pause processing until the queue size decreases below the specified limit. This helps in managing memory usage when dealing with a large number of change events.'

      answer: |
       'The primary difference between the ''initial_only'' and ''initial'' options for the snapshotMode setting in the debezium-sqlserver component of Apache Camel lies in their behavior after running a snapshot upon connector startup.              In the ''initial'' mode (default), the connector performs a snapshot to capture the current full state of the configured tables, then begins streaming changes from the transaction log. This is suitable when you want the initial sync to include data as well as subsequent change events.              On the other hand, the ''initial_only'' option also takes a snapshot but stops afterward and does not stream changes from the transaction log. This could be useful in scenarios where you only need an initial load of data without further updates or when starting the connector for one-time data migration.'

      answer: |
       'To configure the `snapshotSelectStatementOverrides` option for the Debezium SQL Server connector, you should follow these steps:              1. Define a comma-separated list of fully-qualified tables (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME or SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME) in the `snapshotSelectStatementOverrides` property. For example:              ```       "snapshotSelectStatementOverrides": "db1.table1, db2.table2"       ```              2. Set the select statement for each table using the corresponding configuration properties. The property names have the following format: `''snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME''` or `''snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME''`. For instance, to specify a select statement for table db1.table1, use the configuration property:              ```       "snapshot.select.statement.overrides.db1.table1": "SELECT * FROM db1.table1 WHERE column_name > last_value"       ```              You would do the same for table2 in your example, using `''snapshot.select.statement.overrides.db2.table2''`.              Remember that you can use these properties to resume snapshotting after an interruption by setting a specific point where to start reading data from the tables.              Hope this helps!

The ''adaptive'' mode uses the database column''s precision to determine the precision of the values. The ''adaptive_time_microseconds'' mode functions like ''adaptive'', but TIME fields always use microsecond precision. Lastly, the ''connect'' mode consistently represents time, date, and timestamp values using Kafka Connect''s built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which employs millisecond precision regardless of the database columns'' precision. The default value for this option is ''adaptive''.'
    - question: 'In relation to the Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component, could you explain the purpose and implications of setting the "tombstonesOnDelete" option to true or false in terms of how delete operations are represented in Kafka and whether it affects the complete deletion of events pertaining to a given key?'
      answer: |
       'In relation to the Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component, setting the "tombstonesOnDelete" option to true means that delete operations will be represented by both a delete event and a subsequent tombstone event in Kafka. On the other hand, if set to false, only a delete event will be emitted. The default behavior is to emit tombstone events, which allows Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to a given key once the source record has been deleted. If you choose not to use tombstones (by setting "tombstonesOnDelete" to false), you might need to implement additional logic to ensure that the deletion of events in Kafka matches the state of your SQL Server data.'

To use this option effectively with Kafka Connect and Debezium engine, you should prefix properties with "additionalProperties." followed by the property name.              For example, to set a transactional ID (transactional.id) or a schema registry URL (schema.registry.url), you could do so as follows:       - For transactional ID: additionalProperties.transactional.id=12345       - For schema registry URL: additionalProperties.schema.registry.url=http://localhost:8811/avro              These properties can be included in the configuration for the "debezium-sqlserver" component in your Apache Camel application as regular query parameters, ensuring that your Debezium engine functions correctly with Kafka Connect.'
    - question: 'What is the default Converter class used for serializing and deserializing key data for offsets in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component, if the internalKeyConverter option is not explicitly set, and which type of converter does it belong to (e.g., JSON)?'
      answer: |
       'The default Converter class used for serializing and deserializing key data for offsets in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component, when the internalKeyConverter option is not explicitly set, is org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter, which belongs to the JSON type of converters.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "internalValueConverter" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver", and what class or type should be used as its value if a custom converter other than the default JSON converter is desired?'
      answer: |
       'The "internalValueConverter" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver" is responsible for serializing and deserializing value data for offsets. By default, it uses a JSON converter. If you wish to use a custom converter other than the default JSON converter, you should provide a class or type of your choice as its value. For instance, if you have a custom converter class named "MyCustomConverter", you would set the "internalValueConverter" to "org.yournamespace.MyCustomConverter". This option falls under the consumer group and can be left as an optional setting if you''re content with using the default JSON converter.'
    - question: 'What are the possible values for the debezium-sqlserver''s offsetCommitPolicy option in Apache Camel, and can it be set to use a custom Java class that implements OffsetCommitPolicy interface? Additionally, how is the default value of this option configured when not explicitly set by the user?'
      answer: |
       'The `debezium-sqlserver`''s `offsetCommitPolicy` option in Apache Camel can take a string value representing the name of a Java class that implements the ''OffsetCommitPolicy'' interface. This class defines when offset commits should be triggered based on the number of events processed and the time elapsed since the last commit. The default value for this option is set to use a periodic commit policy based upon time intervals, which means that commits are triggered at regular time intervals.              When not explicitly set by the user, the default Java class for the `offsetCommitPolicy` option follows the default periodic commit policy implementation. However, you can customize this behavior by providing a custom Java class that implements the ''OffsetCommitPolicy'' interface and assigning it to the `offsetCommitPolicy` option. This allows you to tailor the offset committing strategy to your specific use case or requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum duration (in milliseconds) that the debezium-sqlserver component in Apache Camel waits for records to flush and partition offset data to be committed to offset storage before cancelling the process, as specified by the offsetCommitTimeoutMs option, and what is its default value?

      answer: |
       'The maximum duration that the debezium-sqlserver component in Apache Camel waits for records to flush and partition offset data to be committed to offset storage before cancelling the process is specified by the offsetCommitTimeoutMs option, with a default value of 5000 milliseconds (or 5 seconds). If this setting is not required, it can be left as false in the configuration to allow the default behavior. However, if you wish to set a specific duration other than the default, you may do so by providing a suitable integer value for offsetCommitTimeoutMs in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "offsetFlushIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel component named "debezium-sqlserver", and can it be configured to work without?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetFlushIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel component named "debezium-sqlserver" is set to a default value of 60000 milliseconds, which translates to 1 minute. This option determines the interval at which to attempt committing offsets. In other words, it controls how often Debezium records the progress of data consumption from an SQL Server database. While it''s not required, configuring it to work without would mean that the offset commit would only occur when the consumer process is explicitly stopped or restarted, potentially leading to issues such as duplicated data processing if the consumer is running for a long time without interruption.'
    - question: 'What is the default Java class responsible for the persistence of Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component''s connector offsets, and is it required to be set explicitly when using this component?'
      answer: |

       'The "offsetStorageTopic" option in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component is used to specify the name of the Kafka topic where offsets are stored when the `offset.storage` is set to the KafkaOffsetBackingStore. It''s optional, meaning it''s not required if you''re using a different method for managing offsets. If no value is provided, there is no default behavior for this option, so you would need to explicitly define a topic for storing offsets in such cases.'
    - question: 'How does the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component function, and under what conditions is it possible for this option to be enabled?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component enables bridging the consumer to the routing Error Handler, which means any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages will be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. However, this option can only be enabled if the third-party component allows Camel to be alerted when an exception was thrown. Some components handle exceptions internally and therefore bridgeErrorHandler is not possible for them. In situations where it''s possible, we may improve the Camel component to hook into the third-party component for future releases. By default, if the bridgeErrorHandler is not enabled, the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, which will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.'
    - question: 'Given the information you''ve provided, here''s a question that can be answered using it:              "What is the purpose of the ''exceptionHandler'' option in the Apache Camel ''debezium-sqlserver'' component and what happens when no custom ExceptionHandler is provided?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''exceptionHandler'' option in the Apache Camel ''debezium-sqlserver'' component allows you to use a custom ExceptionHandler.

    - question: 'How does the "incrementalSnapshotAllowSchemaChanges" option in the Apache Camel debezium-sqlserver component function, and what are its limitations when set to true? Is it recommended to enable this option if a primary key change is possible during an incremental snapshot?'
      answer: |
       'The "incrementalSnapshotAllowSchemaChanges" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-SQLServer component allows it to detect schema changes during an incremental snapshot, thereby resuming the current chunk to prevent locking of DDLs. However, alterations to a primary key are not supported, and they can lead to incorrect results if executed during an incremental snapshot.              Another limitation is that if a schema change only affects column default values, it won''t be detected until the DDL is processed from the binlog stream. This doesn''t impact the snapshot events'' values, but the schema of snapshot events may have outdated defaults.              Given these limitations, it is not advisable to enable this option if a primary key change is possible during an incremental snapshot, as it could result in errors or inconsistencies in your data replication process.'

    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "incrementalSnapshotOptionRecompile" option in the Apache Camel''s Debezium-SQLServer component, and under what circumstances might it be beneficial or detrimental to enable this feature?'
      answer: |
       'The "incrementalSnapshotOptionRecompile" option in the Apache Camel''s Debezium-SQLServer component is designed to add OPTION(RECOMPILE) on each SELECT statement during the incremental snapshot process. This option prevents parameter sniffing, which can lead to suboptimal query plans based on the first execution of a query with a given set of parameters. However, enabling this feature can cause CPU pressure on the source database as each SELECT statement is recompiled for every execution. The default value of this boolean option is false, and it''s recommended to enable it in situations where parameter sniffing is causing performance issues, but keep in mind that it may increase CPU usage on the source database.'
    - question: 'What are the possible values for the `incrementalSnapshotWatermarkingStrategy` option in the Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component, and how does each value behave regarding the open and close signals in the signal data collection? Also, what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The `incrementalSnapshotWatermarkingStrategy` option in Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component can take two values: ''insert_insert'' (default) and ''insert_delete''.              The ''insert_insert'' strategy writes both the open and close signal into the signal data collection. This means that when a snapshot is taken, both the start (open) and end (close) of the changeset will be recorded in the signal data collection.              On the other hand, the ''insert_delete'' strategy only writes the open signal on the signal data collection. The close signal for a given open signal will be marked by deleting the relative open signal from the signal data collection at a later time. This approach allows for efficient handling of changesets where multiple operations (inserts, updates, and deletes) may occur within a single transaction or snapshot.              The default value for this option is ''insert_insert''.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the optional configuration property "maxBatchSize" in the Apache Camel Debezium-SQLServer component, and what group of configurations does it belong to?'

      answer: |
       'The "maxIterationTransactions" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-sqlserver" is designed to optimize memory usage when changes are being streamed from multiple tables within a database. This property allows you to set an upper limit on the number of transactions processed before the connector performs a flush, thereby reducing its memory footprint. The default value for this option is 500 (an integer). It''s important to note that it is not a required configuration parameter, meaning it can be left unset if desired. This option falls under the configuration groups specifically for the "sqlserver" connector.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the maxQueueSize option in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component, and in what scenarios would adjusting this value be necessary?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `maxQueueSize` option in the Apache Camel Debezium SQL Server component is 8192 (eight thousand, one hundred ninety-two). This option sets the maximum size of the queue for change events read from the database log but not yet recorded or forwarded. If you find that the rate of incoming change events exceeds the capacity to process them before they are removed from the queue, adjusting the `maxQueueSize` value could help improve performance by allowing a larger buffer for events. However, it''s essential to ensure that the new value is always larger than the maximum batch size to prevent overflow situations.'

    - question: 'What is the format and purpose of the "messageKeyColumns" option in the Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component, and how can you customize it to specify a specific combination of table and column(s) as the message key?'
      answer: |
       'The "messageKeyColumns" option in Apache Camel''s Debezium-SQLServer component is a string format that allows you to specify a semicolon-separated list of expressions for fully-qualified tables and column(s) to be used as message key. Each expression follows the pattern ''(DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME)|(SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME)'', depending on the specific connector, and the key columns are a comma-separated list of columns representing the custom key. If no explicit key configuration is provided for a table, its primary key column(s) will be used as message key.              To customize it, you can specify a combination of table and column(s) from your database as the message key by providing the fully-qualified table name and the desired column(s) separated by commas in the "messageKeyColumns" option. For example, if you have two tables ''dbserver1.inventory.orderlines'' and ''dbserver1.inventory.orders'', and you want to use ''orderId'' from ''orderlines'' and ''id'' from ''orders'' as the message key, you can set "messageKeyColumns" to "dbserver1.inventory.orderlines:orderId;dbserver1.inventory.orders:id".'

      answer: |
       'The "snapshotIsolationMode" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-SQLServer component controls the transaction isolation level used and the type of lock acquired on captured tables during a snapshot operation. It has several modes, including ''repeatable_read'', ''exclusive'', ''snapshot'', ''read_committed'', and ''read_uncommitted''.              The default mode is ''repeatable_read'', which uses the repeatable read isolation level and acquires locks depending on the snapshot.locking.mode property. In this mode, the connector prevents any reads and updates for all captured tables during the entire snapshot duration when ''exclusive'' is specified. On the other hand, it guarantees snapshot consistency only during the initial snapshot in SNAPSHOT isolation level when ''snapshot'' is specified.              When the ''read_committed'' mode is used, the connector runs the initial snapshot in READ COMMITTED isolation level, and no long-running locks are taken to allow other transactions to update table rows. However, snapshot consistency is not guaranteed.              Lastly, when using ''read_uncommitted'' mode, neither table nor row-level locks are acquired, but the connector does not guarantee snapshot consistency.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and maximum duration allowed for the debezium-sqlserver option named "snapshotLockTimeoutMs" in Apache Camel, and can it be set to a custom duration if not acquired within this timeframe?'

    - question: 'What are the available options for the `snapshotMode` configuration in Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component and what is the default value, as well as a brief description of each option''s behavior?'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s debezium-sqlserver component, the `snapshotMode` configuration has three available options: ''initial'' (default), ''initial_only'', and ''schema_only''. The ''initial'' option causes the connector to run a snapshot at startup if no offsets are detected for the logical server name, capturing the full state of the configured tables. After the snapshot completes, the connector begins streaming changes from the transaction log. If you choose ''initial_only'', the connector will perform a snapshot like it does for the ''initial'' option but will stop after the snapshot is completed and not stream changes from the transaction log. Lastly, the ''schema_only'' option causes the connector to run a snapshot that captures only the schema (table structures) but not any table data at startup if no offsets are detected for the logical server name. After the snapshot completes, the connector begins to stream changes from the transaction log.'

    - question: 'How can I customize the SQL statement used during snapshotting for a specific table when using the debezium-sqlserver component in Apache Camel, and what is the purpose of setting a custom snapshotSelectStatementOverrides for large append-only tables?'
      answer: |
       'To customize the SQL statement used during snapshotting for a specific table when using the `debezium-sqlserver` component in Apache Camel, you can use the `snapshotSelectStatementOverrides` option. This property takes a comma-separated list of fully-qualified tables (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME or SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME). Each table is then configured with its specific select statement using properties identified by ''snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME'' or ''snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME'', respectively. The value of these properties is the select statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting.              A possible use case for large append-only tables is setting a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting, in case a previous snapshotting was interrupted. This allows you to control the starting position and potentially reduce the amount of data being processed during initial or resumed snapshots.'
