    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "oAuthAPI" option in the Apache Camel Zeebe component and where should its value (if provided) represent the authorization server''s URL from which an access token will be requested? Is providing a value for this option optional or required, and what type of data should it hold?'
      answer: |
       'The "oAuthAPI" option in the Apache Camel Zeebe component is designed to specify the authorization server''s URL from which an access token will be requested, if needed for authentication purposes. Its value represents the endpoint where the client can initiate the OAuth flow to acquire an access token. Providing a value for this option is optional, as it might not always be necessary depending on the use case and security requirements. The data type of this option is a string.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel Zeebe component affect error handling for incoming messages, compared to its default behavior when this option is not set?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel Zeebe component allows for a more sophisticated approach to error handling for incoming messages. Instead of the consumer using the built-in org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to log exceptions at WARN or ERROR level and ignore them, any exceptions that occur during message pickup will be treated as messages and handled by the Camel routing Error Handler. This ensures a more streamlined error handling process for your application. However, it''s important to note that this feature is only applicable if the third-party component supports notifying Camel when an exception has been thrown. When this option is not set, the behavior defaults to the standard exception handling by Camel.'
    - question: 'Given the information you provided, here''s a question about the Apache Camel component Zeebe and its option "lazyStartProducer":              "What is the purpose of the ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Apache Camel Zeebe component, and under what circumstances might it be beneficial to set this option to true?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Apache Camel Zeebe component is designed to control whether the producer should be started lazily (on the first message). This can be advantageous when a producer may potentially fail during initial startup, causing the entire route to fail being started. By deferring the startup until the first message is processed, any issues with creating and starting the producer can be handled within Camel''s routing error handlers. However, be aware that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take a little time and thereby prolong the total processing time of the process.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Zeebe component affect the configuration process and what is its default value when not explicitly specified?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Zeebe component allows for automatic autowiring of options, making it easier to configure components like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc., by searching the registry for a single instance of matching type. This feature is optional, with a default value of true when not explicitly specified. When this option is enabled, you don''t need to manually configure these components, as they will be automatically configured based on the available instances in the registry.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientId" option in the Apache Camel zeebe component, and is this option required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option in the Apache Camel Zeebe component is used to specify a client id for requesting an access token from the OAuth authorization server during communication. It''s important for security purposes. By default, there is no predefined value for the "clientId". This option is optional and not necessarily required.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it''s mandatory or optional for the `clientSecret` option in the Apache Camel Zeebe client when using OAuth authorization server?'
      answer: |
       'The `clientSecret` option in the Apache Camel Zeebe client, when using an OAuth authorization server, is a string used to provide a secret key for requesting an access token. It does not have a default value and its usage is optional, but it is categorized under security group due to its sensitive nature.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "gatewayHost" option in the Apache Camel component "zeebe", and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option? Also, which group does this option belong to in terms of its functionality or purpose?'
      answer: |
       'The "gatewayHost" option in the Apache Camel component "zeebe" has a default value of "localhost" and is of data type "string". Providing a value for this option is not mandatory as it specifies the gateway server hostname to connect to the Zeebe cluster. This option belongs to the security group, indicating its purpose or functionality in terms of secure communication with the Zeebe cluster.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the optional Apache Camel component "zeebe" option called "gatewayPort", which refers to the gateway server port for connecting to a Zeeb cluster, and under what group is this configuration parameter typically found in terms of security?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional Apache Camel component "zeebe" option called "gatewayPort" is an integer 26500. This option refers to the gateway server port for connecting to a Zeebe cluster. In terms of security, this configuration parameter is typically found under the "security" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "formatJSON" option within the Apache Camel Zeebe component, and is it a required setting?'
      answer: |
       'The "formatJSON" option within the Apache Camel Zeebe component is designed to format the result in the body as JSON. Its default value is false. This setting is not required, meaning you can opt to use or skip it based on your specific needs, and it falls under the common settings group in the Zeebe component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "jobKey" option in the Apache Camel Zeebe component, and is it a required parameter or can it be omitted?'
      answer: |
       'The "jobKey" option in the Apache Camel Zeebe component serves as a unique identifier for jobs that are being processed by the job worker. It''s not mandatory to provide this value as its default is null. However, when specified, it helps in tracking and managing individual jobs within the context of the consumer group.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the Apache Camel Zeebe component option named "timeout", and is it required to be specified when using the consumer group? Additionally, could you explain what the purpose of this option is within the context of the Zeebe job worker?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel Zeebe component option named "timeout" is an integer with a value of 10. This option is not required, meaning it can be omitted when using the consumer group. The purpose of the "timeout" option within the context of the Zeebe job worker is to set a timeout for jobs being processed by the worker. If a job does not complete within the specified time, it will be terminated and marked as failed.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the Apache Camel Zeebe component to bridge exceptions thrown by the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, instead of using the default ExceptionHandler? Is it possible for this configuration in the current release or should we expect this feature to be available in future releases?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel Zeebe component to bridge exceptions thrown by the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, you can set the "bridgeErrorHandler" option to true. However, this is only possible if the third-party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. If the component handles exceptions internally, this configuration is not possible in the current release. For future releases, there might be improvements to the Camel component that will hook into the third-party component and make this possible. By default, the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler, which logs exceptions at WARN or ERROR level and ignores them.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the exceptionHandler option within the Apache Camel Zeebe component, when it comes to handling errors during message processing, and how can a custom ExceptionHandler be utilized with this option, considering that if bridgeErrorHandler is enabled, this option will not be in use? Also, what is the default behavior of this option, and under which configuration group (consumer or consumer advanced) does the exceptionHandler option belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The `exceptionHandler` option within the Apache Camel Zeebe component serves to allow consumers to utilize a custom ExceptionHandler during message processing. If the `bridgeErrorHandler` is enabled, this option will not be in operation. By default, the component handles exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. However, when you set the `exceptionHandler`, these exceptions will be handled according to your custom logic instead. This option belongs to the advanced configuration group under the consumer section.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel Zeebe component under the consumer (advanced) group, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel Zeebe component, found under the advanced consumer group, is an optional setting that defines the exchange pattern when a consumer creates an exchange. By default, it has no specified value, meaning you can set it according to your specific use case. This option helps determine how data flows between producer and consumer in a message-oriented middleware scenario. When not provided explicitly, Camel will use its default behavior, which usually is "InOnly" for consumer exchanges.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel component Zeebe option named "lazyStartProducer", and under what circumstances might it be beneficial to enable this feature?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel component Zeebe option named "lazyStartProducer" determines whether the producer should be started lazily (on the first message). This can be beneficial in scenarios where a producer may otherwise fail during startup, causing the route to fail being started. By deferring the producer''s startup to be lazy, you can handle the startup failure during routing messages via Camel''s error handlers. However, please note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer might take additional time, which could prolong the total processing time of the route. The default value for this option is false. It falls under the "producer (advanced)" group.'
