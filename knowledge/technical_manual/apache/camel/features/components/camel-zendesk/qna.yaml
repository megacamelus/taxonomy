seed_examples:
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the "serverUrl" option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component, and is it required when configuring this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "serverUrl" option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component serves as the URL to connect to your Zendesk server. By default, it does not have a value assigned (defaultValue: null). This option is not required when configuring this component, meaning you can omit it if you have specified the Zendesk server URL elsewhere in your configuration or if you are using the default connection settings provided by Apache Camel. However, it''s essential to note that setting an explicit server URL can enhance flexibility and ensure correct connection to your specific Zendesk instance when using this component.'
    - question: 'How does the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component function, and under what conditions is it possible for this feature to be utilized? Additionally, if a message cannot be processed due to an exception, how will the consumer handle such instances by default, without using the bridgeErrorHandler?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component allows for bridging errors from the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages will be treated as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. However, this feature is only possible if the third-party component allows Camel to be notified of an exception being thrown. Some components handle exceptions internally, making it impossible to use bridgeErrorHandler.              In instances where the bridgeErrorHandler is not utilized, the consumer will defaults to using the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler. Exceptions encountered during message processing will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored by default.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component affect the behavior of the producer, and when is it beneficial to use this feature?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component allows the producer to be started on-demand (when the first message arrives rather than during the initial startup). This can be beneficial when a producer may otherwise fail during starting, preventing the route from being successfully initiated. In such situations, deferring the startup failure to be handled during routing messages ensures that the overall system remains stable. However, it''s important to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer might take additional time, potentially prolonging the total processing time of the processing.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component impact the configuration process, and is there a default value for this option when it is not explicitly specified?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component allows for automatic autowiring of options. This means that if an option is marked as autowired, the component will look up in the registry to find a single instance of matching type. If found, this instance gets configured on the Zendesk component. This can be particularly useful for automatically configuring data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, and similar resources. The default value for this option is true, meaning that autowiring is enabled by default. However, you can choose to disable it if needed. This advanced configuration setting is designed to simplify the process of configuring these options within your Apache Camel project.'
    - question: 'What is the default configuration and whether it is required for using the Apache Camel Zendesk component if one decides not to specify any configuration options (i.e., grouped under ''advanced'') in their setup?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel Zendesk component doesn''t have a default configuration when you decide not to specify any options, as indicated by the "defaultValue": null in your provided information. However, it''s important to note that the component''s configuration is optional, meaning you can choose to set it up without providing any specific configurations (grouped under ''advanced''). But remember, configuring this component can provide better control over how your Camel routes interact with Zendesk.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and optional configuration of the Apache Camel component "zendesk" option named "zendesk", specifically when setting up a shared Zendesk instance?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel component "zendesk" with the option "zendesk" is designed for using a shared Zendesk instance in your integration setup. Although not required, you can configure it if you wish to do so, under the advanced settings group. This configuration provides a way to connect to a common Zendesk support platform where multiple users collaborate on handling customer service tickets. The specifics of the configuration will depend on the details of your shared Zendesk instance, and no default values are provided for this optional setup.'
    - question: 'How do I set or provide an optional OAuth token for authentication when using the Apache Camel Zendesk component? Is there a default value and is it required?'
      answer: |
       'To set or provide an optional OAuth token for authentication when using the Apache Camel Zendesk component, you can specify the "oauthToken" option. This token is not mandatory and does not have a default value. The group under which this setting falls is "security". If you choose to use it, you should ensure that the provided token is secure.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, required status, and applicable group for the Apache Camel Zendesk component option named "password"?'
      answer: |
       'The "password" option within the Apache Camel Zendesk component serves as a placeholder for a string representing a password. It has no default value (defaultValue: null). Its data type is a string ("type": "string"). The requirement to provide this value is optional ("required": false). Lastly, it falls under the category of security-related options ("groups":"security").'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, required status, and associated group of the "token" option within the Apache Camel component named "zendesk" in terms of security?'
      answer: |
       'The "token" option within the Zendesk component in Apache Camel is a string type that serves as a security token. Its purpose is to provide authentication when interacting with Zendesk. It has no default value, meaning it must be provided explicitly. While not required, it falls under the "security" group of options due to its role in maintaining secure connections between your application and Zendesk.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it is required for the "username" option in the Apache Camel component named "zendesk" under the "security" group?'
      answer: |
       'The "username" option in the Zendesk component within the security group is a string type data field that describes the user name. It does not have a default value and is not required, meaning it can be left empty if necessary.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, requirement status, and group association of the Apache Camel Zendesk component option named "inBody"?'
      answer: |
       'The "inBody" option within the Apache Camel Zendesk component is designed to set a parameter name for passing data in the exchange In Body. Its default value is null, meaning it does not have a predefined value. This option accepts string data types and its requirement status is optional, which means it can be used but is not necessary for the operation of the component. The "inBody" option falls under the common group association, indicating that it is a widely applicable feature across various functionalities of this component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it''s required for the "serverUrl" option found in the Apache Camel component named "zendesk"?'
      answer: |
       'The "serverUrl" option in the Zendesk component of Apache Camel is a string type configuration property that specifies the URL to connect to. It does not have a default value (defaultValue: null). Whether it''s required or not, it can be set at your discretion as it has a false "required" value (required: false), under the group "common".'
    - question: 'In Apache Camel''s Zendesk component, what is the purpose and default value of the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option available in the consumer group?'
      answer: |
       'The "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in Apache Camel''s Zendesk component, found within the consumer group, serves the purpose of allowing you to send an empty message (no body) if the polling consumer did not retrieve any files during its idle period. Its default value is false, meaning that it does not send an empty message when not polling any files by default. However, you can enable this option as per your needs.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Zendesk component in Apache Camel to bridge exceptions thrown by the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, rather than using the default ExceptionHandler? Is it possible with the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Zendesk component configuration, and if so, how do I enable it?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Zendesk component in Apache Camel to bridge exceptions thrown by the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, you can use the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Zendesk component configuration. You need to set its value to true. Here is an example:              ```xml       <route>           ...           <component ref="zendesk">               <property name="bridgeErrorHandler" value="true"/>               ...           </component>           ...       </route>       ```              Enabling the "bridgeErrorHandler" option allows any exceptions that occur while the Zendesk consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages to be processed as a message and handled by the Camel routing Error Handler. If this option is not available in your specific 3rd party component, the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler by default, which logs exceptions at WARN or ERROR level and ignores them.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the exceptionHandler option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component, when does it not apply, and what is its default value? Furthermore, where can this option be found within the groups of consumer settings, and is there a way to customize the behavior of exceptions handled by this option?'
      answer: |
       'The exceptionHandler option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component allows you to use a custom ExceptionHandler. This option is not applicable when the bridgeErrorHandler is enabled. By default, the component will handle exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. You can find this option within the "consumer (advanced)" groups of settings in the configuration. To customize the behavior of exceptions handled by this option, you would need to provide a custom ExceptionHandler implementation.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component under the "consumer (advanced)" group, and is it required or optional when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component is an optional configuration setting that defines the exchange pattern when a consumer creates an exchange. Its default value is null, meaning no specific exchange pattern is set if not defined explicitly. This option is particularly useful within the "consumer (advanced)" group for customizing how data flows between the producer and consumer in your Camel routing setup, when interacting with Zendesk.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component, and can it be configured with a custom implementation for controlling error handling during poll operations before an Exchange has been created and routed in Camel? Additionally, does it have a default value and is its configuration considered an advanced feature grouped under ''consumer (advanced)''?'
      answer: |
       'The `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component allows you to provide a custom implementation for controlling error handling during poll operations before an Exchange has been created and routed in Camel. This is a pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy, which means it can be configured according to your specific needs. However, there is no default value set for this option. Its configuration is considered an advanced feature, grouped under ''consumer (advanced)''.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Zendesk component of Apache Camel affect the behavior of the producer, and under what circumstances might it be beneficial to use this feature?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Zendesk component of Apache Camel allows for a gradual start-up of the producer. This can be particularly useful when the producer may otherwise fail during the starting process, causing the route to fail as well. By deferring the startup to be lazy, the initial failure can be handled more flexibly throughCamel''s routing error handlers during message processing. However, it''s important to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take slightly longer, which could prolong the total processing time of the system. This feature might be beneficial in scenarios where ensuring a successful startup of the entire system is more important than an immediate start of the producer.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component, and is it mandatory to set a value for this option when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component is designed to specify the number of subsequent error polls that should occur before the backoffMultipler kicks in, which adjusts the retry delay based on the failure count. By default, this value is not set ("defaultValue": null), meaning it can be either provided or left unset when using this component. It''s important to note that setting a value for "backoffErrorThreshold" is not mandatory; its presence primarily provides fine-grained control over error retry behavior in the context of the scheduler group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component under the scheduler group, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component falls under the "scheduler" group. Its purpose is to define the number of subsequent idle polls that should occur before the "backoffMultiplier" should be applied. By default, this option has no specified value, meaning it can take any integer value based on your specific use case. Providing a value for this option is not mandatory.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel Zendesk component''s "backoffMultiplier" option, and how does it interact with the "backoffIdleThreshold" and/or "backoffErrorThreshold" options when configured? Also, what is the default value for this option and under which groups is it typically found?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffMultiplier" option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component is designed to allow the scheduled polling consumer to temporarily back off if there have been a specified number of idle or error events consecutively. This multiplier determines the number of polls that will be skipped before the next attempt is made again.              When you configure "backoffMultiplier," it''s essential to also set either "backoffIdleThreshold" or "backoffErrorThreshold." The "backoffIdleThreshold" specifies the number of idle events (when no response is received from Zendesk) before backoff starts, while "backoffErrorThreshold" refers to the number of error events (e.g., network errors, authentication errors) before backoff begins.              The default value for "backoffMultiplier" is null, meaning it doesn''t have a predefined value and can be set as desired. This option falls under the "scheduler" groups in the component configuration, indicating that it primarily pertains to managing the timing and execution of scheduled tasks or polling consumers.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the "delay" option in Apache Camel''s Zendesk component to set a specific interval (in milliseconds) between polling calls, from its default value of 500 milliseconds?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the "delay" option in Apache Camel''s Zendesk component and set a specific interval (in milliseconds) between polling calls beyond its default value of 500 milliseconds, you can modify the configuration as follows:              Set the property "zendeskDelay" to your desired delay value (in milliseconds) in the component''s configuration. Here''s an example:              ```xml       <component class="org.apache.camel.component.zendesk.ZendeskComponent">           <propertyName>zendeskDelay</propertyName>           <value>Your-desired-delay-value-in-milliseconds</value>           ...       </component>       ```              Ensure that the property "zendeskDelay" is included under the "scheduler" group, as it''s optional and only applicable in that context. For instance:              ```xml       <groups>           <group ref="scheduler"/>       </groups>       ```              Replace "Your-desired-delay-value-in-milliseconds" with the desired interval you wish to set between polling calls, and adjust the configuration as per your specific use case.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component affect the behavior of the ScheduledPollConsumer? Specifically, when is it set to run immediately again after a previous run?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component allows the ScheduledPollConsumer to run immediately again if the previous run polled one or more messages. This means that if new messages are available during a poll, the consumer will not wait for the scheduled interval but will execute immediately, fetching those new messages without delay. If "greedy" is not enabled, the consumer will follow the scheduled interval regardless of whether there are new messages or not.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the initialDelay option in the Apache Camel component Zendesk, and is it required for configuration? Also, can you tell me which group this option belongs to within the scheduler?'
      answer: |
       'The "initialDelay" option in the Zendesk component of Apache Camel has a default value of 1000 milliseconds (ms). Its data type is integer. This option is not required for configuration, meaning you can choose to set it or omit it during your setup process. Lastly, this option belongs to the "scheduler" group within the component''s settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and possible maximum limit for the "repeatCount" option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component when used within the scheduler, and how can it be configured to stop firing after a specific number of times? Additionally, what happens if this option is set to zero or negative values?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the Zendesk component within the Apache Camel scheduler, the default behavior for the "repeatCount" option is infinite, meaning it will continue firing indefinitely. However, you can configure this option to limit the number of times it fires by setting a specific integer value. For instance, if you set it to 5, the scheduler will only fire five times. It''s important to note that if you set the "repeatCount" option to zero or negative values, it will essentially remove any limit on the number of times the scheduler fires, effectively setting it to fire forever.'
    - question: 'What is the default logging level for the "start/complete" logs generated by the Apache Camel Zendesk component''s consumer, and what options are available to configure this logging level?'
      answer: |
       'The default logging level for the "start/complete" logs generated by the Apache Camel Zendesk component''s consumer is TRACE. You can configure this logging level using the "runLoggingLevel" option. This option is available within the scheduler group of settings, allowing you to customize the logging level based on your specific needs.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the custom or shared thread pool for the Zendesk component''s consumer using the scheduledExecutorService option in Apache Camel? And, is it mandatory to provide a value for this option when using the Zendesk component?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom or shared thread pool for the Zendesk component''s consumer using the `scheduledExecutorService` option in Apache Camel, you can set up an object with appropriate properties such as corePoolSize, maximumPoolSize, keepAliveTime, unit, etc., according to your use case. This option allows for overriding the default single-threaded thread pool per consumer. However, providing a value for this option is not mandatory; it''s an optional configuration within the "scheduler" groups in Apache Camel when working with the Zendesk component.'
    - question: 'How can I set up the Apache Camel Zendesk component''s scheduler option using either the camel-spring or camel-quartz component, and what values should be used for a built-in scheduler?'
      answer: |
       'To set up the scheduler option for the Apache Camel Zendesk component using either the camel-spring or camel-quartz component, you should specify the value as either "spring" or "quartz". These options provide built-in schedulers within their respective components. If no specific scheduler is required, setting the defaultValue to "none" would be appropriate, but keep in mind that this option is not mandatory (required: false) and only falls under the scheduler group.'
    - question: 'What are the possible uses and default value for the "schedulerProperties" option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component when configuring a custom scheduler or using any of the Quartz or Spring-based schedulers?'
      answer: |
       'The "schedulerProperties" option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component is designed to allow you to configure additional properties when setting up a custom scheduler or utilizing Quartz, Spring-based schedulers. This option is optional, meaning it''s not a required part of the configuration. As for the default value, it is null, which means no default properties are set unless explicitly defined by the user. These properties can be used to fine-tune the behavior and functionality of the scheduler according to specific use cases or requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and whether it''s mandatory to set the option ''startScheduler'' in Apache Camel Zendesk component when using its scheduler, if not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for setting the ''startScheduler'' option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component is true. It''s not mandatory to specify this option if you don''t intend to override the default behavior; the scheduler will be auto-started regardless.'
    - question: 'What is the default time unit for the `initialDelay` and `delay` options when using the Apache Camel Zendesk scheduler component, if no specific time unit has been specified?'
      answer: |
       'The default time unit for the `initialDelay` and `delay` options when using the Apache Camel Zendesk scheduler component is Milliseconds, in case no specific time unit has been explicitly specified.'
    - question: 'How does setting the "useFixedDelay" option to false in the Apache Camel Zendesk component affect the scheduling behavior, compared to its default value (true)? And can you explain the difference between fixed delay and fixed rate in this context?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "useFixedDelay" option to false in the Apache Camel Zendesk component changes the scheduling behavior from using a fixed delay to a fixed rate. This means that tasks will be scheduled at a constant interval regardless of task completion time, unlike when it''s set to true where tasks are delayed for a fixed amount of time between executions but execution frequency may vary due to task duration. The key difference between fixed delay and fixed rate in this context is that fixed delay schedules tasks with a gap based on the last completion time while fixed rate schedules tasks at regular intervals, regardless of their completion times.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, requirement status, and group affiliation of the Apache Camel component Zendesk option named "oauthToken"?'
      answer: |
       'The "oauthToken" option within the Zendesk component in Apache Camel serves as a string that holds your OAuth token for authentication purposes. By default, it does not have a value assigned (defaultValue: null). Its data type is a string, and it''s not required to be provided. This option falls under the security group due to its role in maintaining secure connections with Zendesk.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it is required when using the ''password'' option in the Apache Camel component ''zendesk'', under the ''security'' group? Is there a default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'In the Zendesk component of Apache Camel, the ''password'' option belongs to the ''security'' group. It describes the password used for authentication purposes. The default value for this option is null, meaning no default value is provided. The data type is a string. It''s important to note that using this option is not mandatory; the ''password'' option can be omitted if other suitable authentication methods are employed.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "token" option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component, and is it required? Additionally, can you provide information about the data type and group to which this option belongs?'
      answer: |
       'The "token" option within the Apache Camel Zendesk component serves as a security token for authentication purposes. It''s not set with a default value (defaultValue: null), meaning you should provide your own security token when configuring this option. The data type of this option is a string ("type":"string"). Lastly, it belongs to the "security" group of options due to its role in maintaining the security aspects of the Zendesk integration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it''s required for the ''username'' option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component?'
      answer: |
       'The ''username'' option in the Apache Camel Zendesk component is a string type field with a group associated with security. Its purpose is to provide the user name, although it does not have a default value (defaultValue: null). Whether it''s required for usage is optional as the ''required'' property is set to false.'
