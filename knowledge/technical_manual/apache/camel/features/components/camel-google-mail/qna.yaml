seed_examples:
    - question: 'What is the purpose and possible values for the option "applicationName" in the Apache Camel component "google-mail", and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel "google-mail" component serves to specify the name of the Google Mail application. For instance, a valid value could be "camel-google-mail/1.0". This option is not mandatory as it has been marked as "required: false", meaning that you can choose to provide a value or not when configuring this component in your Camel routes. It belongs to the group of common options within the context of this component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail"? Additionally, is it mandatory for this option to be provided when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail" serves the purpose of providing a unique identifier for the mail application. This ID is used by Google to authenticate your application. However, it does not come with a default value, meaning you will need to provide it yourself during configuration. The use of this option is not mandatory, as the component can still function without it; but if you want to send emails using your own account, you''ll need to supply a valid client ID.'
    - question: 'What is the configuration object structure for the shared configuration when using the Google Mail component in Apache Camel? And do I need to provide this configuration if it''s not required by default?'
      answer: |
       'The configuration object structure for the shared configuration when using the Google Mail component in Apache Camel is an "object" type, as indicated in your information. This object can be optionally provided under the "configuration" key to use the shared configuration. However, it''s important to note that this configuration is not required by default.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component, and is it required when using this component? Also, where might this option be typically used within the context of the Google service?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel Google Mail component, the "delegate" option allows you to delegate for a wide-domain service account. This means that you can use a single service account to impersonate multiple users in a domain. The default value for this option is null, meaning it doesn''t have a preset value and you can provide one as needed. Using the "delegate" option is not mandatory when working with the Google Mail component, but it can be particularly useful within the context of the Google service when you need to access emails on behalf of multiple users in a domain.'
    - question: 'What array of GMail scopes are available as an optional configuration for the Apache Camel Google Mail component?'
      answer: |
       'The array of GMail scopes available as an optional configuration for the Apache Camel Google Mail component includes:              - "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/mail.compose" (send email)       - "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/mail.readonly" (read only email)       - "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts.readonly" (read contacts)       - "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events" (view calendar events)       - "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly" (read-only calendar access)       - "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.modifyEvents" (modify calendar events)'
    - question: 'In the context of the Apache Camel component Google-Mail, what is the purpose and default value of the bridgeErrorHandler option, and under what conditions can it be enabled? Additionally, how does it differ from the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of the Apache Camel Google-Mail component, the "bridgeErrorHandler" option allows for linking the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions (if supported by the third-party component) that occur while the Camel consumer is trying to retrieve incoming messages will now be treated as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler.              By default, the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is set to false. It can only be enabled if the third-party component allows Camel to be notified of an exception being thrown. Some components manage exceptions internally, preventing the use of bridgeErrorHandler. However, in some situations, we may enhance the Camel Google-Mail component to interface with the third-party component to make this feature possible for future releases.              In contrast, by default, the consumer will utilize the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to manage exceptions. These exceptions are logged at WARN or ERROR level and then ignored. This built-in exception handler serves as a fallback when bridgeErrorHandler is not enabled or supported.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Google-Mail component affect the behavior of the producer, and why might it be useful to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Google-Mail component allows the producer to start lazily, which means it will only initialize when the first message is processed. This can be beneficial in scenarios where the producer may initially fail during startup due to various reasons, causing the entire route to fail. By deferring the startup to a lazy mode, you can handle these initial failures using Camel''s routing error handlers without preventing the route from starting up altogether.              However, do take note that since the producer will only start when the first message is processed, there may be a slight increase in total processing time as creating and starting the producer could take some additional time. This trade-off between immediate startup failure versus potential prolonged processing might make this option useful in situations where you prioritize route availability over instant response times.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component, and can it be turned off if needed?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component is responsible for enabling or disabling automatic autowiring. By default, it is set to true, meaning that it allows for the automatic configuration of components like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. However, if needed, it can be manually turned off as it is an optional feature under the "advanced" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientFactory" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail", and can I use a custom factory for creating the client, and if so, how?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientFactory" option in the Apache Camel "google-mail" component is designed to specify a factory for creating the Google Calendar client. By default, it uses the BatchGoogleMailClientFactory. If you''d like to use a custom factory for creating the client, you can set this option accordingly. To do so, you would assign an instance of your desired factory class to the "clientFactory" option when configuring your route. This feature falls under the advanced group of options, indicating it may not be necessary for basic usage but provides more flexibility in certain scenarios.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail", and why is it recommended to use the "refreshToken" instead for long-term usage, considering its default value is null?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessToken" option within the Apache Camel "google-mail" component is an OAuth 2 access token used to authenticate your application with Google Mail services. However, it''s important to note that this token has a typical expiration time of around an hour. Given this, it''s recommended to utilize the "refreshToken" for long-term usage. The refresh token, once obtained, can be used to request a new access token when the initial one expires, thereby ensuring continued access to Google Mail services without frequent reauthorization.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-mail", and is it required for use? (Purpose: Client secret of the mail application, Default Value: null, Required: false)'
      answer: |
       'The "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-mail" serves as the client secret for your mail application. This secret is used to maintain the security and integrity of communication between your application and Google''s servers. However, it is important to note that this option has a default value of null, meaning you will need to provide your own client secret when using this component. Despite the importance of this setting for security reasons, the "clientSecret" option in the "google-mail" component is not required for use.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel Google Mail component to automatically obtain a new OAuth 2 access token when the current one expires, ensuring smooth operation for long-lived applications within the security group?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel Google Mail component to automatically obtain a new OAuth 2 access token when the current one expires, you can make use of the "refreshToken" option. By setting this option in your configuration, the Google Calendar component will be able to get a new accessToken whenever the current one expires - a necessity for long-lived applications within the security group. Here''s an example of how you might set it up:              ```xml       GoogleMailComponent googleMailComponent = new GoogleMailComponent();       googleMailComponent.setRefreshToken("YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN");       context.getEndpoint("google-mail", "direct:myGoogleEndpoint").setComponent(googleMailComponent);       ```              In this example, replace "YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN" with the actual OAuth 2 refresh token you have obtained during the authorization process. This will ensure smooth operation of your long-lived application while maintaining security standards within the security group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and format of the "serviceAccountKey" option within the Apache Camel component "google-mail", and how can it be provided if the application is to authenticate as a service account?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceAccountKey" option within the Apache Camel component "google-mail" serves the purpose of authenticating an application as a Google Service Account. It requires a JSON format string that represents your service account key, which can be provided in base64 encoding by prefixing it with "base64:". However, this parameter is optional and not necessarily required for authentication. When using base64 encoding, ensure to include the prefix for proper decoding within the application. This option falls under the security group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of and potential values for the "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel''s Google Mail component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "applicationName" option in Apache Camel''s Google Mail component is an optional string parameter that specifies the name of the Google mail application. This value typically follows a camel-case format, such as "camel-google-mail/1.0". However, it can be any valid string as long as it adheres to the camelCase naming convention for Apache Camel components. Its purpose is to help identify and manage different Google Mail applications within your Camel integration project. If not provided, it will default to null.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail" serves as the Client ID of your Google Mail application. This value helps to authenticate your application with the Google service. By default, the "defaultValue" for the "clientId" option is null, meaning you need to provide a specific Client ID when using this component if you wish to interact with Google Mail. However, whether it''s required or not depends on your use case and setup; it can be omitted as long as you have provided a valid service account key in the appropriate configuration group ("groups":"common").'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel''s Google Mail component, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "delegate" option in Apache Camel''s Google Mail component is designed for use with wide-domain service accounts. This option allows you to delegate permissions to another user for a specific scope or set of scopes. The default value for this option is null, meaning that it does not have a predefined value. Using the "delegate" option is optional when working with this component; it''s not required for every use case.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel component "google-mail" option called "inBody", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "google-mail" component''s option named "inBody" serves the purpose of passing a parameter within the exchange In Body during its usage. By default, no value is assigned to this option, as indicated by its defaultValue: null. Whether or not you need to specify this option when using the "google-mail" component is optional, as it has been designated as required: false in your provided information.'
    - question: 'What are the available GMail scopes that can be specified when using the ''scopes'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-mail''? Is the specification of these scopes optional and if so, does the component have a default value for these scopes?'
      answer: |
       'In response to your question, when using the ''scopes'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-mail'', you can specify various GMail scopes. These scopes define the level of access that an application has over Google Mail resources. For example, "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/mail.send", "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts.readonly", and "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar" are some of the available GMail scopes. The specification of these scopes is optional, as indicated by the ''required'' field being set to false in your provided information. However, it''s important to note that if no scopes are specified, the component does not have a default value for these scopes. You will need to explicitly specify the required scopes based on your application''s needs.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel Google-Mail component, and can it be considered a required setting?'
      answer: |
       'The "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel Google-Mail component is designed to allow you to send an empty message (no body) if the polling consumer did not find any files to process. This can be useful in scenarios where you want the consumer to signal that it''s idle, even when no actual data is available. The default value for this option is false, meaning that it does not automatically send an empty message when idling. It is considered as an optional setting as it can be safely left unchanged if you don''t require such behavior.'
    - question: 'How does the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel''s google-mail component function, and under what circumstances would it be beneficial to set it to true instead of relying on the default ExceptionHandler?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel''s google-mail component allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages will be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.              Setting "bridgeErrorHandler" to true can be beneficial when the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. This enables more customized error handling, as the errors are no longer simply logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. Instead, they are handled according to the rules defined in the routing Error Handler, which could include retrying, logging, or sending notifications.              However, it''s important to note that not all components support this functionality; some handle exceptions internally only. In such cases, "bridgeErrorHandler" is not possible. Future improvements to the Camel component may make it possible to hook into the 3rd party component and enable this feature for more components.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel `exceptionHandler` option in the `google-mail` component, and what happens when this option is not specified? Also, how does the `exceptionHandler` option interact with the `bridgeErrorHandler` option, and can a custom ExceptionHandler be used if the `bridgeErrorHandler` is enabled?'
      answer: |
       'The `exceptionHandler` option in the Apache Camel `google-mail` component allows users to implement a custom ExceptionHandler. By default, exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level will be handled by the consumer, with the system ignoring them. When the `exceptionHandler` option is not specified, the behavior follows this default setting.              The interaction between the `exceptionHandler` and `bridgeErrorHandler` options is as follows: if the `bridgeErrorHandler` is enabled, the `exceptionHandler` will not be in use. This means that if `bridgeErrorHandler` is activated, a custom ExceptionHandler cannot be used.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "exchangePattern" option within the Apache Camel''s "google-mail" component, and why is it considered an advanced group under the consumer settings?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "exchangePattern" option within the Apache Camel''s "google-mail" component is null. This option determines the exchange pattern when a consumer creates an exchange, which influences how messages are processed. Since understanding and setting this option requires a deeper understanding of message routing and processing, it is considered part of the advanced group under consumer settings in Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel Google-Mail component, and what is its purpose when providing a custom implementation?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel Google-Mail component is null, meaning no default poll strategy is set. However, you can provide your custom implementation to this option as it''s a pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy. This allows you to control error handling that typically occurs during the poll operation before an Exchange has been created and routed in Camel. This feature is particularly useful when you need to customize the behavior of the component according to your specific use case requirements, grouped under "consumer (advanced)".'
    - question: 'Here''s a possible question based on the provided information:              "What is the purpose of the ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component, and what are the potential benefits and drawbacks associated with enabling it?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component allows for a producer to be started lazily (on the first message), rather than during route startup. This can be beneficial in scenarios where the producer may otherwise fail during start-up, causing the entire route to fail as well. By deferring the production startup to the lazy mode, any potential failure can be handled through Camel''s routing error handlers when messages are being processed.              However, it is important to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some additional time, prolonging the overall processing time of the route. This can impact the performance of your application if many messages need to be processed quickly. Therefore, consider enabling this option judiciously, especially in situations where the potential benefits outweigh the potential drawbacks on the system''s processing efficiency.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component, and under what circumstances (if any) does it require a value? Also, where does this option belong in terms of its usage with other options within the component''s configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component is an integer value that indicates the number of subsequent error polls (failed due to some error) that should occur before the backoffMultiplier should kick-in. This means it controls how many times a failed operation is retried before increasing the delay between retries. The default value for this option is null, meaning no specific threshold is set if not provided.              This option is not required, and its usage can be skipped if you don''t wish to customize the error backoff behavior. However, setting a non-default value may help fine-tune the retry mechanism based on your application''s needs or error handling strategy.              In terms of its usage within the component''s configuration, the "backoffErrorThreshold" option belongs to the "scheduler" group and can be found among other scheduler-related options when configuring the Google Mail component in your Apache Camel setup.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel component google-mail option named "backoffIdleThreshold" in relation to its group "scheduler", if there is no default value provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffIdleThreshold" option for the Apache Camel Google Mail component, under the "scheduler" group, determines the number of consecutive idle polls that should occur before the "backoffMultiplier" mechanism becomes active. However, it''s important to note that this option does not have a default value as specified in your data. This means that when using this component, you may need to explicitly set this parameter according to your application''s needs if you wish to customize the idle poll backoff behavior.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel component "google-mail" option named "backoffMultiplier" when it comes to scheduled polling consumers, and how does its default value and usage interact with the options "backoffIdleThreshold" and "backoffErrorThreshold"?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffMultiplier" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component is used to manage backoffs in scheduled polling consumers, specifically when there have been a series of idle or error events. Setting a non-null value for "backoffMultiplier" indicates that the consumer should skip a specified number of polls after multiple consecutive idles or errors before attempting again. This helps prevent overwhelming Google Mail''s server with too many requests in quick succession, especially when dealing with temporary issues like network latency.              In such scenarios, it is essential to configure both "backoffIdleThreshold" and/or "backoffErrorThreshold" alongside "backoffMultiplier". These options define the number of idle or error events that trigger a backoff in the first place. For example, if "backoffIdleThreshold" is set to 3, the consumer will begin skipping polls after three consecutive idle events, using the configured "backoffMultiplier" for calculation. Similarly, if "backoffErrorThreshold" is set and an error occurs, the consumer will also back off based on the specified threshold and "backoffMultiplier".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delay" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail" under the "scheduler" group, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option when configuring this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "delay" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail", under the "scheduler" group, serves as a millisecond timer before the next poll. It has a default value of 500 (meaning polling occurs every half a second if no custom delay is specified). Providing a value for this option is optional; you''re not required to set it when configuring the component.'
    - question: 'What is the behavior of the Apache Camel component "google-mail" option named "greedy" when enabled in a scheduler context and how does it affect the operation of the ScheduledPollConsumer?'
      answer: |
       'When you enable the "greedy" option for the "google-mail" component within a scheduler context, the behavior of the ScheduledPollConsumer changes. Specifically, if greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will execute once more immediately following a run that polled one or more messages. This means that it will continue to check for new emails at shorter intervals than what was originally scheduled, as long as there are messages waiting to be processed. However, please note that this option has a default value of false, and its usage is optional within the scheduler groups.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the initialDelay option in the Apache Camel google-mail component, and is it a required configuration parameter? (Hint: The default value is an integer and its unit is milliseconds. It is not a required parameter.)'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel "google-mail" component is an integer of 1000 milliseconds (or 1 second). This option specifies the delay before the first poll starts, and it''s not a required configuration parameter. It falls under the "scheduler" group.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum number of times an Apache Camel route using the google-mail component will fire if the repeatCount option is set to 5?'
      answer: |
       'The maximum number of times an Apache Camel route using the google-mail component will fire, when the repeatCount option is set to 5, is five times. This means that after the fifth firing of the schedule, the route will not execute again unless the repeatCount option is reset or removed and a new schedule is triggered.'
    - question: 'What is the default logging level for the "start/complete" log lines generated by the Google Mail component in Apache Camel when the "runLoggingLevel" option is not specified, and which logging levels are supported for configuration purposes?'
      answer: |
       'The default logging level for the "start/complete" log lines generated by the Google Mail component in Apache Camel is TRACE, when the "runLoggingLevel" option is not specified. Supported logging levels for configuration purposes include: TRACE (most detailed), DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL (least informative).'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom or shared thread pool using the scheduledExecutorService option in the Apache Camel Google-Mail component, and is it required for each consumer to have its own configuration?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom or shared thread pool for the Apache Camel Google-Mail component using the scheduledExecutorService option, you can set this object within your route configuration. By default, each consumer has an individual single-threaded thread pool, but by providing a custom/shared thread pool configuration with this option, you can alter that behavior. This configuration is optional, meaning it''s not required for each consumer to have its own unique configuration if you wish to use the same thread pool across multiple consumers.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Google Mail component in Apache Camel to use a cron scheduler, and what are the available options (built-in schedulers) for this purpose?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Google Mail component in Apache Camel to use a cron scheduler, you can leverage either the camel-spring or camel-quartz components. Both provide built-in cron schedulers. To set up the scheduler, you should specify the value "spring" or "quartz" accordingly while setting up your component configuration. Keep in mind that using a cron scheduler is an optional feature, and if no scheduler is specified, it will not be used by default.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "schedulerProperties" option in the Apache Camel''s Google Mail component when configuring a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz, Spring-based schedulers? Additionally, can you explain the requirement for this option and what type of data it accepts?'
      answer: |
       'The "schedulerProperties" option in Apache Camel''s Google Mail component is designed to allow for the configuration of additional properties when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz, Spring-based schedulers. This option is particularly useful when you wish to customize the behavior of the scheduler beyond the default settings. The "schedulerProperties" accepts an object type of data, which means it can hold multiple key-value pairs for various configurations. However, it''s important to note that this option is optional, as not all use cases may require such customization. The requirement for this option arises when you need to fine-tune the scheduling behavior to suit your specific application needs.'
    - question: '"In the Apache Camel component ''google-mail'', what is the default value for the option ''startScheduler'' and is it mandatory to set this option when using this component?"'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component ''google-mail'', the default value for the option ''startScheduler'' is true, meaning that the scheduler will automatically start upon using this component. However, setting this option is not mandatory, as it can be false if you wish to manually control when the scheduler should start.'
    - question: 'What is the default data type (i.e., milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, etc.) for the timeUnit option in the Apache Camel component ''google-mail'' when using options like initialDelay and delay under the scheduler group, if it is not explicitly specified?'
      answer: |
       'The default data type for the timeUnit option in the Apache Camel component ''google-mail'', when using options like initialDelay and delay under the scheduler group, if not explicitly specified, is milliseconds (MILLISECONDS).'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail", and can it be configured as optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'The "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail" has a default value of true, meaning that a fixed delay is utilized by default. Its purpose is to control whether a fixed delay or fixed rate is applied, with further details available in the JDK''s ScheduledExecutorService. It can be configured as optional, as indicated by the "required": false in its properties.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and recommended use of the ''accessToken'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-mail'', and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The ''accessToken'' option within the Apache Camel component ''google-mail'' is an OAuth 2 access token. This token grants temporary authorization to your application to use Google Mail services. However, due to its expiration after approximately one hour, it''s recommended to use ''refreshToken'' for long-term usage. While you can provide a value for this option, it''s not mandatory in the sense that if you don''t provide one, your application will still be able to interact with Google Mail services, but with fewer permissions and shorter validity period. The ''accessToken'' falls under the security group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and data type (if any) of the optional "clientSecret" configuration option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail"?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientSecret" configuration option within the Apache Camel component "google-mail" serves as a security measure, specifically for storing the client secret of the associated mail application. It is an optional string type parameter that you can provide in case you want to secure your OAuth2 access using a client secret. This option falls under the "security" group, emphasizing its role in safeguarding your application''s communication with Google Mail services.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel component "google-mail" to automatically obtain a new OAuth 2 access token when the current one expires, if I am using a long-lived application?'
      answer: |
       'To automate the process of obtaining a new OAuth 2 access token when the current one expires for the Apache Camel component "google-mail" in your long-lived application, you can configure the refreshToken option. Set the refreshToken to the value of the refresh token obtained during the initial authorization process. By default, this option is not required but can be provided as a string within the security group of settings in your Camel configuration. This will enable the component to obtain a new access token whenever the current one expires.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and format of the "serviceAccountKey" option within the Apache Camel''s "google-mail" component, and how can we provide it when using this option? Also, is it mandatory to use this option for authentication?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceAccountKey" option within Apache Camel''s "google-mail" component is used to authenticate an application as a service account. It requires the service account key in JSON format, which can be provided in Base64 encoding by prefixing it with "base64:". For instance, if your base64 encoded key is "dGVzdA==", you would provide it as "base64:dGVzdA==". However, using this option for authentication is not mandatory; its usage is optional, falling under the security group of component settings.'
