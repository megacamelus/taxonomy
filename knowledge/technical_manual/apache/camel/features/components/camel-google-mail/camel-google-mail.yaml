    - question: 'What is the purpose and possible values of the "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail", and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component serves to specify the name of the application used within the Google Mail context, such as "camel-google-mail/1.0". This value is optional, meaning it''s not required when setting up your configuration for the Google Mail component. If this option is left unset, no default application name will be assigned. The group to which it belongs is "common", indicating that it can be set in common scenarios where the Google Mail component is used.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the "ClientId" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component, and is its usage mandatory or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "Client ID" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component is an identifier unique to your Google Mail application, used for authentication purposes. By default, it does not have a value as it needs to be set by the user. Its usage is optional, but providing one allows integration with Google Mail services. It belongs to the common group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the process for configuring the Google Mail component in Apache Camel using a shared configuration object, if the default configuration value is not set?'
      answer: |
       'To utilize the shared configuration for the Google Mail component in Apache Camel, follow these steps when the default configuration value is not set:              1. Create or locate your desired shared configuration object, ensuring it conforms to the expected structure as specified by the "google-mail" component''s configuration options.       2. Set the relevant configuration properties within this shared configuration object, such as the Google Mail API key and other required parameters.       3. In your Camel route, reference your shared configuration object for the "google-mail" component. This can be accomplished by using a PropertyPlaceholderComponent or another method provided by Apache Camel to access and inject the shared configuration into the Camel route.       4. Use the configured "google-mail" component in your Camel route as usual, taking advantage of the shared configuration to execute Google Mail-related tasks based on its settings.'
    - question: 'How can I set the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail", which is used for a wide-domain service account, when this option''s default value is null? If it''s not necessary to provide a value, how do I handle it when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'To set the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component for a wide-domain service account where its default value is null, you can simply omit providing any value if no delegate is intended. If needed, you can configure the delegate by setting it as a string property under your route configuration, ensuring that the group specified in the properties file (common) also includes this property. For example:              ```       google-mail: {         delegate = "your_delegate_value"       }       ```              In this case, since you want to omit setting the delegate, you won''t include that line when configuring your route.'
    - question: 'What are the supported GMail scopes in the Apache Camel google-mail component and is it mandatory to set a default value for these scopes when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel `google-mail` component, the supported GMail scopes are defined within the "scopes" option. This allows you to access various functionalities of the GMail API as per your needs. However, it is not mandatory to set a default value for these scopes when using this component. You can specify them as an array if required, but leaving it null will still allow basic functionality. These scopes are grouped under "common".'
    - question: 'Can you explain the purpose of the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel Google-Mail component and under what conditions it might be useful to enable this feature?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel Google-Mail component enables bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which means that any exceptions that may occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. This feature is useful when the third-party component (in this case, Google Mail) allows Camel to be informed if an exception was thrown. If the 3rd party component manages exceptions internally, then bridgeErrorHandler is not possible. When this feature is disabled by default, the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, and those will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail" affect the startup behavior and overall performance of a Camel route, and why might it be beneficial to set it to true under certain circumstances?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail" affects the startup behavior and overall performance by deferring the startup of the producer until the first message is processed. This can be beneficial when the production of messages might initially fail, preventing a route from starting up altogether.              In situations where the producer may otherwise cause a route failure during starting, using this lazy start mechanism allows you to handle these startup failures through Camel''s routing error handlers. By allowing for deferred initialization, your application can avoid unnecessary errors and ensure a smoother startup process overall. However, it is essential to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some extra time, potentially increasing the total processing time of the processing.              In summary, enabling "lazyStartProducer" allows for more robust startup behavior, as it helps handle initial failures and ensures that a route can still start up in cases where the production of messages may initially encounter issues. At the cost of a slight performance impact when first message is processed due to the extra time required to create and initialize the producer.'
    - question: 'In relation to the Apache Camel component "google-mail", can you explain what is meant by the option "autowiredEnabled" and when it might be useful to disable or keep it enabled? Furthermore, how can I determine if autowiring is enabled for this specific component and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel "google-mail" component refers to whether automatic wiring (autowiring) is enabled or not. This feature helps Camel automatically configure instances of matching types by looking up in the registry. When you enable autowiring, it can be useful for configuring components like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc., saving you the effort of manual configuration. However, you might want to disable this option when you need fine-grained control over the configuration of specific components or if there are unique needs that autowiring does not address. To check if autowiring is enabled for the "google-mail" component, examine its settings as the default value is set to true. If it''s been explicitly disabled in your configuration, you can confirm this by observing changes in component behavior when setting it to false.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "clientFactory" option in the Apache Camel Google-mail component, and what default value does it have when not provided? Also, is there an option to use a specific factory for creating the client, such as GoogleCalendarClientFactory, instead of the default BatchGoogleMailClientFactory?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel Google-mail component, the "clientFactory" option serves the purpose of setting up a factory for creating the client. By default, when not provided, it uses the `BatchGoogleMailClientFactory`. However, you can specify a different factory such as `GoogleCalendarClientFactory` if needed, to customize the type of Google client instance that gets created. This functionality falls under advanced settings in Camel.'
    - question: 'What should be considered when using the ''accessToken'' option of the Apache Camel Google Mail component, and why is it recommended to use the ''refreshToken'' instead for long-term usage?'
      answer: |
       'When utilizing the ''accessToken'' option of the Apache Camel Google Mail component, it''s essential to understand that this token has an expiration time of approximately one hour. Since your applications may require prolonged access, it is recommended to use the ''refreshToken'' instead for long-term usage. The reason behind this suggestion lies in the refresh token''s property: it allows automatic renewal of the access token without the need for a user intervention, ensuring continuous, uninterrupted access to Google Mail services in your applications.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component, and is its use mandatory or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component is a string used for storing the client secret of the mail application, which is a crucial piece of your authentication data when setting up integrations with Google''s APIs. The default value for this option is null. The use of "clientSecret" is optional but is strongly recommended to ensure secure access to Google services as it pairs with your API key or OAuth 2.0 credentials under the category of security group settings in Camel configuration.'
    - question: 'How does setting a refreshToken for the Apache Camel google-mail component improve its ability to handle access token expiration in a long-lived application?'
      answer: |
       'Setting a refresh token for the Apache Camel Google Mail component enhances its capability to manage access token expiration in a long-lived application by enabling it to acquire a new access token once the current one expires. The OAuth 2 refresh token provides this functionality, ensuring that your application continues uninterrupted access to Google Calendar services even as access tokens are renewed over time. This feature is categorized under the security group in our component configuration options.'
    - question: 'How do I properly set up the "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel google-mail component if I want to authenticate my application as a service account and have the key provided in base64 format? Does the value require any specific prefix or additional steps for successful authentication?'
      answer: |
       'To properly set up the "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component when you want to authenticate your application as a service account with the key provided in base64 format, simply prepend your base64-encoded string with the prefix "base64:" before inserting it into the configuration. Here''s an example:              ```java       googleMailComponent().setServiceAccountKey(Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString("YOUR_SECRET_KEY".getBytes()))           .setServiceAccountId("<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>")           // ...other configuration options       ```              Ensure that you have properly configured the rest of your components, such as setting a Service Account Email or OAuth2 Client Id/Client Secret if needed for your use case. Pay attention to the security group when configuring this option as it may impact the overall security of your application.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail"?'
      answer: |
       'The "applicationName" option within the Apache Camel Google-Mail component is intended to specify the name of the Google Mail application, should it be explicitly provided. By default, this option does not have a set value (defaultValue: null). You can provide the application name in camelCase format, for instance, camel-google-mail/1.0, if desired, but its usage is optional as implied by the "required": false attribute. This component belongs to the common groups of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value, if any, for the "clientId" option in the Apache Camel''s "google-mail" component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option in Apache Camel''s "google-mail" component is an optional string type that represents the Client ID of the mail application when using Google Mail as a component. Its default value is null, meaning you need to provide it manually if you have one.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail", if it is configured, and whether its usage is required?'
      answer: |
       'The "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail" serves a purpose when using service accounts for wide-domain applications. This option allows you to delegate the use of an impersonated account to perform actions on behalf of the service account. However, it''s important to note that providing a default value for this option is not mandatory; its usage is optional within the "common" configuration group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''inBody'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-mail'', and is it mandatory or optional to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The ''inBody'' option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component is an optional string parameter that allows you to set the name of a parameter to be passed in the email body during exchange. By default, there is no default value for this option.'
    - question: 'What are the available Google Mail (Apache Camel `google-mail`) component options for setting GMail scopes, and does it have a default value? Also, is specifying these scopes optional or required in the configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The Google Mail (`google-mail`) Apache Camel component provides an option called "scopes" under the group "common". This option is used to specify GMail scopes, which define the level of access you request when your application interacts with a user''s GMail data. The default value for this option is not set (`defaultValue: null`), meaning you may need to explicitly provide it in your configuration. Specifying these scopes is optional, but it is recommended to do so to ensure your application only accesses the necessary GMail data as per user consent requirements.'
    - question: '"What does the ''sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle'' option do in the Apache Camel google-mail component, and what is its default value and possible data types?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle'' option in the Apache Camel Google-Mail component allows you to control if an empty message (no body) should be sent when there are no files polled by the consumer. Its default value is false, meaning that it''s disabled by default. This option accepts boolean data types. It falls under the ''consumer'' group of settings.'
    - question: 'How does the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel''s google-mail component affect error handling when compared to the default error handling mechanism, and under what circumstances can it be configured to use it?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel''s Google Mail component enables bridging the consumer to Camel''s routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages will be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler, instead of being logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored, which is the default behavior.              However, it''s important to note that this functionality is only possible if the third-party component (in this case, Google Mail) allows Camel to be alerted when an exception has been thrown. If the component handles exceptions internally and does not allow external notification of them, then using the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is not possible.              In some situations, future releases may improve the Camel component to integrate more seamlessly with third-party components, making it possible to use the bridgeErrorHandler for better error handling.'
    - question: '"What is the purpose of the ''exceptionHandler'' option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component, and when is it not used by default? Also, what happens to exceptions when this option is not utilized, and how can a custom ExceptionHandler be implemented?"'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel Google Mail component, the ''exceptionHandler'' option allows you to use a custom ExceptionHandler to manage errors that occur during communication with Google Mail. However, by default, the component handles exceptions at log levels of WARN or ERROR, ignoring them in the process. It is worth noting that if the ''bridgeErrorHandler'' option is enabled, the ''exceptionHandler'' is not used.              When the ''exceptionHandler'' option is not utilized, any unhandled exceptions during communication with Google Mail will also be handled in accordance with the default settings. They will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and then ignored.              To implement a custom ExceptionHandler, you can provide an object that conforms to the necessary specifications within the ''consumer (advanced)'' group when configuring your Camel route with the Google Mail component. This enables you to create a tailored approach for dealing with exceptions throughout the communication process.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component when setting up a consumer, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component is designed to set the exchange pattern when a consumer creates an exchange. It''s optional, meaning you don''t necessarily need to provide a value for it. However, if you do choose to use it, its default value is not defined. This option falls under the advanced group of settings related to consumers in Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `pollStrategy` option within the Apache Camel Google Mail component, and can it be provided with a custom implementation if so, how can this be done?'
      answer: |
       'The `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component allows you to customize the error handling that may occur during the poll operation before an Exchange is created and routed. You can provide your own implementation of the `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy` interface to control how errors are handled. To do this, create your own class implementing the `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy` interface and use it in your route configuration. If you want to use a custom `pollStrategy`, simply set it as an option when defining the Google Mail component in your Camel route. For instance:              ```java       from("google-mail:inbox?username=user@example.com&password=myPassword&pollStrategy=MyCustomPollingStrategy")           .to("direct:myProcessor");       ```'
    - question: 'How does setting the "lazyStartProducer" option to true in an Apache Camel route that uses the Google Mail component impact the startup behavior and overall processing time when handling emails?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "lazyStartProducer" option to true in an Apache Camel route utilizing the Google Mail component allows for a more flexible startup behavior, particularly in scenarios where the producer (in this case, the email connection) may initially fail during the context and route initialization. By starting the producer lazily, it permits the route to bypass this failure and continue the startup process.              However, it is crucial to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer (email connection) can take a slight amount of time compared to initiating the producers during the route start-up. This could prolong the total processing time of email handling, as some of the time will be spent on-demand, i.e., when processing messages.              Additionally, using this option allows Camel''s routing error handlers to manage any startup failures associated with the producer (email connection). This can help handle potential errors and ensure that your route can continue operating without interruptions due to initial configuration issues or errors. Keep in mind that the "lazyStartProducer" is considered an advanced option grouped as "producer (advanced)".'
    - question: '"What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel component ''google-mail'' option named ''backoffErrorThreshold'', and under which group this configuration setting can be found in the scheduler?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''backoffErrorThreshold'' option for the Apache Camel component ''google-mail'' determines the number of subsequent error polls (when an error occurs) that should happen before the ''backoffMultipler'' kicks in to manage retry attempts due to errors. By default, this setting does not have a value assigned (defaultValue: null). This configuration setting is found under the ''scheduler'' group within the Camel component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the Apache Camel component "google-mail" option called "backoffIdleThreshold", and when is it considered to be required in a configuration group? (Hint: This option specifies the number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in, and it''s optional.)'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffIdleThreshold" option for the Apache Camel component "google-mail" is an optional configuration setting that defines the number of consecutive idle polls that should occur before the "backoffMultipler" mechanism becomes active. This value serves as a timer to initiate backoff when there''s no activity detected. By default, this option doesn''t have a set value (defaultValue: null). The group where it falls under is the "scheduler." It''s important to note that this option is not considered mandatory in your configuration; it only triggers when there are periods of idleness during the polling process.'
    - question: '"In the context of Apache Camel''s google-mail component, what purpose does the ''backoffMultiplier'' option serve when it is used in a scheduled polling consumer setup?"'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s google-mail component, the ''backoffMultiplier'' option serves to allow a scheduled polling consumer to temporarily pause or back off if there have been multiple consecutive idle periods or errors. Specifically, it indicates the number of polls that will be skipped before the next attempt is made. This option is particularly useful when dealing with transient issues that might cause multiple idles or errors in quick succession, allowing the consumer to "recoil" and then resume more stable operation once the issue has passed. However, it''s important to note that when ''backoffMultiplier'' is used, both backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold should also be configured.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it''s required to use the ''delay'' option in the Apache Camel ''google-mail'' component when configuring email scheduling using milliseconds?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel ''google-mail'' component, the ''delay'' option is used to specify milliseconds before the next poll for email scheduling purposes. Its default value is 500 (half a second), which can be altered according to your desired timing. The data type of this option is an integer, and it is not necessary to use it, as indicated by the ''required'' field being set to false. This option falls under the ''scheduler'' groups within the configuration settings.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component affect the behavior of the ScheduledPollConsumer when polling emails? Specifically, when is the ScheduledPollConsumer likely to run again if the "greedy" option is enabled compared to when it is not enabled?'
      answer: |
       'When the "greedy" option is enabled in the Apache Camel Google Mail component, the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again if the previous run polled one or more messages. However, when this option is not enabled, the ScheduledPollConsumer would typically wait according to its schedule before running again, regardless of whether any messages were retrieved in the previous run.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel "google-mail" component, and is it necessary for this option to be set? (Hint: It has a description as ''Milliseconds before the first poll starts'', and its default value is given as 1000. The type of this option is an integer.)'
      answer: |
       'The "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel "google-mail" component is an integer data type with a default value of 1000, which means it is set to 1000 milliseconds. This option determines the delay before the first poll starts. It is not a necessary requirement for this option to be set, as the default value is provided and can be overridden if desired, grouped under the scheduler settings in the component''s configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and possible values for the repeatCount option in the Apache Camel google-mail component when using a scheduler, and what does each possible value indicate regarding the number of times an event will be sent via this component?'
      answer: |
       'The repeatCount option in the Apache Camel google-mail component, when used with a scheduler, has a default value of 0. A value of zero or negative means the event will be sent perpetually (fire forever). However, if you set a positive integer value for repeatCount, it specifies a maximum limit on the number of times the event will be sent via this component. For example, setting it to 1 indicates that the scheduler will only fire once, while setting it to 5 means it will fire five times.'
    - question: 'What is the default logging level for starting and completing a Google-Mail Consumer poll in an Apache Camel route, and how can I configure this level if needed?'
      answer: |
       'The default logging level for starting and completing a Google-Mail Consumer poll in an Apache Camel route is TRACE. If you wish to configure this logging level, you can do so using the "runLoggingLevel" option in your configuration. This option allows you to adjust the logging level according to your needs.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "scheduledExecutorService" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail", and is it optional to configure this setting?'
      answer: |
       'The "scheduledExecutorService" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail component is designed to allow for customization or sharing of a thread pool for the consumer. By default, each consumer has its own single-threaded thread pool. Configuring this option allows you to adjust that by using a specified thread pool for multiple consumers. The default value for this option is null, meaning it''s not set by default, and it can be configured optionally within the "scheduler" group of settings.'
    - question: 'How should you configure the Google Mail component''s "scheduler" option in Apache Camel to use a cron scheduler, and are there any default values for this configuration?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Google Mail component''s "scheduler" option in Apache Camel to use a cron scheduler, you can specify either "spring" or "quartz" as the value for this option. Both spring-cron and quartz-cron schedulers are supported within the camel-spring and camel-quartz components respectively. However, it''s important to note that there is no default value for this configuration, so you must provide a valid cron expression if you choose to use the scheduler option.'
    - question: 'What are the available options for configuring additional properties when using a custom scheduler with the Apache Camel component "google-mail"? Can you provide an example of how to set these properties, assuming that the default value is not provided?'
      answer: |
       'To configure additional properties when utilizing a custom scheduler, such as your specific use of Google Mail (Apache Camel component), you can make use of the "schedulerProperties" option. This allows for customization beyond the standard Quartz or Spring-based schedulers.              Here''s an example of setting these properties:              ```yaml       from("google-mail://sendMail?property1=value1&property2=value2")           .schedulerProperties(header("X-My-Custom-Header"))       ```              In the above example, "property1" and "property2" are custom properties that you want to set. The value for these properties is determined by the `header("X-My-Custom-Header")` line, which should be replaced with an appropriate expression or route expression depending on your use case. If you don''t wish to set a specific value, you can omit them from your configuration altogether as their default value is null.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and whether it''s required to manually start the scheduler in Apache Camel Google Mail component when using the ''startScheduler'' option?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for starting the scheduler in Apache Camel Google Mail component, when using the ''startScheduler'' option, is true. This means that the scheduler will automatically start upon initialization. However, it''s not a required setting; if you want to manually control the start of the scheduler, you can choose to provide a false value for this option.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the Apache Camel component ''google-mail'' option called ''timeUnit'', which is used to set a time unit for initialDelay and delay options in the context of scheduling operations, and whether it is required? (Answer: MILLISECONDS, Object, optional)'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel component ''google-mail'' option called ''timeUnit'' is MILLISECONDS. It is of type Object and is optional within the scheduler groups.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel Google Mail component''s useFixedDelay option to use a fixed rate instead of a fixed delay, if provided, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel Google Mail component''s "useFixedDelay" option to use a fixed rate instead of a fixed delay, set this option to false when configuring your route. This will use ScheduledExecutorService''s fixed rate execution instead. The default value for this option is true, meaning it initially uses a fixed delay. You can find more details about fixed rate and fixed delay in the Java Documentation for ScheduledExecutorService within JDK.'
    - question: 'How can I set an OAuth 2 access token in Apache Camel''s google-mail component for short-term usage, given that this option is not required and the default value is null?'
      answer: |
       'To use an OAuth 2 access token for short-term purposes in Apache Camel''s `google-mail` component without requiring a refresh token, you can manually set it by providing a string value for the "accessToken" property within your Camel context configuration. Since the default value is null and the option is not required, you would need to explicitly assign the token as follows:              ```       google-mail Component         .property("accessToken", "<your_OAuth2_token_here>")         // other Camel configuration...       ```'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, and whether it''s required to set the ''clientSecret'' option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail", under the category of security?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component "google-mail", the ''clientSecret'' option is designed for securing your mail application by providing a secret key. By default, it has no predefined value (''defaultValue'': null), which means you need to provide one during configuration. However, setting it is not required (''required'': false) as it depends on your specific use case and security preferences, falling under the ''security'' category.'
    - question: 'How should I properly set the `refreshToken` option in an Apache Camel route that utilizes the Google Mail component to ensure that the application can automatically obtain a new access token when the current one expires, if this refresh token configuration is not required by default?'
      answer: |
       'To automate the process of obtaining a new access token for the Google Calendar component within your Apache Camel route when the current one expires (which is essential for long-lived applications), you can set the `refreshToken` option if it''s not already configured by default. Although this option is not required by default, you may include it in the configuration.              Here''s an example of how to do that: Assuming your route already includes Google Mail component and is named "googleMail", you can set the `refreshToken` property as follows:              ```xml       from("direct:start")           .to("google-mail://your_gmail_url?user=${{user}}&password=${{password}}&oauth2RefreshToken=${{refresh_token}}&clientId=${{clientId}}&clientSecret=${{clientSecret}}")       // ... rest of the route here       ```              Just replace `${{refresh_token}}` with the appropriate refresh token and ensure that it conforms to the "type":"string" data type. This configuration ensures your application can automatically fetch a new access token upon expiration without any manual intervention.'
    - question: 'How can I set up and use the "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel "google-mail" component to authenticate my application as a service account, and what is the correct format for providing this key if it''s in base64?'
      answer: |
       'To set up and use the "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel "google-mail" component to authenticate your application as a service account, you should provide a JSON formatted service account key. If your service account key is in base64 format, prefix it with ''base64:'' before providing it within double quotes. Here''s an example:              ```json       {         "google-mail": {           "serviceAccountKey": "base64:YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_KEY"         }       }       ```'
