    - question: 'Given the description of the `bridgeErrorHandler` option for the Apache Camel component `hwcloud-obs`, here''s a question that can be answered using the provided information:              "What is the purpose and default value of the ''bridgeErrorHandler'' option in the Apache Camel component ''hwcloud-obs'', and under what conditions can it be utilized?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''bridgeErrorHandler'' option in the Apache Camel component ''hwcloud-obs'' serves to bridge the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions (if possible) encountered while the Camel consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. However, its utilization is contingent on whether the third-party component allows Camel to be notified if an exception was thrown; some components handle exceptions internally only, precluding the use of bridgeErrorHandler. By default, the consumer will utilize the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, which are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. The default value of ''bridgeErrorHandler'' is false.'
    - question: 'Given the provided information about the Apache Camel component "hwcloud-obs" option named "lazyStartProducer", here''s a question that can be answered using it:              How does configuring the "lazyStartProducer" option in an Huawei Cloud OBS (Object Storage Service) Camel producer affect its startup behavior, and what potential impact could it have on processing time?'
      answer: |
       'Configuring the "lazyStartProducer" option in an Apache Camel Huawei Cloud OBS producer allows for delayed start of the producer. This can be useful when a producer might otherwise fail during the startup, causing the route to fail as well. By deferring the producer''s startup until the first message is processed, any failure during starting can be handled through Camel''s routing error handlers.              However, be aware that when the first message is processed and the producer is created and started, it may take additional time, thus potentially prolonging the total processing time of the processing. This trade-off between immediate startup failure prevention and slightly longer processing time should be carefully considered based on the specific use case requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel component ''hwcloud-obs'', and can this feature be disabled if necessary?'
      answer: |
       'The ''autowiredEnabled'' option within the Apache Camel component ''hwcloud-obs'' is set to a default value of true, which enables automatic autowiring. This feature allows for the automatic configuration of components such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, and more by looking up in the registry to find a single instance of matching type. If you wish to disable this feature, it can be done by setting ''autowiredEnabled'' to false under ''advanced'' settings when configuring your component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "hwcloud-obs", and is it required for configuration? Also, which group of options does it belong to in terms of its function?'
      answer: |
       'The "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option within the Apache Camel component "hwcloud-obs" is used to enable or disable all consumer-based health checks from this component. Its default value is true, meaning that all consumer health checks are enabled initially. This option is not required for configuration as its inclusion or exclusion does not affect the basic functioning of the component. Lastly, it falls under the "health" group of options in terms of its function, indicating it is related to monitoring the health and status of the component.'
    - question: 'How does the option "healthCheckProducerEnabled" within the Apache Camel component "hwcloud-obs" impact the behavior of producer-based health checks, and what is its default value if this option is not specified when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "healthCheckProducerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "hwcloud-obs" determines whether all producer-based health checks from this specific component are enabled or disabled. By default, Camel has disabled all producer-based health-checks. However, if you wish to enable them globally for all components, you can set `camel.health.producersEnabled=true`. The default value of the "healthCheckProducerEnabled" option within "hwcloud-obs" is true, meaning that producer-based health checks are enabled by default in this component if no explicit value is specified during its usage.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value (if any), data type, requirement level (whether it''s mandatory or not), and group of the Apache Camel component named "hwcloud-obs" option called "bucketName"?'
      answer: |
       'The "bucketName" option within the "hwcloud-obs" component in Apache Camel is a string type (i.e., "type":"string"). Its purpose is to specify the name of the bucket to carry out an operation, although it has no default value (defaultValue: null). While its usage isn''t compulsory (required: false), it falls under the common group of options, indicating it''s a setting frequently used among different components.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''endpoint'' option in the Apache Camel component ''hwcloud-obs'', and can this option accept a default value or is it mandatory to provide one? Also, could you explain why the ''endpoint'' option holds higher precedence than the region parameter based client initialization?'
      answer: |
       'The ''endpoint'' option in the Apache Camel component ''hwcloud-obs'' serves as the OBS (Object Storage Service) URL. This means it provides the location of your Object Storage Service. Although it doesn''t have a default value, providing it is not mandatory as it can be omitted when client initialization is done with region parameters. However, the endpoint option holds higher precedence than the region parameter based client initialization because the OBS URL is considered the primary means to access the service, while the region helps determine the location of the data centers where the service runs. Thus, specifying the endpoint provides a more direct and specific method to access your desired Object Storage Service resources.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the "objectName" option in the Apache Camel component called ''hwcloud-obs'' and is it a required parameter or not?'
      answer: |
       'The "objectName" option in the Apache Camel component named ''hwcloud-obs'' is designed to specify the name of the object with which an operation will be performed. Its default value is null, meaning that you may need to provide an explicit name during usage if necessary. It is not a required parameter, so you have the flexibility to use this option as needed in your integration scenario.'
    - question: 'What is the required string value for the `region` option in the Apache Camel `hwcloud-obs` component, and can there be any default region when not provided? If yes, what is that default value? Also, under which groups does this configuration option fall?'
      answer: |
       'The required string value for the `region` option in the Apache Camel `hwcloud-obs` component cannot have a default value as specified in the information you provided: `"defaultValue": null`. This means that when not provided, it requires an explicit input from the user. The region configuration option falls under the `common` groups of configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "deleteAfterRead" option in the Apache Camel component "hwcloud-obs", and is it required for using this consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "deleteAfterRead" option in the Apache Camel component "hwcloud-obs" is false, meaning that objects are not deleted after they have been retrieved. This option is not required for using the Huawei Cloud Object Storage (hwcloud-obs) consumer.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delimiter" option in the Apache Camel component named ''hwcloud-obs''? And is it marked as required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The delimiter option in the ''hwcloud-obs'' Apache Camel component serves the purpose of specifying the character used for grouping object names within your AWS S3 bucket operations. By default, this value can be null or unspecified. It is marked as an optional field, so you may choose to provide a delimiter if your use case requires one when working with object names in the AWS Object Storage Service (hwcloud-obs).'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "destinationBucket" option in the Apache Camel''s hwcloud-obs component, and is its usage optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "destinationBucket" option within the Apache Camel''s hwcloud-obs component serves as the name of the destination bucket where objects will be moved when the ''moveAfterRead'' setting is enabled. This value is not predefined by default, meaning it must be specified explicitly during configuration. Its usage is optional as indicated by the "required": false in the information provided.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "fileName" option in the Apache Camel "hwcloud-obs" component, and is it mandatory for its usage when working as a consumer group? Also, can you provide the default value for this option if it has one?'
      answer: |
       'The "fileName" option within the Apache Camel "hwcloud-obs" component is designed to allow you to retrieve an object from the bucket using the specified file name. It''s not compulsory, meaning you can use the "hwcloud-obs" as a consumer group without providing this value, but doing so will require a different method to identify the specific object to be accessed. The default value for this option is null, indicating that there is no predefined filename when using the component.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `includeFolders` option to false in the Apache Camel HWCloud-OBS component affect the consumption of objects in folders? Specifically, will any Exchanges be created for ignored folders if this option is set to false?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `includeFolders` option to false in the Apache Camel HWCloud-OBS component means that objects in folders will be ignored, and no Exchanges will be created for those ignored folders. In other words, if this option is set to false, it prevents the consumption of any objects in specified folders and no Exchanges will be generated for them.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum number of messages that can be pulled from an Amazon OBS storage service using Apache Camel''s hwcloud-obs component in one single polling operation, if the option "maxMessagesPerPoll" is not specified explicitly and set to its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The maximum number of messages that can be pulled from an Amazon OBS storage service using Apache Camel''s hwcloud-obs component in one single polling operation, if the option "maxMessagesPerPoll" is not specified explicitly, will be 10 (given its default value).'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel hwcloud-obs component''s moveAfterRead option to move an object to a different bucket after it has been retrieved? And, what are the conditions for this option to function correctly?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the "moveAfterRead" option of the Apache Camel "hwcloud-obs" component so that an object is moved to a different bucket after retrieval, you need to set the value of moveAfterRead to true and specify the destinationBucket where you want to move the object. This option will only function correctly when the destinationBucket has been defined, as mentioned in the documentation. If this condition is not met, the component will not move the object to another bucket.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "prefix" option in the Apache Camel component "hwcloud-obs", and is it required when configuring this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "prefix" option in the Apache Camel component "hwcloud-obs" serves for filtering objects to be listed within the AWS S3 bucket (Object Storage Service). This option does not have a default value, meaning that it is user-defined. Utilization of this parameter is optional when configuring the "hwcloud-obs" component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel "hwcloud-obs" component, and can it be set as a required configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel "hwcloud-obs" component is designed to send an empty message (no body) when the polling consumer does not find any files during its idle time. This option can be beneficial if you want a consistent response even when no data is available. By default, this option is set to false, but it can be enabled if needed. It''s worth noting that this configuration is optional; it is not required in the setup of your Camel route.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel''s `hwcloud-obs` component allow exceptions during message pickup to be handled by the routing Error Handler, and what is the default behavior of this option?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel''s `hwcloud-obs` component enables the bridging of consumer exceptions to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages will now be processed as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler. It''s important to note that this feature requires the 3rd party component to allow Camel notification when an exception is thrown. If the component doesn''t support such functionality, `bridgeErrorHandler` won''t be possible. The default behavior of this option is to use the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler`, which logs exceptions at WARN or ERROR level and ignores them without using the routing Error Handler.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom exception handler using the "exceptionHandler" option in the Apache Camel Hwcloud-obs component, and when is it not in use if the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled? What is the default behavior of this "exceptionHandler" option in terms of logging and ignoring exceptions, and how can I specify a custom exception handler object?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom exception handler using the "exceptionHandler" option in the Apache Camel Hwcloud-obs component, you should ensure that the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is disabled first. The "exceptionHandler" allows you to specify an object which will handle exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level and would otherwise be ignored by default. If "bridgeErrorHandler" is enabled, then the "exceptionHandler" is not utilized as it deals with exceptions instead. You can specify a custom exception handler object as part of your route configuration where the "exceptionHandler" option is present. For instance, in Java DSL:              ```java       from("hwcloud-obs")           .exceptionHandler(new MyCustomExceptionHandler());       ```              In this example, `MyCustomExceptionHandler` should be a custom class that implements the ExceptionHandler interface provided by Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel HWCloud OBS component, and what is its default value, as well as if it is required for usage in consumer operations?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel HWCloud OBS component is designed to set the exchange pattern when a consumer creates an exchange. Its default value is null, meaning there''s no preset exchange pattern. It should be noted that using this option is considered advanced functionality and it''s not required for regular consumption operations, as the component can operate effectively without it if necessary settings are in place.'
    - question: 'How can I implement a custom polling strategy for the Apache Camel component `hwcloud-obs` that will control error handling during the poll operation before an Exchange is created and routed in Camel?'
      answer: |
       'To implement a custom polling strategy for the Apache Camel component `hwcloud-obs` that controls error handling during the poll operation before an Exchange is created and routed, you can provide your own implementation of `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy`. This object allows you to plug in your custom logic to handle errors as per your specific requirements. Since the default value for the pollStrategy option in the `hwcloud-obs` component is null, you''ll need to include this configuration when setting up your Camel route.              Here is an example of how you could configure your custom PollingStrategy:              ```java       from("hwcloud-obs:{{your_obs_uri}}")           .pollStrategy(new CustomPollingStrategy())           ...;              public class CustomPollingStrategy extends DefaultPollingStrategy {                  // Override the required methods to implement your custom error handling logic here              }       ```'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the `bucketLocation` option in the Apache Camel component "hwcloud-obs", if it is not specified during configuration? Also, is the use of this option required when creating a new bucket?'
      answer: |
       'The `bucketLocation` option in the Apache Camel component `hwcloud-obs` doesn''t have a default value. Its purpose is to specify the location (region) where a new bucket should be created when one is being generated. However, its use is not mandatory as setting it to null or omitting it during configuration allows the default location to be determined based on your account settings or other factors specific to the Huawei Cloud Object Storage service. This option falls under the `producer` group in Camel configuration.'
    - question: 'Given the description provided, here''s a question that could be asked about the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component hwcloud-obs:              "In what scenario would it be beneficial to set the ''lazyStartProducer'' option to true for the hwcloud-obs component in an Apache Camel application, and what potential impact might this have on the overall processing time of messages?"'
      answer: |
       'It would be advantageous to set the ''lazyStartProducer'' option to true for the hwcloud-obs component in an Apache Camel application in scenarios where a producer may otherwise fail during starting, potentially causing the route to also fail. By starting the producer lazily (on the first message), you can handle these startup failures using Camel''s routing error handlers, allowing the CamelContext and routes to still start successfully. However, be aware that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time, which could prolong the overall processing time of messages.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel component ''hwcloud-obs'' option called ''proxyHost'', and is its usage mandatory or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The option ''proxyHost'' within the Apache Camel component ''hwcloud-obs'' serves as a placeholder for a proxy server''s IP address or hostname when using a proxy server. The default value of this option is null, indicating that it may or may not be used based on your specific setup requirements. The usage of this option is optional; however, if you need to utilize a proxy server while working with ''hwcloud-obs'', then setting an appropriate value for ''proxyHost'' would be necessary.'
    - question: 'How is the "proxyPassword" option in Apache Camel''s hwcloud-obs component configured when using proxy for file transfers, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyPassword" option in Apache Camel''s hwcloud-obs component serves as the authentication password when utilizing a proxy for file transfers. Its presence is optional, meaning you can configure the component without providing this value if your system doesn''t require proxy authentication. However, when you do need to supply it, simply set the "proxyPassword" property according to your configuration requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the default value, data type, and required status for the Apache Camel component ''hwcloud-obs'' option named ''proxyPort'', and what group of options does it belong to that may or may not be specified when using this option?'
      answer: |
       'The ''hwcloud-obs'' Apache Camel component''s ''proxyPort'' option has a default value of null, which means it is optional. Its data type is an integer. This option belongs to the group "proxy", so you may or may not specify this group when using the ''proxyPort'' option.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it''s required for the ''proxyUser'' option in the Apache Camel component named ''hwcloud-obs'', under the group category called ''proxy''?'
      answer: |
       'The ''proxyUser'' option in the Apache Camel component ''hwcloud-obs'', within the group category ''proxy'', is designed to provide a proxy authentication user. It''s not set with a default value (defaultValue: null). The data type for this option is string (type: "string"), and it''s optional, as specified by the ''required'': false.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel component "hwcloud-obs", and when is it considered optional to configure this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel component "hwcloud-obs" determines the number of consecutive error polls that should occur before the "backoffMultipler" takes effect, which adjusts the interval for subsequent retries after an error. By default, there is no predefined value for this option, allowing you to configure it according to your application''s needs. It can be considered optional if you do not intend to handle multiple errors or delays before retrying, although it''s essential to keep in mind that proper error handling is crucial when working with the Object Storage service.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) for the ''backoffIdleThreshold'' option in the ''hwcloud-obs'' component''s scheduler group within Apache Camel, and when is its use optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s ''hwcloud-obs'' component, the ''backoffIdleThreshold'' option determines the number of idle polls that should occur before the ''backoffMultipler'' kicks in. This option allows you to configure the duration of consecutive idle polling events before a backoff multiplier is applied to slow down the rate of subsequent polls. The default value for this option is not set, as it can be configured according to your specific use-case needs. Its use within the ''scheduler'' group is optional, meaning you may choose to specify it or not, depending on whether you wish to customize the idle threshold before the backoff mechanism takes effect.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel component `hwcloud-obs` option named `backoffMultiplier`, and under what circumstances should the options `backoffIdleThreshold` and/or `backoffErrorThreshold` also be configured if this option is in use?'
      answer: |
       'The `backoffMultiplier` option for the Apache Camel component `hwcloud-obs` is designed to facilitate a backoff mechanism when the scheduled polling consumer encounters a series of subsequent idles or errors. This multiplier dictates the number of skipped polls before the next attempt is made again. It''s important to note that if `backoffMultiplier` is used, both `backoffIdleThreshold` and/or `backoffErrorThreshold` must also be configured. These additional options specify the number of consecutive idle or error events required to initiate a backoff according to the defined thresholds. This mechanism helps manage high loads and prevents excessive polling attempts under adverse conditions. The default value for `backoffMultiplier` is null, meaning it can take any positive integer value depending on your specific use case.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and required status of the "delay" option in the Apache Camel component named "hwcloud-obs", under the group "scheduler", if not provided with a custom value?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component named "hwcloud-obs", the "delay" option belongs to the group "scheduler". This option defines a time delay (in milliseconds) before the next poll, with a default value of 500 milliseconds. The data type for this option is "integer", which means only numerical values are acceptable. The "required" status is set to false, indicating that providing a custom value for this option is optional.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel component named "hwcloud-obs" affect the behavior of the ScheduledPollConsumer, and when is its default value false?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel component "hwcloud-obs" means that if a message or more messages are polled during a previous run of the ScheduledPollConsumer, it will be triggered to run again immediately. Its default value is false, meaning that it won''t run repeatedly based on the greedy behavior when not enabled. This configuration falls under the "scheduler" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel component "hwcloud-obs" when used within the scheduler group? Also, is it a required option, and what data type should it have?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s "hwcloud-obs" component when working within the "scheduler" group, the "initialDelay" option serves to specify the milliseconds before the first poll starts. By default, this option is set to a delay of 1000 milliseconds or one second. The data type for this option is an integer. It''s not a required option, meaning you can omit it if you wish for the immediate start of the first poll.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `repeatCount` option in the Apache Camel component "hwcloud-obs", and what values can be set for it, including its default value, possible data type, and whether its usage is optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'The `repeatCount` option in the Apache Camel component "hwcloud-obs" serves to specify a maximum limit for the number of times an event or task is repeated by the scheduler. A value greater than zero sets the repetition count; if set to 1, for instance, the scheduler will fire only once. Setting it to 5 would result in the scheduler firing five times. It''s important to note that a value of zero or negative means that the task will continuously fire (or "forever"). The `repeatCount` option is an integer data type and its usage is optional, not required by default, as you may find it useful when managing repeatable tasks within your application grouped under the scheduler.'
    - question: 'What is the default logging level for the ''start/complete'' logs generated by the Apache Camel component ''hwcloud-obs'' when it polls, and what options are available to configure the logging level beyond its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The default logging level for the ''start/complete'' logs generated by the Apache Camel component ''hwcloud-obs'' when it polls is set to TRACE. You can configure the logging level for these log lines beyond this default value using the option ''runLoggingLevel''. This option allows you to customize the logging level to suit your needs, making it possible to reduce or increase the verbosity of the logs according to your preference or requirements.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom thread pool for the consumer in Apache Camel''s hwcloud-obs component using the option named `scheduledExecutorService`? Is it necessary to provide a default value and if not, what groups does this option belong to?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom thread pool for the consumer in Apache Camel''s hwcloud-obs component, you can utilize the option called `scheduledExecutorService`. This option allows you to specify a shared thread pool that the consumer will use. By default, each consumer uses its own single-threaded thread pool. However, providing a default value for this option is optional. The group where this option belongs to is named "scheduler".'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel `hwcloud-obs` component''s `scheduler` option to utilize a cron scheduler when using the `camel-spring` or `camel-quartz` components, and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'To use a cron scheduler in your Apache Camel `hwcloud-obs` component, specifically when utilizing the `camel-spring` or `camel-quartz` components, you should set the "scheduler" option''s value to either "spring" or "quartz". These values represent the built-in schedulers provided by the corresponding Camel components. However, it''s important to note that there is no default value for this option. You can choose to use a scheduler by configuring this option according to your application''s requirements.'
    - question: 'How can I set custom properties for a custom scheduler or one of the Quartz or Spring-based schedulers in the Apache Camel Hwcloud-obs component? Is it possible to specify this using the "schedulerProperties" option and if so, what is the correct format for providing these properties?'
      answer: |
       'To set custom properties for a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz or Spring-based schedulers in the Apache Camel Hwcloud-obs component, you can use the "schedulerProperties" option. The correct format involves providing this option as an object containing your desired key-value pairs, such as:              ```json       {         "cron": "0 0 1 * * ?",  // example for a Quartz cron schedule         "fixedRate": "1000",    // example for a Spring fixed rate schedule         "fixedDelay": "2000"   // example for a Spring fixed delay schedule       }       ```              It''s essential to remember that the "schedulerProperties" option is not mandatory and its use depends on whether or not you need additional properties beyond those provided by default.'
    - question: 'Here is a question that can be answered using the provided information about the Apache Camel component `hwcloud-obs` and its option `startScheduler`:              What is the default behavior of the "startScheduler" option in the `hwcloud-obs` component in Apache Camel, meaning will it auto start if this option is not explicitly configured? Also, is configuring this option as a boolean value required or optional? Finally, is there a specific group that this option belongs to?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "startScheduler" option in the `hwcloud-obs` component in Apache Camel is for it to auto-start if not explicitly configured. This option is of boolean type and its configuration is optional, meaning you can leave it as it is without affecting its initial behavior. Lastly, this option belongs to the "scheduler" group within the component''s configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default time unit used by the "initialDelay" and "delay" options in the Apache Camel "hwcloud-obs" component, and can the use of these options be configured to specify a different time unit? Furthermore, what are the available groups where this option belongs?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel "hwcloud-obs" component, the default time unit for both the "initialDelay" and "delay" options is set to MILLISECONDS. However, it is possible to configure these options to specify a different time unit as they support various time units such as SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS, or even DAYS. The group where this option belongs is under "scheduler".'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and purpose of the "useFixedDelay" option within the Apache Camel component ''hwcloud-obs'', and when should this option be explicitly set to false?'
      answer: |
       'The "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel component ''hwcloud-obs'' determines whether a fixed delay or fixed rate is employed. When set to true by default, it uses a fixed delay between invocations, meaning the next processing will start after the specified time elapses since the previous one.
