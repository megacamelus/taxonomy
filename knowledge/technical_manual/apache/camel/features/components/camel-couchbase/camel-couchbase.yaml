    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel Couchbase component so that any exceptions during message pickup by the consumer are processed as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler, using the bridgeErrorHandler option? Furthermore, if it''s possible to achieve this configuration, will it be necessary for my specific use case, considering that the default exception handling deals with exceptions at the WARN or ERROR level and ignores them?'
      answer: |
       'To configure Apache Camel Couchbase component so that any exceptions during message pickup by the consumer are processed as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler, you can use the "bridgeErrorHandler" option. Set it to `true` to enable this functionality. Here''s an example:              ```xml       <couchbase:endpoint bridgeErrorHandler="true" ... />       ```              However, this is only possible if the third-party Couchbase component supports such behavior. If your specific Couchbase component manages exceptions internally and does not allow Camel to be alerted when an exception was thrown, bridgeErrorHandler will not work.              If you choose to use the bridgeErrorHandler option, note that it may override the default exception handling where exceptions are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. Therefore, using bridgeErrorHandler might only be necessary if your application requires a more comprehensive error handling strategy for specific situations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and implications of setting the "lazyStartProducer" option to true for the Apache Camel component Couchbase, and what is the default value and group associated with this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component allows you to defer the start of the producer until the first message is processed. This can be useful when a producer may otherwise fail during starting, preventing the route from being started. By using lazy startup, failure due to producer initialization can be handled through Camel''s routing error handlers.              However, it''s important to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer will take additional time, potentially increasing the overall processing time of the route. This option is configured as a boolean, with the default value being false (meaning the producer starts immediately), and it falls under the "producer" group.'
    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the `autowiredEnabled` option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component impact the configuration of its instances, particularly in relation to automatically configuring data sources or clients like AWS?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the `autowiredEnabled` option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component allows for automatic autowiring of components when marked as autowired, making it simpler to configure instances like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, or even additional Couchbase instances themselves. When this feature is switched on, Camel will automatically look up and inject the required instance at runtime by scanning the registry for a single match of the specified component type.              However, when you disable `autowiredEnabled`, you must manually configure each Couchbase instance in your application. This means you would be responsible for setting up data sources, clients, or other connections that rely on Couchbase yourself, rather than allowing Camel to handle this task automatically.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and under which configuration group can it be set as optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option within the Apache Camel Couchbase component serves to enable or disable all consumer-based health checks originating from this component. Its default value is true, meaning that health checks are enabled by default. This configuration option can be found under the "health" group, which governs various aspects related to system health and monitoring, allowing it to be set as optional if desired.'
    - question: 'How does one configure the Apache Camel Couchbase component to disable all producer-based health checks from this component, and is there a default setting for this option?'
      answer: |
       'To disable all producer-based health checks from the Apache Camel Couchbase component, you can set the "healthCheckProducerEnabled" option to false in your configuration. By default, this option is already set to true, which means producer checks are enabled. However, since Camel has disabled all producer-based health checks by default, if you want to turn off the producer checks specifically for the Couchbase component, you''ll need to explicitly set "healthCheckProducerEnabled" to false in your Couchbase configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the mandatory, string-typed, required configuration option within the Apache Camel Couchbase component that specifies the name of the Couchbase bucket to use in a route?'
      answer: |
       'The mandatory, string-typed configuration option within the Apache Camel Couchbase component is "bucket". This option specifies the name of the Couchbase bucket to use in a route. It is required, meaning it must be provided for the component to function correctly.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "collection" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component and is it required? Also, can you provide an example of how this option may be set when using the component if a default collection has not been specified?'
      answer: |
       'The "collection" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is intended to specify which collection within your Couchbase cluster to use for data operations. This option is optional, meaning it''s not required for the component to function; if a default collection has not been set, you may continue without providing this value. When defining your integration using the Couchbase component, you can set the "collection" option to specify which collection to use as follows:              ```xml       <couchbase:endpoint uri="couchbase://localhost/mybucket?collection=myCollection">           <!-- Your integration logic here -->       </couchbase:endpoint>       ```              In this example, the endpoint is connecting to a Couchbase server running locally, using the ''mybucket'' bucket (database), and interacting with the ''myCollection'' collection. Adjust these values based on your specific use case and cluster configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value (if any), data type, optional nature, and group affiliation of the "key" option within the Apache Camel component named ''couchbase''?'
      answer: |
       'The "key" option within the Couchbase component in Apache Camel is a string data type that specifies the key to use for the operation. It has no default value and can be set at runtime if required. Its optional nature allows for flexibility when interacting with your Couchbase server. This option falls under the common group of settings within the Couchbase component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "scope" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and is it optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'The "scope" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is designed to specify the scope for operations within a bucket. It doesn''t have a default value (defaultValue: null). Whether this option is used or not depends on your requirements, as it is optional rather than required. The group it belongs to is "common".'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the Apache Camel Couchbase component''s `consumerProcessedStrategy` option and what possible string values can it take, if specified, in regards to defining the consumer processed strategy?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "consumerProcessedStrategy" option of the Apache Camel CouchBase component is "none". If specified, this option can accept string values that define the consumer processed strategy. Possible string values include but are not limited to: "acknowledge", "ackedAcknowledge", "publish", "autoAck", and "transactional" depending on the specific requirement for handling consumer acknowledgement and processing in your application.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "descending" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and is it required when using the consumer group?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "descending" option in the Apache Camel CouchBase component is false. Using this option is not required when working with the consumer group, as it''s marked as optional.'
    - question: 'What is the default design document name used by the Apache Camel Couchbase component if the option ''designDocumentName'' is not explicitly provided while setting up a consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The default design document name used by the Apache Camel Couchbase component when the option ''designDocumentName'' is not explicitly provided while setting up a consumer is "beer".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel Couchbase component''s "fullDocument" option in relation to the behavior of a Camel consumer, when not explicitly specified?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of an Apache Camel consumer, the "fullDocument" option for the Couchbase component determines whether the consumer will return the complete document or just the data defined within a view when not explicitly specified. By default, this option is set to false, meaning the returned data will only include what''s defined in the view and not the entire document. However, if you set it to true, the consumer will instead return the full document.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''limit'' option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component when it comes to configuring consumers, and what is its default value and data type? Is it mandatory or optional to set this parameter? If it is optional, are there specific groups where setting it would be useful or appropriate?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s Couchbase component, the ''limit'' option is used to configure the output limit when working with consumers. This means that you can control the number of documents retrieved at a time from your Couchbase bucket. The default value for this option is -1, indicating there is no limit on the number of documents returned. It''s an optional parameter as denoted by ''required'': false, meaning it can be set or omitted in configuration. Setting it would be useful for consumer groups where you want to control the flow or the amount of data processed at once, for example, when dealing with high volumes of data.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''rangeEndKey'' option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component and does it have a default value, if it''s not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The ''rangeEndKey'' option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component allows you to define a range for the end key in your operations. It is an optional string parameter that does not have a default value, meaning if it''s not specified, its value will be null.'
    - question: 'How is it possible to configure a range for the start key when using the Apache Camel Couchbase consumer, if the use of this feature is optional?'
      answer: |
       'When utilizing the Apache Camel Couchbase consumer, you can define a range for the start key of your operation by configuring the `rangeStartKey` component option. This feature allows you to specify a starting point in the range of keys within your Couchbase bucket, facilitating more granular access to data. It''s essential to note that using this option is optional, as it can be skipped if not needed for your use case. If you decide to employ the `rangeStartKey`, simply set it as a string value in your consumer configuration when creating the Couchbase component.'
    - question: 'Here is a question related to the Apache Camel Couchbase component''s "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option:              "What is the purpose of the ''sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle'' option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and can it be set to true to send an empty message if no files are polled by the consumer?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle'' option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is designed to manage messages when the polling consumer does not find any files to process during its scheduled polling interval. You can enable this option to have an empty message (no body) sent instead, which could be useful for notifying downstream components about the lack of data or for maintaining a consistent flow in your integration pipeline. The default value is false, but if you choose to set it to true, the component will send an empty message when no files are polled by the consumer.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "skip" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, when this option is configured in the consumer group?'
      answer: |
       'The "skip" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, when configured within the consumer group, has an integer data type with a default value of -1. This option defines the number of documents to skip before processing any further. If not provided or set to -1, it instructs the component to start from the beginning of the collection.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the option "viewName" in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and can it be omitted if not provided? (Answer: The default value is "brewery_beers", and it can be omitted as it is an optional parameter.)'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the option "viewName" in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is "brewery_beers". It''s a string data type, and it can be omitted if not provided since it is an optional parameter.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the Apache Camel Couchbase component to handle exceptions occurring during message pickup using the routing Error Handler, if supported by the third-party library? And could you explain when this bridgeErrorHandler option is set to true or false?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel Couchbase component to handle exceptions during message pickup using the routing Error Handler, you can set the "bridgeErrorHandler" option to true. This will allow any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages to be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.              However, it''s important to note that this is only possible if the third-party component supports alerting Camel when an exception is thrown. Some components may handle exceptions internally only, in which case setting "bridgeErrorHandler" to true will not be feasible. In such situations, the consumer will use the default exception handling provided by Apache Camel, logging exceptions at WARN or ERROR level and ignoring them.              When "bridgeErrorHandler" is set to false (which is the default), the Camel component will continue to use its own exception handling mechanism as mentioned above. By setting it to true, you are specifically enabling the connection between the consumer and the Camel routing Error Handler for exceptions that may occur during message pickup.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the exceptionHandler option within the Apache Camel Couchbase component, when it should be used in relation to the consumer, its default behavior, and how it interacts with the bridgeErrorHandler option?'
      answer: |
       'The exceptionHandler option within the Apache Camel Couchbase component allows consumers to utilize a custom ExceptionHandler. This option comes into play when you want to manage exceptions that arise during operation in a way tailored to your specific use case. It''s essential to note that if the bridgeErrorHandler is enabled, the exceptionHandler option will not be utilized.              By default, Camel''s consumer will handle exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. However, when you implement a custom ExceptionHandler through the exceptionHandler option, you have more control over how exceptions are handled in your application. This can include logging, retrying, modifying behavior based on the specific type of exception, and more.              The interaction between exceptionHandler and bridgeErrorHandler is that bridgeErrorHandler, when enabled, takes control of error handling for all components in the route. In this scenario, any custom exceptionHandler set for individual components (like Couchbase) will not be executed, as the focus shifts to the centralized error handling provided by the bridgeErrorHandler option. To make use of a custom ExceptionHandler within your consumer, ensure that the bridgeErrorHandler is disabled. The exceptionHandler option is available under advanced configurations, specifically in the ''consumer (advanced)'' group.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the ''exchangePattern'' option when using the Apache Camel Couchbase component in a scenario where no custom value is specified for it, and where does this option belong in terms of required configuration settings?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the Apache Camel Couchbase component, if no explicit value is provided for the ''exchangePattern'' option, its default behavior will be undefined (null). This option falls under the advanced group of configuration settings, specifically within the consumer settings, where it can be utilized to set an exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and when is it typically used (indicating its group in the documentation)?'
      answer: |
       'The `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is a customizable pluggable implementation of `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy`. This allows you to provide your own logic for handling errors that might occur during the poll operation before an Exchange has been created and routed in Camel. The default value for this option is null, meaning no custom strategy is set by default. You can find details about its usage under the "consumer (advanced)" group in the documentation.'
    - question: '"In regards to the Apache Camel Couchbase component, what is the default value for the ''autoStartIdForInserts'' option and under which group of properties does it belong in a producer context?"'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the ''autoStartIdForInserts'' option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is false. This property belongs to the "producer" group of settings when managing insert operations.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "operation" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component when not explicitly set, and which group of options does it belong to (producer or consumer)?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "operation" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is "CCB_PUT" when not explicitly set. It falls under the "producer" group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the default and optional value for the Apache Camel Couchbase component option "persistTo" when using a producer, and can it be specified as a group? (Hint: The ''persistTo'' option specifies where to persist data in a Couchbase bucket.)'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel Couchbase component option "persistTo" when using a producer is 0, which means that the data will not be explicitly persisted. However, it can be optionally set to an integer value to specify where in the Couchbase bucket the data should be persisted. Additionally, the ''persistTo'' option can be specified as part of the "producer" group when configuring the component.'
    - question: 'How many times will the Couchbase Camel component producer attempt to resend a message if the production fails, given that it is configurable and the default value is set to 2?'
      answer: |
       'The Couchbase Camel component producer will attempt to resend a message up to 2 times in case of failure, as this parameter is configurable with a default value of 2.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type, as well as whether it''s required or optional for the Apache Camel component Couchbase configuration option "producerRetryPause", which defines the retry pause between different attempts? Is it an integer, and does it have a default value if not specified? And can this option be found in the producer group of settings?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel component Couchbase''s configuration option "producerRetryPause" is an optional (requires: false) integer type, with a default value of 5000 milliseconds (or 5 seconds). This setting defines the retry pause between different attempts. You can find it under the producer group of settings in the configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and optional value range for the Apache Camel component Couchbase''s replicateTo option when using it in a producer context, if the user decides not to specify this option?'
      answer: |
       'The `replicateTo` option within the Apache Camel Couchbase component is designed to determine where data should be replicated when being produced. If a user chooses not to specify this option, it defaults to 0, indicating that no explicit replication will occur. However, it''s essential to note that data may still be replicated based on Couchbase''s default replication settings if they are configured.'
    - question: 'How do I define the starting point for my Couchbase inserts using the Apache Camel''s "couchbase" component, and is it mandatory to provide this value? Also, what is the default value for the option named "startingIdForInsertsFrom"?'
      answer: |
       'To define the starting point for your Couchbase inserts using Apache Camel''s "couchbase" component, you can use the option called "startingIdForInsertsFrom". This option is used to specify where the insert operation should begin. However, it is not mandatory to provide this value as its default is null. The group this option belongs to is "producer".'
    - question: 'Given the documentation provided, here''s a question that could be asked:              "What is the purpose of the ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component and under what scenarios might it be beneficial to set it to true?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component allows you to defer the starting of a producer until the first message is processed. This can be useful when a producer might otherwise fail during start-up, causing the route to also fail being started. By setting it to true, you can handle the startup failure through Camel''s routing error handlers instead of preventing the entire route from starting. However, please note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time, thereby increasing the total processing time of the processing.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "additionalHosts" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and is it necessary or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "additionalHosts" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component allows you to specify additional Couchbase servers to connect to, beyond the primary one defined during configuration. While not required, this option falls under the "advanced" group, indicating that it''s optional and mainly useful in scenarios where load balancing or redundancy is essential. It accepts string values for each additional host, separated by commas.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible range for the connectTimeout option within the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and is its usage mandatory or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "connectTimeout" option within the Apache Camel Couchbase component defines the timeout duration (in milliseconds) for connecting to a Couchbase server. Its default value is 30000ms (or 30 seconds), and it can be set to any positive integer value depending on your specific use case. The usage of this option is optional, being classified under the "advanced" group of options in Camel''s configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the Apache Camel component Couchbase option named `queryTimeout`, and what type of value should it be when specified by the user? Also, is specifying this option required or optional within a route configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel component Couchbase option named `queryTimeout` is 2500 milliseconds (2.5 seconds). When you specify this option in your route configuration, it should be of type "duration" indicating a time interval measured in milliseconds. Specifying this option is optional as it falls under the advanced group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and are there any prerequisites or group requirements for its usage?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is used to specify the number of subsequent error polls that should occur before the "backoffMultiplier" kicks in. This means it determines how many times a failure should be retried before adjusting the retry interval. By default, this value is not set ("defaultValue": null). However, its usage is optional as indicated by the "required": false. It''s important to note that this option falls under the "scheduler" group of configurations. This implies that it concerns how the component manages and schedules its operations.'
    - question: '"In relation to the Apache Camel component ''couchbase'', what does the option ''backoffIdleThreshold'' represent, and what is its default value or range of acceptable values if any, particularly when grouped with the ''scheduler''?"'
      answer: |
       'In relation to the Apache Camel Couchbase component, the option ''backoffIdleThreshold'' represents the number of idle polls that should occur before the backoffMultiplier comes into play. The default value for this option is not specified (null), but it''s an integer value. It''s particularly relevant when grouped with the ''scheduler'', as it concerns the scheduling behavior in Couchbase operations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel component Couchbase''s "backoffMultiplier" option, how should it be used in conjunction with other options, what is its default value, data type and group, and is it required for configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffMultiplier" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component serves to let a scheduled polling consumer temporarily halt operations if there has been a series of idle or error events. This multiplier signifies the number of skipped polls before the next operation is attempted again. For optimal use, it''s essential that the "backoffIdleThreshold" and/or "backoffErrorThreshold" options are also configured along with this option. By default, this value has no set default, making it optional for configuration but highly recommended when dealing with scenarios involving consecutive idle or error occurrences in a polling sequence, which falls under the "scheduler" group within the Couchbase component settings.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the "milliseconds before the next poll" for a Couchbase poll in Apache Camel, when using the "scheduler" group and this setting is optional? The default value is 500 milliseconds.'
      answer: |
       'To configure the "milliseconds before the next poll" for a Couchbase component in Apache Camel under the "scheduler" group, you can use the "delay" option, which defines the time interval (in milliseconds) between polling requests. The default value is set to 500 milliseconds, but it can be adjusted as per your requirements. This configuration is optional since setting a delay is not essential for executing Couchbase operations. You can update your scheduler configuration accordingly in your Apache Camel route, such as:              ```xml       from("scheduler:my-cron-expression")        .pollDelay(<your custom milliseconds value>)        .to("couchbase:your-bucket-name?delay=<your custom milliseconds value>&...")       ;       ```'
    - question: 'What is the effect of enabling the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component when using a ScheduledPollConsumer, and does it have a default value?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, when used with a ScheduledPollConsumer, means that if the previous run of the consumer polled one or more messages, it will run immediately again. This behavior is not mandatory, as the default value for this option is false. The "greedy" option can be found under the scheduler group in configuration settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it''s required for the `initialDelay` option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component under the scheduler group, and can you explain what milliseconds before the first poll starts means?'
      answer: |
       'The `initialDelay` option within the Apache Camel Couchbase component, under the scheduler group, is an integer type value with a default of 1000 milliseconds. Its purpose is to specify the duration (in milliseconds) before the first poll starts after the scheduler has been initiated or resumed. This allows for a brief pause at the beginning of polling cycles, which can be useful for various reasons such as ensuring data consistency when working with distributed databases like Couchbase. Whether `initialDelay` is required to use this component is optional.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum number of times a process using the Apache Camel Couchbase component will execute if the repeatCount option is set to 5, and what happens if it''s set to zero or negative?'
      answer: |
       'In response to your query, if you set the repeatCount option for the Apache Camel Couchbase component to 5, the process using this component will execute a maximum of 5 times. This is because the repeatCount option specifies the maximum limit of fires or executions. If you set it to zero or negative, the scheduler will fire forever as this indicates an infinite loop without any specified limit for executing the process.'
    - question: 'What is the default value of the `runLoggingLevel` option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and what purpose does this option serve in controlling the logs generated during polling?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `runLoggingLevel` option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is TRACE. This option controls the logging level for start/complete log lines generated when the component polls. By configuring this option, you can manage the verbosity of the logs that are generated during polling, allowing you to tailor your logs to better suit your needs based on the desired level of detail and visibility into the polling process.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel Couchbase option named "scheduledExecutorService", and can it be used without being set if its group is labeled as ''scheduler''?'
      answer: |
       'The "scheduledExecutorService" option in Apache Camel''s Couchbase component allows you to configure a custom or shared thread pool for the consumer. By default, each consumer uses its own single-threaded thread pool. This option is optional and can be set within the ''scheduler'' group of settings. If not explicitly provided, it will operate without this service using the default configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the method to configure and utilize the Cron Scheduler option within the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and are there any default values for this configuration? And which group does the scheduler option belong to in the Camel Couchbase component settings?'
      answer: |
       'To configure and use the Cron Scheduler option within the Apache Camel Couchbase component, you can utilize either camel-spring or camel-quartz components. The value "spring" or "quartz" should be provided to include the built-in scheduler for your preference. It is essential to note that by default, no values are set for this configuration. Additionally, the scheduler option falls under the "scheduler" group in the Camel Couchbase component settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "schedulerProperties" option within the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and when can it be used without a specified value?'
      answer: |
       'The "schedulerProperties" option within the Apache Camel Couchbase component is designed to allow you to configure additional properties when utilizing a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz, Spring-based schedulers. It''s an object type property, meaning it can accommodate multiple key-value pairs if needed. The default value for this option is null, implying that you don''t have to specify a value if you don''t want to make any additional configuration changes. This option can be used without a specified value in scenarios where the default scheduling behavior of Apache Camel Couchbase is sufficient for your needs. However, if you need to customize the scheduling properties, you can provide an appropriate object containing the necessary configurations.'
    - question: 'How does one configure the Apache Camel Couchbase component to specify whether the scheduler should not automatically start upon initialization?'

       'To configure the Apache Camel Couchbase component and prevent the scheduler from auto-starting upon initialization, you need to set the "startScheduler" option to false when using the component. Here''s an example of how to do this:              ```       from("couchbase:myQueue")           .component(new CouchBaseComponent(yourCluster))           .option(CouchBaseComponent.StartScheduler, false);       ```              In the code snippet above, `CouchBaseComponent.StartScheduler` is a constant that points to the "startScheduler" option, and by setting it to false, you can prevent the scheduler from being automatically started when initializing the Couchbase component.'
    - question: 'What is the default time unit (Milliseconds, Seconds, Minutes or Hours) for the "initialDelay" and "delay" options in the Apache Camel Couchbase component''s scheduler group, if the "timeUnit" option is not specified explicitly?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel Couchbase component''s scheduler group, when the "timeUnit" option is not explicitly specified, the default time unit for both the "initialDelay" and "delay" options is Milliseconds (MILLISECONDS).'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the Apache Camel Couchbase component''s "useFixedDelay" option, and under what circumstances can it be set to false instead of its default value (if applicable)?'
      answer: |
       'The "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component serves to control whether a fixed delay or a fixed rate is used in the scheduler. When set to true by default, it implies a fixed delay between tasks, meaning that each task will be executed with a specific time gap after its preceding one. However, you can opt to set it to false if you prefer using a fixed rate, which ensures that each task is executed within a specified time period regardless of the previous task''s completion time. This option follows the behavior of ScheduledExecutorService in JDK. Its use is entirely optional and can be customized based on your specific requirements within the "scheduler" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and required status of the ''password'' option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and where does this option fit within the group(s) of settings?'
      answer: |
       'The ''password'' option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is a string-type setting, used to specify the password for authentication when interacting with Couchbase. By default, it does not have a value (defaultValue: null). This option is not required but falls under the security group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the optional username value for authenticating with a Couchbase server when using the Apache Camel component, if not provided explicitly? (Given that the default value is null)'
      answer: |
       'The optional username value for authenticating with a Couchbase server when using the Apache Camel component is not provided explicitly by default. In case you wish to use a username, it needs to be set manually since the default value is null.'
