    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel Couchbase component''s bridgeErrorHandler option work, and when is it necessary to set it to true in order to allow exceptions occurred while consuming messages to be processed by the routing Error Handler?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel Couchbase component''s "bridgeErrorHandler" option allows for integrating the consumer with the Camel routing Error Handler, enabling any exceptions that might occur during message consumption to be treated as messages and handled by the Error Handler. However, this feature is only applicable if the 3rd party component (in this case, Couchbase) permits Camel to receive exception information. If the component manages exceptions internally, the bridgeErrorHandler is not usable. When it''s necessary to set the bridgeErrorHandler option to true would be when you want such exceptions to be processed by the Error Handler instead of being logged and ignored by default. Keep in mind that this functionality may not always be available depending on the specifics of your 3rd party component, and improvements to the Camel component might make it possible in future releases.'
    - question: 'How does configuring the "lazyStartProducer" option in Apache Camel''s Couchbase component impact the startup behavior, performance, and error handling of Camel routes? And what is the default value for this option and can it be configured as optional during the setup process?'
      answer: |
       'Configuring the "lazyStartProducer" option in Apache Camel''s Couchbase component allows you to control how producers are started within your Camel routes. By setting it to true, you enable a lazy start for the producer, meaning it will only be initiated when the first message is processed rather than during CamelContext and route startup. This setup can help manage situations where a producer might otherwise fail during starting, potentially causing the entire route to fail as well.              Error handling is improved because any issues with producing data are deferred until actual message processing begins, allowing you to handle these errors using Camel''s routing error handlers. However, be aware that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some additional time, thereby increasing overall processing time.              The default value for the "lazyStartProducer" option in this component is false. You can choose to configure it as optional during setup by leaving its value as false, allowing you to decide whether to utilize a lazy start producer in your specific use case. The "groups" attribute indicates that this configuration option belongs to the "producer" group.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and can it be configured as optional or required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is a boolean setting that determines whether autowiring is enabled by default. Autowiring allows for automatic configuration of components like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc., by looking up in the registry to find a single instance of matching type. The default value of ''autowiredEnabled'' is true. This option can be configured as optional since its default value is already set, but it can also be explicitly set to false if manual configuration is preferred. It falls under the advanced group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and can it be disabled if needed? Additionally, where does this option fall under in terms of its required usage and grouping with other options?'
      answer: |
       'The "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is used for enabling or disabling all consumer-based health checks from this component. By default, it is set to true, meaning that consumer-based health checks are enabled. If needed, you can disable this option by setting its value to false. This option falls under the "health" group and is not required for the normal operation of the Couchbase component.'
    - question: 'How does one configure the Apache Camel Couchbase component to enable or disable producer-based health checks, and what is the default value for this configuration option (`healthCheckProducerEnabled`) if left unspecified?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel Couchbase component regarding producer-based health checks, you can use the `healthCheckProducerEnabled` option. Setting this boolean to true enables all producer-based health checks from the Couchbase component. By default, Camel has disabled these producer-based health checks. However, if you wish to turn on producer checks globally, you can set `camel.health.producersEnabled=true`. If you do not specify the `healthCheckProducerEnabled` option for the Couchbase component, it will default to true, following the global Camel configuration setting.'
    - question: 'What is the required, string-typed option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component that specifies the bucket to be used for operations?'
      answer: |
       'The required, string-typed option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component that specifies the bucket to be used for operations is called "bucket". This means you must provide a valid string value for this option when configuring your Couchbase operations.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "collection" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and is it necessary to specify this option when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "collection" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is null, meaning no collection will be used by default if you don''t specify one. However, it''s not necessary to always provide a collection as it depends on your use case; you can choose to specify a collection when using this component if desired.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "key" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, if a user decides not to provide a specific key value?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s Couchbase component, the "key" option specifies the key to use when interacting with the Couchbase server. If a user chooses not to provide a specific key value, it is set as null by default, meaning the component will use an automatically generated key for the operation.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and required status of the "scope" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and what kind of data should be provided for this option if a value is specified? (The option description suggests it''s a string, but I would like to confirm.)'
      answer: |
       'The "scope" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component has a default value of null and is not required. If you choose to specify a value for this option, it should be a string representing the scope to use in your Couchbase bucket.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and allowed data type of the Apache Camel Couchbase component option named "consumerProcessedStrategy", and is it required when using this option? Also, can you explain what purpose this option serves in the context of the Couchbase component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "consumerProcessedStrategy" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is "none". This option allows you to define the consumer Processed strategy to use, which determines how the consumer acknowledges processed messages. It is an optional setting as indicated by the "required": false property. The purpose of this option within the Couchbase component context is to control message processing and acknowledgement behavior when using the Couchbase component as a message consumer in Apache Camel routing.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and is it required for the Apache Camel Couchbase component option named "descending", and can you describe its purpose within the context of consumer operations?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel CouchBase component option named "descending" is `false`. It''s not a required option, meaning it can be omitted if you don''t need to perform descending sorting in your operations. Its purpose within the context of consumer operations is to define whether an operation should be performed in descending order or not when interacting with CouchBase data.'
    - question: 'What is the default design document name used when not specified, for the Couchbase component in Apache Camel, and what type of value should it be?'
      answer: |
       'The default design document name used when not specified for the Couchbase component in Apache Camel is "beer". As indicated, this value should be a string type.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel Couchbase component option named "fullDocument", and is it required when using this component''s consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel Couchbase component option named "fullDocument" determines whether the consumer will return the complete document instead of just the data defined in a view. If set to true, the returned document will include all fields of the document. By default, this option is false, meaning the consumer will return only the specified data from the view. Using it is optional when employing the Couchbase component''s consumer.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "limit" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and is its usage mandatory or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "limit" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is an optional setting designed to restrict the number of items returned from a query. By default, this limit is set to -1, indicating there is no limit on the output. This option can be particularly useful when dealing with large datasets to control memory usage or processing time. The group associated with this option is "consumer".'
    - question: 'How do you define or set a specific range for the end key when using the Apache Camel Couchbase consumer component, and is it mandatory to provide this value? (Hint: The option is named "rangeEndKey", and its default value is null.)'
      answer: |
       'In the context of the Apache Camel Couchbase consumer component, you can define or set a specific range for the end key by providing a string value to the "rangeEndKey" option. This option allows you to specify a range for the data retrieval. However, it''s important to note that providing a value for "rangeEndKey" is not mandatory; if no value is provided, the default behavior will be as if null, meaning no specific end key range will be applied.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel Couchbase component option called "rangeStartKey", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "rangeStartKey" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is designed to define a range for the start key in your data operations. By default, it has no preset value, meaning you can set it according to your specific needs. It''s not mandatory to use this option as its inclusion is optional when working with the Couchbase component within the Camel framework, grouped under the "consumer" category.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and can it be set as a required configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel CouchBase component is designed to control the behavior when the polling consumer does not find any files to process. If this option is enabled (i.e., set to true), it will send an empty message (no body) instead of skipping. By default, this option is set to false. Additionally, it''s important to note that this option can be configured but is not required for use with the CouchBase component in the consumer group settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "skip" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, if it''s not required to be set? (Answer: The purpose of the "skip" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is to define the number of documents to skip when reading from a Couchbase bucket. If not specified, its default value is -1, which essentially means "don''t skip any documents".)'
      answer: |
       'The "skip" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is designed to allow you to specify the number of documents to ignore or skip when reading from a Couchbase bucket. If it''s not set, its default value is -1, which signifies that no documents should be skipped during reading operations.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "viewName" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and is it necessary to specify this option when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "viewName" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is "brewery_beers". While specifying this option is not mandatory, it allows you to customize the view name that will be used during your operations with the Couchbase component, within the consumer group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and when is it possible to use this feature? Also, can you explain what happens when this option is set to its default value (false) and when it''s not used at all (not set or explicitly set to false)?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component allows for bridging errors that occur during message consumption to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means any exceptions thrown while the consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages will be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. However, this feature is only possible if the third-party component (in this case, Couchbase) allows Camel to be notified of an exception being thrown. If the component handles exceptions internally, bridgeErrorHandler cannot be used.              When "bridgeErrorHandler" is set to its default value (false), the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to manage exceptions. These exceptions will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and then ignored. If not used or explicitly set to false, the Camel consumer will follow its standard behavior of logging and ignoring exceptions.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the exceptionHandler option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, how can it be configured to use a custom ExceptionHandler, and what happens by default when this option is not set or the bridgeErrorHandler is enabled?'
      answer: |
       'The `exceptionHandler` option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component allows you to utilize a custom ExceptionHandler. If the `bridgeErrorHandler` is enabled, the `exceptionHandler` will not be in use by default. When this option is not set or `bridgeErrorHandler` is active, exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level will be handled by the consumer, and they will be ignored without raising an exception further along the Camel route. To configure a custom ExceptionHandler, you can assign an object to the `exceptionHandler` option within the Couchbase component''s configuration. This feature is categorized under the advanced group named "consumer."'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and where can this option be found within the configuration options for the component?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is used to set the exchange pattern when a consumer creates an exchange. This option determines how the producer and consumer interact, influencing the flow of messages between them. By default, it does not have a value assigned (defaultValue: null). It falls under the "advanced" group of options within the consumer configuration. If you need to configure this option, you can find it among other Couchbase component settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "pollStrategy" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and can it be configured with a custom implementation for controlling error handling during the poll operation before an Exchange is created and routed in Camel? Also, does it have a default value and is its use considered part of the advanced consumer group?'
      answer: |
       'The "pollStrategy" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component allows you to customize the error handling during the poll operation before an Exchange is created and routed in Camel. It provides a pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy, enabling you to offer your own implementation for controlling errors that may occur during the poll process. By default, this option does not have a preset value, making it configurable according to your specific needs. Its usage is considered part of the advanced consumer group in Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "autoStartIdForInserts" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and can it be set to true or false? Additionally, under what group does this configuration belong when using as a producer?'
      answer: |
       'The "autoStartIdForInserts" option in the Apache Camel CouchBase component is a boolean configuration that determines if an auto-start ID should be assigned during insert operations. By default, it is set to false, meaning no auto-start ID will be assigned unless explicitly specified. You can manually set its value to true or false as per your requirements. This configuration belongs to the "producer" group when used in a producer context.'
    - question: 'What is the default operation for the Apache Camel Couchbase component when using it as a producer, if no specific operation is specified? (Answer: CCB_PUT)'
      answer: |
       'The default operation for the Apache Camel Couchbase component, when used as a producer, is "CCB_PUT" if no specific operation is explicitly defined.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "persistTo" option within the Apache Camel Couchbase component when using it as a producer, and is specifying this option required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s Couchbase component, when used as a producer, the "persistTo" option determines where the data will be persisted. By default, it is set to 0, indicating that the data will not be explicitly persisted. Specifying this option is optional; if not provided, the component uses its default behavior.'
    - question: 'What is the default number of retry attempts for a Couchbase producer in Apache Camel when using the "producerRetryAttempts" option, and can it be configured to a custom value?'
      answer: |
       'The default number of retry attempts for a Couchbase producer in Apache Camel, when utilizing the "producerRetryAttempts" option, is 2. However, this value can be configured to a custom integer if needed, as it''s an optional and configurable parameter within the "producer" group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the Apache Camel Couchbase component option "producerRetryPause", and is it required when using this option? If not set, what is its typical use-case?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel Couchbase component option "producerRetryPause" is an integer with a value of 5000 (milliseconds). This option defines the retry pause between different attempts. It''s important to note that this option is not required, meaning you can opt out of setting it if desired. If not explicitly set, its typical use-case would be for the system to automatically insert a pause before subsequent retries when producing data to Couchbase.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "replicateTo" option within the Apache Camel''s Couchbase component, and what values can be assigned to it when using this option in a producer group?'
      answer: |
       'The "replicateTo" option in Apache Camel''s CouchBase component is designed for specifying where data should be replicated within a CouchBase cluster. This option allows you to control the destination node or group of nodes to which your data will be synchronized. By default, no replication is set (0). However, when using this option in a producer group, it can take an integer value representing the bucket ID or the node UUID of the target node or bucket within the CouchBase cluster.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "startingIdForInsertsFrom" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and what is its default value, type, required status, and which group it belongs to?'
      answer: |
       'The "startingIdForInsertsFrom" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component defines the starting Id where an insert operation is being performed. Its default value is null, meaning no specific starting ID is set initially. It accepts integer values and its required status is false, which implies that it''s optional for using this component. This option belongs to the "producer" group as it pertains to the production of messages within the Camel routing context.'
    - question: 'How does the boolean option "lazyStartProducer" in the Apache Camel Couchbase component impact the startup behavior of a route, and why might it be useful to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" boolean option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component allows you to control the starting behavior of a producer within your route. By setting this option to true, you can configure the producer to start lazily (on the first message). This is useful when a producer may fail during the initial startup, causing the entire route to fail as well.              By deferring the startup of the producer until the first message arrives, you can handle any potential failures during routing via Camel''s error handlers. However, be aware that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take a little time, which could prolong the total processing time of your processing. This option falls under the "producer (advanced)" group, indicating it provides more advanced functionality for managing producers in Camel routes.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "additionalHosts" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "additionalHosts" option within the Apache Camel Couchbase component serves to provide additional Couchbase server hosts. This option accepts a string value, but by default, it has no value assigned (defaultValue: null). It is not a required configuration when using this component; its usage falls under the advanced settings group, meaning that it''s optional and can be used for customizing your connection settings further if needed.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the Apache Camel component Couchbase option named "connectTimeout", and is it marked as a required configuration parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel component Couchbase option named "connectTimeout" is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds), and its data type is duration. This option is marked as optional, meaning it''s not required to set a value if you don''t wish to specify a connect timeout. It belongs to the advanced configuration group.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the optional Apache Camel Couchbase component configuration option named "queryTimeout", and what does it do?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional Apache Camel Couchbase component configuration option named "queryTimeout" is an integer 2500 (or 2.5 seconds) and its data type is duration (representing a time in milliseconds). This option defines the operation timeout for queries, meaning it sets the maximum amount of time a query can take before being timed out. It belongs to the advanced group of configuration options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the `backoffErrorThreshold` option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and is it a required configuration? Additionally, in which group does this option belong within the scheduler settings?'
      answer: |
       'The `backoffErrorThreshold` option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is designed to specify the number of subsequent error polls (failed due to some error) that should occur before the `backoffMultiplier` should be applied. By default, there is no predefined value for this configuration. It''s an optional setting within the scheduler group as it doesn''t have a compulsory requirement in the configuration process.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel Couchbase component option "backoffIdleThreshold" in relation to scheduler groups, and when is it not required?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffIdleThreshold" option within the Apache Camel Couchbase component serves as a count for subsequent idle polls before the "backoffMultipler" should be applied. This setting is relevant to the scheduler groups, helping in controlling the time between polling attempts based on idle periods. However, it''s important to note that this option has no default value and its usage is optional.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel Couchbase component''s "backoffMultiplier" option, when should it be used in conjunction with, and what is its default value and data type?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffMultiplier" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is designed to allow the scheduled polling consumer to pause or back off if a certain number of idles or errors occur consecutively. The multiplier determines the number of skipped polls before the next attempt is made again. When using this option, it''s essential to configure both backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold as well. It''s an optional setting with a default value of null (meaning no predefined value), and its data type is integer. This configuration group falls under "scheduler".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and group belonging to the "delay" option of the Couchbase component in Apache Camel, and is it required for usage?'
      answer: |
       'The "delay" option within the Couchbase component in Apache Camel is an optional parameter that sets the time (in milliseconds) before the next poll. Its default value is 500 milliseconds. It belongs to the "scheduler" group of options, suggesting it pertains to scheduling or timing events. The data type for this option is integer.'
    - question: 'What is the behavior of the "ScheduledPollConsumer" in an Apache Camel route when using the Couchbase component with the "greedy" option enabled, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'In an Apache Camel route utilizing the Couchbase component, if the "greedy" option is enabled, the ScheduledPollConsumer will execute immediately again after a previous run where it polled one or more messages. The "greedy" behavior is used to continuously poll for new messages without waiting for the scheduled interval. Its default value is false, meaning it does not have this continuous polling behavior when disabled.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "initialDelay" option for the Apache Camel Couchbase component when using the scheduler group, and is it necessary to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component when working with the scheduler group is an integer of 1000 milliseconds (or one second). Providing a value for this option is not mandatory, as it specifies the number of milliseconds before the first poll starts, but you can adjust it to suit your specific use case.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the option "repeatCount" in the Apache Camel Couchbase component and what does a non-zero positive integer as its value indicate regarding the frequency of its operation?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel Couchbase component, the default value for the "repeatCount" option is 0. A non-zero positive integer set for this option specifies a maximum limit of the number of times the scheduler will fire the operation. For instance, if you set it to 5, the operation will only be performed five times. It''s important to note that a value of zero or negative means the operation will continue indefinitely without any limit on the number of times it fires.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible usage of the Apache Camel Couchbase component''s "runLoggingLevel" option, which enables configuration of the log level for the start/complete logs when polling, and whether this option is mandatory or optional in using the scheduler?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "runLoggingLevel" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component is TRACE. This option allows you to configure the logging level for start/complete logs when polling. If you want to control the verbosity of these log lines, you can set this option according to your requirements (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR). Note that setting it to TRACE will provide the most detailed logs. The "runLoggingLevel" option is optional in using the scheduler group, meaning you may choose to use it or not based on your logging preferences.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel Couchbase component''s "scheduledExecutorService" option, and is it required or optional when configuring a Camel route?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel Couchbase component''s "scheduledExecutorService" option allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default, each consumer has its own single-threaded thread pool, but this option enables you to use a shared one instead. This is especially useful when dealing with multiple consumers. The default value for this option is null, meaning no predefined executor service will be used if not configured explicitly. Lastly, the use of "scheduledExecutorService" in Couchbase component configuration is optional.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel Couchbase component to use a cron scheduler, either via camel-spring or camel-quartz, and what are the values for built-in schedulers if I want to use them?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel Couchbase component with a cron scheduler, you can utilize either the camel-spring or camel-quartz components. For built-in scheduling, set the value as either "spring" or "quartz". If you don''t require a specific scheduler initially, the default is none. The relevant configuration group for this purpose is the "scheduler" group.'
    - question: 'What are the possible configurations for the option `schedulerProperties` in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and what is its purpose when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz, Spring-based schedulers?'
      answer: |
       'The `schedulerProperties` option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component allows for additional configuration when utilizing a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz, Spring-based schedulers. This object-type property is not required, meaning it can be left empty if no specific configurations are needed. Its purpose is to apply specific properties that help tailor the behavior of these schedulers according to your project''s requirements. For instance, if you''re using a custom scheduler or any of the mentioned Quartz or Spring-based schedulers with the Couchbase component, you can utilize `schedulerProperties` to set up properties like interval times, concurrency limits, and other scheduling parameters as desired.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and whether it''s required for the Apache Camel Couchbase component option "startScheduler", which determines if the scheduler should be automatically started?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel Couchbase component option "startScheduler" is true, meaning that the scheduler will be auto-started. However, it''s not required, as you can set it to false if you wish to manage the scheduler manually.'
    - question: 'What is the default time unit for the options `initialDelay` and `delay` when using the Apache Camel Couchbase component''s scheduler, and what other time units are supported as alternatives to this default value?'
      answer: |
       'The default time unit for the options `initialDelay` and `delay` when utilizing the Apache Camel Couchbase component''s scheduler is MILLISECONDS. However, if you''d like to use a different time unit, alternatives supported include SECONDS, MINUTES, and HOURS as well.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component''s scheduler, and how can it be configured to use fixed rate instead if needed?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component''s scheduler is set to true, meaning that a fixed delay is used between invocations. If you wish to configure it to use a fixed rate instead, you can change its value to false and provide the desired interval in milliseconds under the appropriate group (scheduler). This will cause the component to invoke using a fixed rate rather than a variable delay. For more details on how this works, please refer to the ScheduledExecutorService in JDK for comprehensive understanding.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and whether it''s required for the "password" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, under the category of security features?'

    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "username" option in the Apache Camel Couchbase component, and is it required?'
      answer: |
       'The "username" option within the Apache Camel Couchbase component serves the purpose of specifying a username for authentication when interacting with the Couchbase server. By default, no username value is set ("defaultValue": null), meaning that if you do not provide one, the client will not use any specific username. The usage of this option ("required": false) is optional, allowing flexibility in how you configure your interactions with the Couchbase server. This option falls under the "security" group, highlighting its role in maintaining secure connections to your Couchbase environment.'
