seed_examples:
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the "applicationName" option in using the Apache Camel Google Drive component, and is it required?'
      answer: |
       'The "applicationName" option within the Apache Camel Google Drive component is intended to specify the name of the Google Drive application. For example, its value could be ''camel-google-drive/1.0''. However, it''s not a required parameter, as indicated by the "required": false in its definition. Consequently, the default value for this option is null.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and optional nature (as it has a default value of null), data type, and group association of the "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component called "google-drive"?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component named "google-drive", the "clientId" option serves as the Client ID of your Google Drive application. It is an optional field, meaning it can be left empty if not provided with a default value of null. The data type for this option is a string, and it falls under the common group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the configuration format for using a shared configuration when working with the Apache Camel Google Drive component? Is there a default value or is it optional (required: false) in the given information?'
      answer: |
       'The configuration format for using a shared configuration when working with the Apache Camel Google Drive component is an object type, where the property "component" has the value "google-drive". This option, denoted as "configuration", allows you to use a shared configuration, and it''s not mandatory to provide it since the "required" property is set to false in the given information. There is no default value specified for this configuration option.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Drive when using a wide-domain service account? Furthermore, is this option required?'
      answer: |
       'The "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Drive, when used with a wide-domain service account, serves to grant delegated permissions to individual users or service accounts. This means that the specified user or service account can access Google Drive resources on behalf of the wide-domain service account. However, it''s important to note that the "delegate" option is not required, as you can still use the wide-domain service account directly. The default value for this option is null, meaning no delegate is set by default.'
    - question: 'Question: What are the optional scopes that can be specified when using the Apache Camel Google Drive component to set the level of permissions for a user account, and where can I find more detailed information about these scopes?'
      answer: |
       'When using the Apache Camel Google Drive component, you have the option to specify the scope of permissions that a drive application will have on a user account. This allows you to control the level of access that the application has. The available scopes can be found in more detail at this link: https://developers.google.com/drive/web/scopes. Keep in mind that specifying these scopes is optional when working with the component, and their use may not be required for every application or integration scenario.'
    - question: 'How does the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel Google Drive component work, and when is it beneficial to set its value to true instead of using the default ExceptionHandler?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel Google Drive component facilitates linking the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions (if supported by the third-party component) that occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to retrieve incoming messages will now be processed as a message and managed by the routing Error Handler.              Setting the value of "bridgeErrorHandler" to true can be advantageous when you want more control over how exceptions are handled, rather than relying on the default Apache Camel ExceptionHandler that logs exceptions at WARN or ERROR level and discards them. By making use of the routing Error Handler, you have the ability to further process or handle these exceptions in a manner suitable to your application''s needs. Keep in mind that this functionality is only possible if the third-party component permits Camel to be informed when an exception was thrown; some components manage exceptions internally and do not support "bridgeErrorHandler".'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Google Drive component affect the startup behavior of the producer, and what potential impact might this have on the overall processing time of messages?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in Apache Camel''s Google Drive component allows for a more flexible startup behavior of the producer. When set to true, the producer will not be started immediately during the CamelContext or route initialization. Instead, it will start on the first message processed. This can be beneficial in scenarios where starting the producer might cause an error during the startup, preventing the route from being initialized successfully.              However, since the producer starts only when a message is processed, there could be a slight delay the first time a message is processed due to the creation and starting of the producer. This additional time taken may impact the overall processing time of messages in your system. Therefore, it''s essential to consider this potential trade-off between startup flexibility and initial processing speed when deciding whether to use this option.'
    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component Google Drive impact the automatic configuration of various services such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc.? And what is the default value of this option and can it be omitted if not needed?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component Google Drive allows for automatic configuration of various services such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. This is achieved by enabling autowiring, a feature that looks up in the registry to find a single instance of matching type and configures it on the component. If you disable this option, you would need to manually configure these services. The default value of this option is true, meaning autowiring is enabled by default. However, if autowiring is not required for your use case, you can omit this option as it has a "required": false property in the configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientFactory" option in the Apache Camel''s "google-drive" component, and can it be omitted if a custom factory is not provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientFactory" option in Apache Camel''s "google-drive" component serves as an optional configuration for creating the Google Calendar client. By default, it uses the BatchGoogleDriveClientFactory. If you wish to provide a custom factory, you can do so; however, if no custom factory is provided, the default factory will be used, making it possible to omit this option in such cases.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel component "google-drive", and is it recommended for long-term use due to its expiration period?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel component "google-drive" is an OAuth 2 access token used to authenticate and interact with Google Drive. However, it''s important to note that this token typically expires after an hour, making it less suitable for long-term usage. For prolonged interaction, it''s recommended to use the "refreshToken" instead, which can extend the lifespan of your authentication. This information falls under the security group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Drive, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Drive serves as the secret key of your drive application. It''s a string value that, when provided, enhances the security of your application by allowing it to access your Google Drive data. However, it does not come with a default value and its usage is optional, meaning you can choose whether or not to include it in your configuration depending on your specific use case and security requirements.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel Google Drive component to use an OAuth 2 refresh token for obtaining a new access token when the current one expires, and is it mandatory to provide this refresh token during configuration?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel Google Drive component to utilize an OAuth 2 refresh token for acquiring a new access token upon expiration of the current one, you can set the "refreshToken" option during configuration. Although providing this refresh token is not mandatory, it is essential if your application is long-lived, as it ensures uninterrupted access to Google Calendar services. If you wish to use a refresh token, simply include it in the component''s configuration as a string value under the "refreshToken" option.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and format of the "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel Google Drive component, and is it required or optional? Also, how should a base64 encoded service account key be provided if it''s being used?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceAccountKey" option within the Apache Camel Google Drive component serves to authenticate your application as a service account using a JSON format service account key. Although this field is optional, it can be provided when needed, primarily for security purposes. If you have a base64 encoded service account key, you should prefix it with "base64:" before inputting it into the component. For instance, if your base64 encoded key is ''abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'', you would enter it as ''base64:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz''.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel component "google-drive"? Is it mandatory to provide a value for this option? If not, what are possible values or examples for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "applicationName" option within the Apache Camel Google Drive component is intended to specify the name of the Google Drive application. For example, a valid value could be "camel-google-drive/1.0". However, it''s important to note that this value is optional, as indicated by the "required: false" in its definition. If not provided, it can remain null. The choice of value for this option reflects the specific Google Drive application being integrated into your project.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of using the "GoogleCalendarClientFactory" in the Apache Camel component "google-drive" option named "clientFactory", and does it have a default value?'
      answer: |
       'The GoogleCalendarClientFactory is an optional configuration in the Apache Camel google-drive component, specifically for the option named "clientFactory". Its purpose is to serve as a factory for creating clients within the Google Drive system. By default, this will utilize the BatchGoogleDriveClientFactory for client creation. However, it does not have a default value; you can choose to specify a different factory if needed.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "Client ID" option in the Apache Camel Google Drive component, and is it required?'
      answer: |
       'The "Client ID" option in the Apache Camel Google Drive component is a string type that provides the Client ID of the drive application. Its purpose is to identify your application when requesting access to Google Drive resources. However, it''s not a required field, meaning you can choose whether to provide it or not. By default, no Client ID value is set in the configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel Google Drive component when using a wide-domain service account, and is its use optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "delegate" option in the Apache Camel Google Drive component, when used with a wide-domain service account, serves to delegate access to the Google Drive service. This option is not mandatory as it has a default value of null. If provided, it specifies a user email address that will be used to impersonate for the requested operation, allowing you to control which user''s permissions are utilized when interacting with Google Drive.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "inBody" option for the Apache Camel Google Drive component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "inBody" option for the Apache Camel Google Drive component serves to set a parameter name that will be passed in the exchange In Body. This option has no default value (defaultValue: null). However, providing a value for this option is not mandatory as it''s marked as optional (required: false). It falls under the common group of options.'
    - question: 'What are the possible scopes that can be specified when using the Google Drive component in Apache Camel, and what is the default value or whether it''s required?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the Google Drive component within Apache Camel, the possible scopes that can be specified specify the level of permissions you want a drive application to have to a user account. These scopes are detailed at https://developers.google.com/drive/web/scopes. The default value for scopes is null, meaning no specific scope is set by default. Whether it''s required to set scopes depends on your use case and the level of access you need for your Google Drive integration; however, setting scopes is not a mandatory requirement in all cases as it can be left optional.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel Google Drive component, and is it necessary for its configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel Google Drive component allows you to control whether an empty message (no body) should be sent when the polling consumer does not find any files to process. Its default value is false, meaning that no message is sent if no files are found. However, it''s not necessary for its configuration as it can be left unchanged if the behavior of sending a message only when there are files to process is desired.'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel "google-drive" component''s bridgeErrorHandler option handle exceptions thrown by the Google Drive API during message pickup, and how can we configure it to use the routing Error Handler for such cases?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel "google-drive" component''s `bridgeErrorHandler` option is designed to manage exceptions that occur during message pickup from the Google Drive API. By setting `bridgeErrorHandler` to true, you can configure it so that any exceptions encountered will be treated as messages and processed by the routing Error Handler.              However, it''s important to note that this feature is only available if the Google Drive API allows Camel to be notified when an exception occurs. In cases where the 3rd party component (in this instance, Google Drive) handles exceptions internally, `bridgeErrorHandler` may not be possible.              In situations where the API doesn''t support this functionality, we may enhance the Camel component in future releases to seamlessly integrate with the Google Drive API and make this feature available. By default, when `bridgeErrorHandler` is not enabled, the consumer will use the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler`, which logs exceptions at WARN or ERROR level and ignores them.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom ExceptionHandler for the Apache Camel Google Drive component using the exceptionHandler option, and what happens when this option is not used?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom ExceptionHandler for the Apache Camel Google Drive component, you can utilize the "exceptionHandler" option. When this option is set, it allows you to use your own ExceptionHandler instead of the default one provided by Camel. However, if the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled, then the "exceptionHandler" is not in effect as it takes precedence. By default, when the "exceptionHandler" option is not used, Camel will handle exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. This behavior can be modified by providing a custom ExceptionHandler to suit your specific needs within the "consumer (advanced)" group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior for setting the exchange pattern in the Apache Camel Google Drive component when consuming data, and is it mandatory to set this option? Additionally, where can we find information about this advanced feature related to consumer settings in the Google Drive component documentation?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for setting the exchange pattern in the Apache Camel Google Drive component when consuming data is not specified (as indicated by the `defaultValue: null`). It''s optional to set this option, meaning you can choose to define it or let it take its default value. To find more information about this advanced feature related to consumer settings in the Google Drive component documentation, you can look under the "consumer (advanced)" group within the Google Drive component section of Apache Camel''s official documentation.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel Google Drive component, and how can a custom implementation be provided for this option to control error handling during the poll operation before an Exchange has been created and routed in Camel?'
      answer: |
       'The `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel Google Drive component is designed to allow you to provide your custom implementation for controlling error handling that may occur during the poll operation, before an Exchange has been created and routed within Camel. This means that if any issues arise during the process of fetching files from Google Drive, you can specify a custom strategy to manage these errors according to your application''s requirements. To provide a custom implementation for this option, you simply need to implement the `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy` and configure it in your route accordingly.'
    - question: 'Given the information provided, here''s a question related to the Apache Camel component "google-drive" and its option "lazyStartProducer":              When using the google-drive component in an Apache Camel route, what is the purpose of setting the "lazyStartProducer" option to true, and why might it be beneficial or potentially detrimental to performance?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "lazyStartProducer" option to true for the Google Drive component in an Apache Camel route allows you to defer the initial startup of the producer. This can be useful when the production may otherwise fail during the start-up phase, preventing the entire route from being started successfully.              By starting the producer lazily, you enable the route to handle any potential failures during message processing via Camel''s routing error handlers. However, it''s important to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer might take a little extra time, which could prolong the overall processing time of the route.              In summary, setting "lazyStartProducer" to true can help manage failures during start-up and provide more flexibility in handling errors, but it may impact performance due to the added time required for producer creation during message processing.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel''s Google Drive component (google-drive), and is it required when using this component with the scheduler group?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffErrorThreshold" option in Apache Camel''s Google Drive component (google-drive) determines the number of subsequent error polls that should occur before the "backoffMultipler" kicks in. Its default value is null, meaning it doesn''t have a predefined value and can be set manually. However, using this option is not required when working with the scheduler group as it primarily deals with handling retry strategies during errors in asynchronous processing.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Google Drive component, and is it a required configuration option? Additionally, where does this option belong within the configurable groups for the scheduler settings?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Google Drive component is an integer value that specifies the number of consecutive idle polls that should occur before the "backoffMultiplier" should take effect. Its default value is null, meaning it doesn''t have a predefined value and can be set as needed. This option is not required for configuration, so its inclusion is optional. Within the configurable groups for the scheduler settings, this option falls under the "scheduler" group, indicating that it pertains to the scheduling and timing of polling tasks in relation to Google Drive operations.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `backoffMultiplier` option in the Apache Camel Google Drive component affect the scheduled polling consumer, and under what circumstances is it necessary to configure this option along with `backoffIdleThreshold` and/or `backoffErrorThreshold`? Also, what is the default value for the `backoffMultiplier` option, and can it be considered a required configuration parameter?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `backoffMultiplier` option in the Apache Camel Google Drive component controls how long the scheduled polling consumer will wait before retrying if there has been a series of idles or errors. The number specified as the `backoffMultiplier` determines the number of skipped polls, with the next attempt being made again after that many skips.              In situations where the polling consumer frequently encounters idle periods or errors, it may be necessary to configure this option along with `backoffIdleThreshold` and/or `backoffErrorThreshold`. These options define the conditions under which the backoff mechanism will be triggered and help manage the overall behavior of the scheduled polling process.              The default value for the `backoffMultiplier` option is null, meaning that no automatic backoff is applied when using this component. However, it should be noted that this option is not a required configuration parameter and can be set as desired based on specific use cases and error handling requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the default millisecond delay before the next poll when using the "delay" option for the Apache Camel Google Drive component within a scheduler group, and is it required to be set?'
      answer: |
       'The default millisecond delay before the next poll when utilizing the "delay" option for the Apache Camel Google Drive component within a scheduler group is 500 milliseconds. It''s important to note that setting this value is not mandatory as the "required" attribute indicates it''s optional.'
    - question: 'What is the behavior of the Apache Camel''s "greedy" option in the context of the Google Drive component when it is enabled?'
      answer: |
       'When the "greedy" option is enabled in the Apache Camel''s Google Drive component, it means that if the ScheduledPollConsumer runs and fetches one or more messages during its previous execution, it will immediately run again instead of waiting for the scheduled interval. This behavior can be useful when dealing with real-time data processing where you want to ensure that all new messages are processed as quickly as possible. However, it''s important to note that this option is not required and its default value is false.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel component "google-drive", and can this option be marked as required or is it optional?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel component "google-drive" is an integer type with a value of 1000 milliseconds. This option is optional, meaning that it can be provided or skipped during configuration. It determines the delay (in milliseconds) before the first poll starts within the "scheduler" groups of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible usage scenarios for the "repeatCount" option in the Apache Camel "google-drive" component, and why might a user choose to set a non-zero integer value for it?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel "google-drive" component, the "repeatCount" option is an integer property that specifies a maximum limit for the number of times a scheduled task can run. By default, this value is set to 0, which means the task will run indefinitely until manually stopped. However, if you set it to a non-zero integer value (e.g., 1, 5, or any other positive integer), the scheduler will only fire that specific number of times. This could be useful in scenarios where you want to perform a specific action a limited number of times on Google Drive, such as copying files or syncing data, and then stop the process without requiring manual intervention.'
    - question: 'What is the default logging level for the "start/complete" logs in the Apache Camel "google-drive" component when using the "runLoggingLevel" option, and which logging levels are considered valid options to configure this setting?'
      answer: |
       'The default logging level for the "start/complete" logs in the Apache Camel "google-drive" component, when working with the "runLoggingLevel" option, is set to TRACE. Valid options to configure this setting include TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the custom or shared thread pool for the Camel Google Drive consumer using the scheduledExecutorService option in the Apache Camel Google Drive component? Is it necessary to provide a default value, and are there specific groups of options this setting belongs to?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom or shared thread pool for the Camel Google Drive consumer using the `scheduledExecutorService` option, you can do so by setting this property within your Camel route configuration. This option allows you to specify a custom ExecutorService to be used for the consumer, which can help in managing concurrency when consuming from multiple sources. By default, each consumer has its own single-threaded thread pool, but providing a custom ExecutorService lets you control the number of threads and their behavior.              It is not necessary to provide a default value for `scheduledExecutorService`, as it''s an optional setting. However, if you choose to set one, make sure it conforms to the required format for an ExecutorService configuration.              This setting belongs to the "scheduler" group of options in your Camel component configuration. This group contains various settings related to scheduling and thread management within the component.'
    - question: 'What is the recommended way to set up a scheduling mechanism using the Apache Camel Google Drive component, specifically when utilizing the "scheduler" option, and are there any default values or requirements for this setup?'
      answer: |
       'To set up a scheduling mechanism using the Apache Camel Google Drive component with the "scheduler" option, you can choose either the camel-spring or camel-quartz components. These built-in schedulers are provided for convenience. There is no default value specified for this setup. The relevant group for this configuration is "scheduler".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the `schedulerProperties` option in the Apache Camel component `google-drive`, and are these properties required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The `schedulerProperties` option in the Apache Camel component `google-drive` is designed to configure additional properties when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz, Spring-based schedulers. This option is optional as indicated by `required: false`. By default, it doesn''t have a value (`defaultValue: null`). These properties are not required but can be specified for customizing the scheduling behavior in your Google Drive operations with Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and required status for automatically starting the scheduler in Apache Camel''s google-drive component when using the startScheduler option? Also, can this option be configured if not required?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for automatically starting the scheduler in Apache Camel''s google-drive component is set to true when using the startScheduler option. However, it is an optional setting, meaning you don''t necessarily need to configure it as it has a default value. If you wish to customize this behavior, you can do so.'
    - question: 'What is the default value of the time unit option (timeUnit) in the Apache Camel component "google-drive" for both initialDelay and delay options when it is not explicitly set? Is it possible to use a different time unit if desired, and if so, what are the groups or categories under which this configuration can be found?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the time unit option (timeUnit) in the Apache Camel component "google-drive" for both initialDelay and delay options is MILLISECONDS when it is not explicitly set. Yes, it''s possible to use a different time unit if desired. The available time units can be found under the "scheduler" groups in your configuration settings. You can modify the timeUnit to seconds (SECONDS), minutes (MINUTES) or hours (HOURS) as per your requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel Google Drive component, and what does it mean when this option is set to false? (Hint: Consider the details provided about ScheduledExecutorService in JDK.)'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel Google Drive component is true, meaning a fixed delay is applied between tasks. When you set this option to false, it switches to using the fixed rate mode as described in the ScheduledExecutorService of Java''s JDK (Java Development Kit). In fixed rate mode, tasks are executed with a given period between them, and if the task takes longer than the period, the remaining time until the next scheduled execution is compensated at the end of the current task. This difference in behavior allows you to customize the scheduling of Google Drive operations based on your specific use case requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of using the "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel component "google-drive", and why is it recommended to use the "refreshToken" instead for long-term usage?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel component "google-drive" is an OAuth 2 access token that provides authentication when interacting with Google Drive. However, due to its expiration after approximately one hour, it''s advisable to utilize the "refreshToken" instead for long-term usage. The refresh token allows you to obtain a new access token without user intervention once it expires. This ensures continuous and uninterrupted access to Google Drive resources in your Apache Camel applications.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) for the "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component "google-drive", and is it required to be set?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientSecret" option within the Apache Camel component "google-drive" serves as the secret key of your Google Drive application. It''s used for authentication purposes. By default, this value is not provided (defaultValue: null). Its inclusion in the configuration is optional, meaning it''s not required to set it, but doing so can help secure communication between your application and Google Drive. This option falls under the "security" group of settings.'
    - question: 'How does one configure the refreshToken option in the Apache Camel Google Drive component to ensure that the application can obtain a new accessToken when the current one expires, especially for long-lived applications?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the refreshToken option in the Apache Camel Google Drive component for obtaining a new accessToken when the current one expires, especially for long-lived applications, you can follow these steps:              1. In your Camel route, ensure that you have included the Google Drive component and configured it with the necessary details such as clientId, clientSecret, and refreshToken.              2. Set the "refreshToken" property to the OAuth 2 refresh token provided during the initial authorization process. The default value for this property is null, so make sure to assign a non-null string value.              Here''s an example configuration snippet:              ```java       GoogleDriveComponent googleDrive = new GoogleDriveComponent();       googleDrive.setClientId("your_client_id");       googleDrive.setClientSecret("your_client_secret");       // Set refreshToken to the OAuth 2 refresh token       googleDrive.setRefreshToken("your_refresh_token");              from("direct:start")           .to("google-drive://your_scope?clientId=#{googleDrive.getClientId()}&clientSecret=#{googleDrive.getClientSecret()}&refreshToken=#{googleDrive.getRefreshToken()}");       ```              3. With this configuration, the Google Calendar component will use the provided refresh token to obtain a new accessToken whenever the current one expires. This ensures that your long-lived application can continue to authenticate and interact with Google Drive smoothly.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "serviceAccountKey" option in Apache Camel''s Google Drive component and how should it be formatted for correct authentication when using as a service account, specifying if it can be left empty and if it requires base64 encoding?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceAccountKey" option in Apache Camel''s Google Drive component is used to provide a service account key in JSON format, which enables authentication of an application as a service account with Google Drive. This key should be formatted in Base64, prefixed with "base64:". It is not mandatory to use this option, as it has a default value of null and can be left empty if you prefer other means of authentication or are using a different type of account. However, if you do choose to use a service account, providing the correct Base64-encoded service account key is essential for authenticating your application with Google Drive.'
