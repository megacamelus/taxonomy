seed_examples:
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "kubernetesClient" option within the Apache Camel "openshift-builds" component, and is it required to be set by default?'
      answer: |
       'The "kubernetesClient" option within the Apache Camel "openshift-builds" component is intended for using an existing Kubernetes client. However, it''s not required by default. You can choose to provide a kubernetes client object if you wish to integrate with your Kubernetes cluster directly from your OpenShift builds.'
    - question: 'How does the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel OpenShift Builds component affect the behavior of a producer, and why might it be useful to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel OpenShift Builds component allows you to configure whether the associated producer should be started lazily (on the first message). This setting can be beneficial when a producer may fail during the initial startup, causing the entire route to fail. By delaying the startup of the producer until the first message is processed, you can handle any initial failures through Camel''s routing error handlers.              However, it''s important to note that enabling this option may result in a slight increase in total processing time as creating and starting the producer upon the first message processed could take some additional time. This trade-off allows for more resilient and flexible integration scenarios where producers require extensive resources or have complex initialization steps.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel OpenShiftBuilds component, and can it be configured if not set (i.e., its required status)?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel OpenShiftBuilds component is a boolean property that determines whether autowiring is enabled. When set to true by default, it enables automatic configuration of components like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc., by looking up in the registry for a single instance of matching type. If not explicitly specified during setup, this option can be left unconfigured as it''s marked as optional within the "advanced" group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "apiVersion" option in the Apache Camel openshift-builds component, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "apiVersion" option in the Apache Camel OpenShift builds component does not have a default value and is used to specify the Kubernetes API Version to use. It''s an optional parameter within the producer group. Therefore, you can choose to include it when using this component or omit it if you prefer the latest version.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "dnsDomain" option in the Apache Camel "openshift-builds" component, and is it a required or optional configuration parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The "dnsDomain" option in the Apache Camel "openshift-builds" component is an optional configuration parameter used for ServiceCall External IP (EIP) when resolving DNS. It has no default value. This means you''ll need to provide a custom string value if you want to set it, otherwise, it will not be assigned automatically. The group this option belongs to is "producer".'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "kubernetesClient" option in the Apache Camel openshift-builds component, and is it required or optional to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "kubernetesClient" option in the Apache Camel "openshift-builds" component is not provided (defaultValue: null). This option is considered as an optional configuration, meaning you are not required to provide a value for it.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and optional nature of the "namespace" option when using the Apache Camel "openshift-builds" component in a producer context, and what type of value can be provided for it?'
      answer: |
       'The "namespace" option, when used with the Apache Camel "openshift-builds" component within a producer context, is an optional setting that allows you to specify the Kubernetes namespace where your OpenShift builds are located. Although it''s not required, providing a value for this option can help manage resources more effectively in multi-namespace environments. The expected data type for the "namespace" value is a string.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and optional nature of the "operation" parameter in the Apache Camel component "openshift-builds" when used as a producer, specifically in terms of its functionality within Kubernetes?'
      answer: |
       'The "operation" parameter in the Apache Camel component "openshift-builds", when acting as a producer, is an optional string attribute that specifies the operation to be performed on a Kubernetes cluster. Its purpose is to provide flexibility in terms of the actions that can be executed within the Kubernetes environment, such as creating, updating, or deleting resources. The functionality of this parameter lies in its ability to instruct the component on how to interact with the Kubernetes API to carry out the desired operation.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the "portName" option in the Apache Camel "openshift-builds" component when it is not required, and which group it belongs to in terms of Camel producers?'
      answer: |
       'The "portName" option in the Apache Camel "openshift-builds" component serves as a port name for ServiceCall Externalized Internet Protocol (EIP). Although it does not have a default value, you can provide a custom string if needed. When this option is not required, it can be left null. The "portName" option belongs to the "producer" group in terms of Camel components, indicating it''s related to producing messages or data streams in your integration flows.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the optional "portProtocol" option in the Apache Camel component "openshift-builds", and can it be left empty if not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional "portProtocol" in the Apache Camel component "openshift-builds" is tcp, and it is a string type. If you do not specify this option, it can be left empty or omitted entirely as its usage is not required.'
    - question: 'How does the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component "openshift-builds" affect the behavior of a Camel route, and why might it be beneficial to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component "openshift-builds" allows you to defer the startup of a producer until the first message is processed. This can be advantageous when a producer may otherwise fail during the initial startup, causing the entire route to fail as well. By setting this option to true, you enable the route to start successfully and handle any subsequent production failure using Camel''s routing error handlers. However, it''s important to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time, which could prolong the overall processing time of the route. This option can be particularly useful in situations where you want to ensure a smoother startup for your Camel routes, especially when dealing with components that might have complex initialization requirements or are subject to transient errors during startup.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the connectionTimeout option in the Apache Camel openshift-builds component, and is it required or optional? Also, could you please explain where this option is used and its significance in making requests to the Kubernetes API server?'
      answer: |
       'The "connectionTimeout" option within the Apache Camel OpenShift builds component is an integer type, with a default value of null. It''s an optional parameter, found under the advanced group. This option sets the connection timeout in milliseconds to use when making requests to the Kubernetes API server. Essentially, it specifies the maximum time that the client will wait for the server to respond before giving up and considering the request failed. This helps prevent your application from hanging indefinitely if the server is slow or unresponsive.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and optional nature of the ''caCertData'' option in the Apache Camel component ''openshift-builds'', and what type of data should be provided if specified?'
      answer: |
       'The ''caCertData'' option within the Apache Camel component ''openshift-builds'' is an optional parameter under the security group, describing The CA Cert Data. If you choose to specify this option, it should be provided as a string containing the required certificate authority (CA) data for secure communication in your OpenShift builds process. However, if not specified, no default value will be assigned to it.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and optional nature of the "caCertFile" option in the Apache Camel component "openshift-builds", and how can you provide a value for this option when using it?'
      answer: |
       'The "caCertFile" option in the Apache Camel component "openshift-builds" serves the purpose of providing a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate file for security purposes. This option is optional, meaning you can use the OpenShift Builds component without specifying it if your setup does not require CA verification. To provide a value for this option when using it, you would set the path to your CA cert file as a string. For example:              ```       openshift-builds:caCertFile=/path/to/your/cacert.pem       ```'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "Client Cert Data" option in the Apache Camel component "openshift-builds", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
