    - question: 'Is it necessary for the third-party component to allow Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown in order to use the Apache Camel Undertow option named bridgeErrorHandler? If so, can you provide examples of such components that do and do not support this functionality?'
      answer: |
       'Yes, it is necessary for the third-party component to allow Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown in order to use the Apache Camel Undertow option named `bridgeErrorHandler`. Some examples of components that do support this functionality are those which provide a mechanism to notify Camel of exceptions (such as ActiveMQ or HornetQ for messaging, CXF or RestEasy for REST APIs), while components like plain FTP, SMTP or simple HTTP may not support this functionality because they handle exceptions internally only. For future releases, it''s possible that Camel will improve some components to hook into the third-party component and make the `bridgeErrorHandler` possible with those components as well.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel `muteException` option within the `undertow` component, and what is its default value and whether it is a required option?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel `muteException` option in the `undertow` component is designed to suppress the exception''s stack trace from appearing in the response''s body when an exchange fails while processing on the consumer side. This option helps maintain cleaner responses by not disclosing sensitive or unnecessary technical details, particularly when dealing with clients. The default value for this option is `false`, and it is an optional feature that can be grouped under the `consumer`.'
    - question: 'Here''s a possible question for this information:              "In an Apache Camel application using Undertow component, when should the producer be started lazily, and what are the benefits and drawbacks of this option (lazyStartProducer)?"'
      answer: |
       'In an Apache Camel application using the Undertow component, you can start the producer lazily by setting the "lazyStartProducer" option to true. This is beneficial when a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy, you can handle the failure during routing messages using Camel''s routing error handlers.              The main drawback of starting a producer lazily is that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the message processing. However, by doing this you ensure a more reliable start-up of your routes, especially in situations where initializing the producer could potentially cause issues during application startup.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the Apache Camel "autowiredEnabled" option in the Undertow component, and can this feature be disabled?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Undertow component is true. This option determines whether autowiring is enabled for automatic autowiring of options, specifically marked as autowired. When autowiring is enabled, the component looks up in the registry to find a single instance of matching type, and then configures it on the component. This can be used for automatic configuration of JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. If you wish to disable this feature, it can be done by setting "autowiredEnabled" to false in your component configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `hostOptions` option in the Apache Camel Undertow component and can you explain what kind of values it can take when configured? Additionally, do you know if this configuration is optional and if a default value is provided for it?'
      answer: |
       'The `hostOptions` option in the Apache Camel Undertow component is used to configure common options, such as thread pools, on the Undertow server host. This configuration is particularly useful when you want to fine-tune your server''s performance by setting parameters like the number of worker threads or socket buffers. When you choose to set `hostOptions`, it can take an object with various key-value pairs depending on the specific Undertow configuration options you wish to adjust. It''s important to note that the `hostOptions` configuration is considered optional and has no default value provided, making it a part of advanced settings for Camel users.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the Apache Camel Undertow component option `undertowHttpBinding`, and can it be used without any default value? If so, how can custom HttpBindings be configured in this setting?'
      answer: |
       'The `undertowHttpBinding` option under the Apache Camel Undertow component is designed for configuring a custom HttpBinding to manage the correlation between Camel messages and HttpClient more precisely. This allows for fine-grained control over how HTTP messages are exchanged during communication.              When using this option, you don''t necessarily need to provide a default value, as it has been marked as an optional setting (`required:false`). To configure custom HttpBindings in this scenario, you can define an appropriate HttpBinding object according to your needs within the Camel context or route configuration.              By doing so, you gain the flexibility to adapt the mapping between HTTP requests and Camel messages to better suit your application''s requirements or integrate with specific external APIs or services that may have unique needs.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the `allowedRoles` option in the Apache Camel Undertow component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option? (Answer: The `allowedRoles` option configures a comma-separated list of allowed roles used by `UndertowSecurityProvider`, with a default value of null, and it''s not mandatory to provide a value.)'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s Undertow component, the "allowedRoles" option is employed for configuration by the `UndertowSecurityProvider`. It represents a comma-separated list of authorized roles. By default, this option has no set value (`defaultValue`: null). It should be noted that providing a value for the `allowedRoles` option is not mandatory.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the Apache Camel `undertow` component''s `securityConfiguration` option when working with the `UndertowSecurityProvider`, and what is its default value or any required group it belongs to?'
      answer: |
       'The `undertow` component''s `securityConfiguration` option in Apache Camel is utilized to configure security settings specifically for the `UndertowSecurityProvider`. This configuration object is designed to be used from the UndertowSecurityProvider. Each provider has the discretion to accept this configuration or not. By providing a security configuration, you can customize security aspects for your application when using Undertow.              It''s essential to note that this option does not have a default value, meaning you must provide a custom configuration if you wish to use it. Furthermore, this configuration is part of the `security` group in Camel. This implies that it pertains to the security-related options and settings within your application.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior for the securityProvider option in the Apache Camel Undertow component and how can it be configured for use with a specific security provider, either directly or by using the Service Provider Interface (SPI) approach?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the `securityProvider` option in the Apache Camel Undertow component is null, meaning no specific security provider is set by default. To configure it with a custom security provider, you can directly assign an instance of your chosen security provider to this option. Alternatively, you can leverage the Service Provider Interface (SPI) approach for greater flexibility. In this case, you would not need to explicitly specify the security provider in the configuration; instead, the Undertow component will discover and use the available security providers by scanning for them at runtime. To ensure correct discovery of your custom security provider, place it appropriately within the service provider package hierarchy defined in the SPI.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the Apache Camel Undertow component to utilize SSL encryption (security) using the SSLContextParameters option, and is it necessary or optional?'
      answer: |
       'To configure Apache Camel Undertow component to use SSL encryption for security, you can set the `sslContextParameters` option. This option allows you to provide an `SSLContextParameters` object that will be used by Undertow''s SSL handling. The usage of SSLContextParameters is optional; however, it is recommended if you want to establish a secure communication channel with your server, as it provides an additional layer of protection against data interception and tampering. When providing an `SSLContextParameters` object, you should specify the keyStore and trustStore properties at the very least. Here''s a Camel route example demonstrating how to use SSLContextParameters for secure communication with Undertow:              ```java       from("undertow://localhost/secure-route")           .to("ssl://localhost:8443?sslContextParameters={keyStorePath=''path/to/keystore'', keyStorePassword=''secret''}");       ```       In this example, replace `''path/to/keystore''` and `''secret''` with the path to your keystore file and the password required to access it, respectively.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "useGlobalSslContextParameters" option within the Apache Camel Undertow component, and can it be set as a mandatory configuration option in a Camel route? (Note: The default value for this option is false and it can be set as an optional configuration parameter.)'
      answer: |
       'The "useGlobalSslContextParameters" option within the Apache Camel Undertow component allows for the enabling of global SSL context parameters. If set to true, it will use shared SSL context parameters across all connections rather than creating individual ones. By default, this option is false. It can be configured as an optional parameter in a Camel route, meaning it''s not strictly required for the operation of the component but can be used to influence its behavior, specifically for security-related purposes.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the "useStreaming" option in the Apache Camel undertow component for both HTTP and WebSocket endpoints, and when would it be beneficial to set it to true instead of its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "useStreaming" option in the Apache Camel Undertow component for both HTTP and WebSocket endpoints is false. In this state, text and binary messages are passed directly as bytes or strings for HTTP and WebSocket respectively. If set to true, these messages will be wrapped as Java input streams (InputStream/Reader) before they''re passed to an Exchange.              Setting "useStreaming" to true can be beneficial in scenarios where you''re dealing with large message payloads and need efficient handling of those data streams. This is due to the fact that wrapping the messages as InputStream enables Camel to handle these large payloads more effectively by allowing for chunked transfer encoding, thus reducing memory consumption and potentially improving overall performance. However, if memory usage isn''t a significant concern or optimization isn''t necessary, keeping it at its default value should work well enough in most cases.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and required status of the "accessLog" option in the Apache Camel Undertow component''s consumer settings, and can this option be considered necessary to configure when using the component?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessLog" option in the Apache Camel Undertow component''s consumer settings is a boolean type with a default value of false, meaning that the consumer does not write access log by default. It is optional, as indicated by its required status being false, which means it can be configured or left unconfigured according to your specific use case. Therefore, while it can be useful for tracking request/response data, it''s not necessary to configure this option when using the Undertow component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''httpMethodRestrict'' option within the Apache Camel''s Undertow component and what type of value should it take if specified? Furthermore, can this option be configured as optional and if yes, what would be its default value if not explicitly provided?'
      answer: |
       'The ''httpMethodRestrict'' option within Apache Camel''s Undertow component is used to restrict access to an endpoint based on the HTTP method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.). It allows you to control which types of HTTP requests can consume your service. Multiple methods can be specified by separating them with commas. The value for this option should be a string representing the HTTP methods. This option can be configured as optional, and if not explicitly provided, its default value is null.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `matchOnUriPrefix` option in the Apache Camel Undertow component affect the behavior of finding a target consumer when an exact match cannot be found? Is it necessary to set this value, and if so, what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `matchOnUriPrefix` option in the Apache Camel Undertow component influences the behavior of discovering a target consumer when an exact URI match isn''t found. If you set it to true, the consumer will attempt to find a matching consumer by considering the URI prefix instead of requiring an exact match. However, it is not necessary to set this value as its default is false. When left unspecified or with its default value, Camel won''t use URI prefix matching to locate a consumer when an exact match isn''t found. This option belongs to the ''consumer'' group of options in the Undertow component configuration.'
    - question: 'In Apache Camel''s Undertow component, what is the purpose and default value of the "muteException" option in the context of the consumer side processing?'
      answer: |
       'The "muteException" option in Apache Camel''s Undertow component, when enabled on the consumer side, ensures that if an Exchange fails during processing, the response body will not contain the exception''s stack trace. By default, this option is set to false, meaning the stack trace will be included in the response body. However, it can be manually configured as needed within the group of options designated for the consumer side.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "optionsEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Undertow component for an HTTP servlet consumer, and can it be left unspecified if false by default?'
      answer: |
       'The "optionsEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Undertow component for an HTTP Servlet consumer is a boolean property that determines whether to enable HTTP OPTIONS method for this consumer. By default, this option is turned off (i.e., its value is false). It can be left unspecified if you prefer the default behavior as it has no requirement for specification in case false by default is suitable for your needs.'
    - question: 'Given the provided information about the Apache Camel undertow component''s "transferException" option, could you explain when it is beneficial to set this option to true and what potential risks are involved when enabling it?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "transferException" option for the Apache Camel Undertow component allows for exceptions that occur during message exchange processing on the consumer side to be thrown as the original exception instead of being wrapped in an HttpOperationFailedException. This can be beneficial when you want more detailed error information and to preserve the application context of the original error. However, it is important to note that this feature presents a potential security risk. When enabled, Java will deserialize the incoming data from the request which could allow untrusted data to execute arbitrary code within your application. Therefore, consider thoroughly evaluating the risks associated with enabling this option and taking necessary precautions to mitigate any possible vulnerabilities.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the Apache Camel Undertow component to handle exceptions that occur while consuming messages from an incoming connection by bridging them to the Camel routing Error Handler using the `bridgeErrorHandler` option?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel Undertow component to bridge exceptions that occur while consuming messages from an incoming connection to the Camel routing Error Handler, you can set the `bridgeErrorHandler` option to `true`. This will allow any exceptions that occur during message consumption to be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. However, this is only possible if the third-party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. If the component handles exceptions internally only, bridgeErrorHandler will not be possible. In situations where the Camel component can hook into the third-party component, this capability may become available in future releases. By default, the consumer uses the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler` to deal with exceptions, which are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored if `bridgeErrorHandler` is not configured.'
    - question: 'What custom exception handling options are available for the Undertow component in Apache Camel when using the "exceptionHandler" option, and how does this option interact with the "bridgeErrorHandler"? Also, is it necessary to provide a default value for this option, and in what configuration groups can it be found?'
      answer: |
       'When working with the Undertow component in Apache Camel using the "exceptionHandler" option, you can configure a custom ExceptionHandler. However, if the "bridgeErrorHandler" is enabled, the "exceptionHandler" is not in use. By default, exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level will be handled by the consumer, with unhandled exceptions being ignored. The "exceptionHandler" option accepts an object, but does not require a default value, and it can be found in the "consumer (advanced)" configuration group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel "exchangePattern" option under the Undertow component in the context of a consumer, specifically for advanced configurations?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s advanced configurations under the consumer, the "exchangePattern" option within the Undertow component sets the exchange pattern when a consumer creates an exchange. This option allows you to customize how data is exchanged between the producer and consumer. The default value for this option is null, meaning no specific exchange pattern is set by default.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the ''handlers'' option in the Apache Camel component ''undertow'', and what precautions should be taken when using it with different port numbers?'
      answer: |
       'The ''handlers'' option in the Apache Camel component ''undertow'' specifies a comma-delimited set of io.undertow.server.HttpHandler instances that will be added to the Undertow handler chain for handling requests. This feature can be used to add various functionalities, such as security, among others.              It is essential to note that you cannot use different handlers with different Undertow endpoints using the same port number. The handlers are associated with the port number. So, if you require different handlers for different purposes, you must utilize distinct port numbers to achieve this separation. This restriction arises as having multiple handlers on the same port might result in conflicts or unexpected behavior when processing incoming requests.              When using this ''handlers'' option with different port numbers, ensure each setup has its corresponding and unique set of registered handlers, allowing you to control how requests are processed according to your intended requirements for each specific endpoint.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the Apache Camel Undertow component''s cookieHandler option for maintaining an HTTP session in a Camel producer?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel Undertow component''s `cookieHandler` option for maintaining an HTTP session within a Camel producer, you can use the following approach:              Firstly, ensure that the required dependency (Apache Camel Undertow) is included in your project. Then, create a configuration class or update an existing one, where you define your Undertow component and set the `cookieHandler` property to an instance of `javax.servlet.http.CookieHandler`. Here''s a snippet of how you might do that:              ```java       import org.apache.camel.component.undertow.UndertowComponent;       import javax.servlet.http.CookieHandler;       import java.io.Serializable;              public class MyCamelContext extends DefaultCamelContext implements Serializable {           @PostConstruct           public void init() {               UndertowComponent undertowComponent = new UndertowComponent();               undertowComponent.setManagementContextPath("/management");                      CookieHandler cookieHandler = new PersistentCookieManager(); // or any preferred implementation               undertowComponent.getProperties().put("cookieHandler", cookieHandler);               getRouteBuilder().setUndertowComponent(undertowComponent);           }       }       ```              By defining and setting the `cookieHandler`, you have configured an HTTP session using the Apache Camel Undertow component in your Camel producer. Adjust the specific implementation of `CookieHandler` based on your application''s requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and purpose of the "keepAlive" option within the Apache Camel Undertow component, and can it be considered as optional?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the "keepAlive" option in the Apache Camel Undertow component is to be set to true. This option ensures that the socket is not closed due to inactivity. While it is not required, considering it as optional might depend on your use case, particularly in scenarios where long periods of inactivity between data transmissions could lead to connection termination issues.'
    - question: 'What additional options can be set when configuring the Apache Camel Undertow component for channel customization, and how are these options specified in the endpoint URI format?'
      answer: |
       'When configuring the Apache Camel Undertow component for channel customization, you can set additional channel options by using the "options" parameter. The available options that can be used are defined in org.xnio.Options. To configure these options from the endpoint URI format, prefix each option with "option.", such as "option.close-abort=true&option.send-buffer=8192". It is important to note that using this method does not require these options, as they have a default value of null.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "preserveHostHeader" option in the Apache Camel Undertow producer, and when might it be useful to set this option to false rather than keeping its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "preserveHostHeader" option in the Apache Camel Undertow producer is designed to maintain the Host header from the current exchange in the UndertowProducer output, which can be beneficial in reverse proxy applications where it''s crucial for the downstream server to see the URL called by the upstream client. By doing so, applications that depend on the Host header can create accurate URLs for the proxied service. However, setting this option to false may be useful if there''s a specific need to modify or override the Host header before sending the request to the downstream server. The default value of "preserveHostHeader" is true.'
    - question: 'In Apache Camel''s Undertow component, what is the purpose of the optional boolean configuration property named "reuseAddresses" when working with producers? And what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "reuseAddresses" option in Apache Camel''s Undertow component is an optional boolean configuration property designed to facilitate socket multiplexing when working with producers. Its default value is true, which means it enables socket re-use by default. This setting allows multiple connections to be handled on the same port number at the same time, improving overall performance and efficiency in handling HTTP/HTTPS traffic.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel option "tcpNoDelay" for the Undertow component, and is it required for configuration when using the producer?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel option "tcpNoDelay" for the Undertow component aims to enhance the performance of the TCP protocol. Its default value is true, meaning this optimization is applied by default in your setup. However, you should note that it''s an optional setting and not mandatory for the configuration when using the producer.'
    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the "throwExceptionOnFailure" option in the Undertow component of Apache Camel impact the handling of failed responses from a remote server, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "throwExceptionOnFailure" option in the Undertow component of Apache Camel disallows the throwing of HttpOperationFailedException when responses from the remote server fail. This means that all responses, regardless of their HTTP status code, will be received without triggering an exception. The default value for this option is true, which implies that exceptions are thrown for failed responses if this setting is left as is.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in an Apache Camel undertow component affect the behavior of the producer and the CamelContext, and when is it recommended to use this option?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in an Apache Camel Undertow component allows for a delay in starting the producer until the first message is processed. This can be advantageous in situations where initializing the producer during startup may potentially cause issues that could prevent the CamelContext and routes from being started successfully. Instead, errors occurring at startup can be handled through Camel''s routing error handlers, providing more robustness for your application. Keep in mind that starting a producer upon processing the first message might slightly prolong the overall processing time due to the additional time needed to create and initialize the producer. This option is generally recommended when there''s a possibility that the producer may fail during startup and cause issues with route startup, particularly in situations involving advanced Camel producer configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the default access log receiver used in an Apache Camel integration with Undertow, and how does one specify a different implementation if required (for advanced usage)?'
      answer: |
       'The default Access Log Receiver in an Apache Camel integration with Undertow is not explicitly set; it will use JBossLoggingAccessLogReceiver unless specified otherwise. To choose a different implementation, you may specify it when configuring your Undertow component. This setting falls under the "advanced" usage category.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "headerFilterStrategy" option in the Apache Camel Undertow component, and what type is it? Additionally, can this option be left unset, and if so, what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "headerFilterStrategy" option within the Apache Camel Undertow component is designed to allow the use of a custom HeaderFilterStrategy for filtering headers in both incoming (to) and outgoing (from) Camel messages. It''s an "object" type, which implies it can be manipulated using other objects or functions, providing a flexible way to handle header data. This option is marked as "required:false," indicating it''s not always necessary to set this value during component configuration; if left unset, there will be no custom strategy implemented, and the default value for "headerFilterStrategy" is null. The "groups":"advanced" property suggests that this feature is more relevant to advanced users or specific use cases within Apache Camel and Undertow integration.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom UndertowHttpBinding in Apache Camel''s Undertow component to map Camel messages to Undertow effectively, and is the use of this option mandatory or optional in the configuration process?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom UndertowHttpBinding in Apache Camel''s Undertow component, you can make use of the "undertowHttpBinding" option. This allows you to control the mapping between Camel messages and Undertow effectively. It is an optional configuration element, found under the "advanced" group. However, using it is not mandatory for basic usage; you can opt to let Camel generate a default binding if you choose not to specify a custom one.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value, if any, of the "allowedRoles" option in the Apache Camel''s Undertow component, and is its usage mandatory or optional within the security group?'
      answer: |
       'The "allowedRoles" option in the Apache Camel''s Undertow component serves as a configuration for the UndertowSecurityProvider. This option lists the comma-separated roles that are permitted to perform certain actions. It''s important to note that this is a part of the security group, and its usage is optional. By default, there is no predefined value for "allowedRoles."'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel undertow component''s securityConfiguration option to secure my Undertown-based routes in a Camel application? What is an example of an object structure that could be used for this purpose, and which properties or configurations are commonly used within it for providing security features in an UndertowSecurityProvider context?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel undertow component''s securityConfiguration option to secure your Undertow-based routes in a Camel application, you can provide an object as the value for this option that is compatible with the UndertowSecurityProvider. Here''s an example of such an object structure:              ```javascript       {         "realm": "My Realm",         "auth": {           "scheme": "Basic" // or any other scheme supported by UndertowSecurityProvider         },         "certificates": [], // array of trusted certificates (optional)         "authenticationMechanisms": ["ANY"], // array of supported authentication mechanisms (default: ANY)         "loginPath": "/login", // path for login resource (optional, default: "/")         "session": {           "cookieName": "_undertow_sec_", // name of the session cookie (optional, default: "_undertow_sec_")           "maxIdleInterval": 300000, // max time a session can remain idle before being invalidated in milliseconds (optional, default: 604800000)           "invalidateOnRequest": false // whether to invalidate the session on each request (optional, default: true)         }       }       ```              Properties like "realm", "auth", "certificates", "authenticationMechanisms", and "loginPath" are commonly used for providing security features in an UndertowSecurityProvider context. Please note that not all providers may accept or utilize every configuration property provided in the object structure, as it depends on their individual implementation. You should consult the specific provider''s documentation to verify which properties are valid and can be configured according to your application requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel Undertow component''s securityProvider option, and can its usage in securing requests be configured through Service Provider Interface (SPI)?'
      answer: |
       'The "securityProvider" option in the Apache Camel Undertow component serves the purpose of allowing the use of a custom provider to secure incoming requests. This means that additional layers of security can be added as needed for your specific application requirements. By default, it does not have a set value.              Furthermore, the usage of securityProvider in securing requests can indeed be configured through Service Provider Interface (SPI). In such an SPI approach, each endpoint would find its own security provider based on the interface rules. This allows for flexibility and extensibility in managing the security needs across different endpoints in your application.'
    - question: 'How can I configure SSL security using the `sslContextParameters` option in the Apache Camel Undertow component when this option is not required?'
      answer: |
       'To configure SSL security using the `sslContextParameters` option in the Apache Camel Undertow component, even if it''s not required, you can include an empty object or set it to null but ensure that it is included within your route configuration. Here''s a simple example of how to do this:              ```       from("undertow://localhost:8080")           .sslContextParameters(new Properties())           ...       ;       ```              In the given code snippet, you will find an empty object `new Properties()` for the `sslContextParameters`, which signifies that SSL context parameters are not required but still being configured. Keep in mind that any additional configuration such as keyStore, trustStore, password, etc., should be added within this properties object to enable SSL security when using the Undertow component in your Apache Camel application.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the boolean option ''fireWebSocketChannelEvents'' in the Apache Camel component ''undertow'', and what is its default value, and can it be set as a mandatory requirement during configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The boolean option ''fireWebSocketChannelEvents'' in the Apache Camel component ''undertow'' enables posting notifications to a specified route when a new WebSocket peer connects or disconnects. When set to true, it utilizes UndertowConstants.EVENT_TYPE and EventType for these notifications. Its default value is false, and although it''s not mandatory during configuration, it can be configured according to your application requirements within the websocket group.'
    - question: 'What is the default value of the Apache Camel Undertow sendTimeout option in milliseconds and is it required when using this component for a websocket channel?'
      answer: |
       'The default value of the "sendTimeout" option for the Apache Camel Undertow component, when used for a WebSocket channel, is 30000 milliseconds (equivalent to 30 seconds). It is not mandatory to specify this option as its setting is optional.'
    - question: 'How can you utilize the "sendToAll" option within the Apache Camel Undertow component for WebSockets, and what is its default value? Is it necessary to configure this option, and if not, under what conditions would this be applicable?'
      answer: |
       'The "sendToAll" option in the Apache Camel Undertow component for WebSockets allows you to broadcast messages to all connected websocket subscribers directly at the endpoint level, without having to use the UndertowConstants.SEND_TO_ALL header on each message individually. This boolean option is not required and has a default value of null. You can choose to configure it if you wish to send messages to all connections at an endpoint, providing convenience over managing the header for every message. Its applicability depends on your use case and whether broadcasting messages to all connections fits your specific WebSocket communication requirements.'
