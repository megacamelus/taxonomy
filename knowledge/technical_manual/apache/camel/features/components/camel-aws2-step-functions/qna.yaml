seed_examples:
    - question: 'What is the default value and required status for the configuration option when using the Apache Camel AWS2 Step Functions producer component, and are there any specific groups this option belongs to?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the configuration option when using the Apache Camel AWS2 Step Functions producer component is null, and it is not required. This option belongs to the "producer" groups.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Step Functions component affect the behavior of the producer, and under what circumstances might it be beneficial to use this feature?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Step Functions component allows for a more flexible and resilient setup by deferring the startup of the producer until the first message is processed. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where starting the producer may initially cause issues, potentially causing the entire route to fail during startup. By allowing a lazy start, you can handle these initial startup failures using Camel''s routing error handlers, ensuring that your application remains stable and functional.              However, it''s important to be aware that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some additional time, potentially prolonging the overall processing time of each operation. In situations where quick response times are critical or where the cost of a slightly longer initial startup time is unacceptable, you might want to consider leaving this option disabled.'
    - question: 'What is the required option for performing an action such as listing functions, getting a function, creating a function, deleting a function, or invoking a function using the Apache Camel AWS2 Step Functions component?'
      answer: |
       'The required option for performing actions like listing functions, getting a function, creating a function, deleting a function, or invoking a function using the Apache Camel AWS2 Step Functions component is "operation". This option defines the specific action you want to perform, such as listFunctions, getFunction, createFunction, deleteFunction, or invokeFunction.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "overrideEndpoint" option in the Apache Camel aws2-step-functions component, and under what conditions should it be set to true, considering that it requires the use of the "uriEndpointOverride" option?'
      answer: |
       'The "overrideEndpoint" option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Step Functions component is designed to control whether the default endpoint should be overridden. This override is necessary when you want to set a custom endpoint that differs from the standard one. However, it''s crucial to note that using the "overrideEndpoint" requires the simultaneous use of the "uriEndpointOverride" option, which allows you to specify the desired custom endpoint URL. Setting "overrideEndpoint" to true should be done only when there''s a need to change the default endpoint for your AWS Step Functions component in the Camel route.'
    - question: 'Given the information provided, here''s a question that could be asked: "Does the Apache Camel ''aws2-step-functions'' component allow us to send a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) as the body when using it as a producer, and is it optional?"'
      answer: |
       'Yes, the ''aws2-step-functions'' component in Apache Camel does support sending a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) as the body when used as a producer. However, this option is not mandatory, as indicated by its default value being false.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "profileCredentialsName" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Step-Functions component and does it have a default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "profileCredentialsName" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Step-Functions component serves to set the profile name when using a profile credentials provider. This means that if you''re using a specific AWS credentials profile (like those defined in your ~/.aws/credentials), you can use this parameter to specify which one to use. However, it''s important to note that by default, it does not have a value assigned, so if no profile name is provided, Camel will continue to use the default AWS credentials.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "region" option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Step Functions component, and how should its value be specified (including any required format or default value)?'
      answer: |
       'The "region" option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Step Functions component is used to specify the region where the StepFunctions client will operate. To use this parameter, the configuration expects a lowercase name of the region (e.g., ap-east-1). When using it, you should call the method Region.EU_WEST_1.id() instead of directly providing the region name as its value. This option is not mandatory and its default value is null. The "region" option belongs to the producer group of settings in the AWS2 Step Functions component configuration.'
    - question: '"In the context of using Apache Camel''s aws2-step-functions component, what is the purpose and default value of the ''trustAllCertificates'' option when overriding the endpoint, and is it optional?"'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using Apache Camel''s aws2-step-functions component, the ''trustAllCertificates'' option serves the purpose of trusting all certificates in case you choose to override the endpoint. Its default value is false, meaning that it does not trust all certificates by default. This option is optional as indicated by the "required": false property in the configuration.'
    - question: 'In the context of using Apache Camel''s AWS Step Functions component, what is the purpose and usage of the "uriEndpointOverride" option, and under what conditions should it be used in combination with the "overrideEndpoint" option?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using Apache Camel''s AWS Step Functions component, the "uriEndpointOverride" option is designed to allow you to specify an alternate URI endpoint for your AWS resources. This option is particularly useful when you want to use a custom endpoint instead of the default one provided by AWS.              It should be used in combination with the "overrideEndpoint" option, as the "uriEndpointOverride" needs the context provided by "overrideEndpoint" to function correctly. The "overrideEndpoint" option allows Camel to override the original AWS endpoint with a custom one for certain regions or services. When you use both options together, you can effectively customize the URI endpoint of your AWS resources.              However, it''s important to note that using these options is not required; their usage depends on your specific requirements and integrations within your system. These options fall under the "producer" group in the component''s configuration.'
    - question: '"In the context of using the Apache Camel ''aws2-step-functions'' component, what happens when the ''useDefaultCredentialsProvider'' option is set to true or false for the StepFunctions client?"'
      answer: |
       'When you set the ''useDefaultCredentialsProvider'' option to true in the context of using the Apache Camel ''aws2-step-functions'' component, it instructs the StepFunctions client to rely on a default credentials provider to load AWS credentials automatically. This is useful when you don''t want to explicitly pass your AWS credentials into your code or configuration. Conversely, if you set this option to false, you are specifying that you will provide static credentials directly to the StepFunctions client instead of relying on a default credentials provider.'
    - question: '"What is the default value and purpose of the ''useProfileCredentialsProvider'' option in the Apache Camel ''aws2-step-functions'' component, and under what circumstances (if any) would setting it to true be necessary?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''useProfileCredentialsProvider'' option in the Apache Camel ''aws2-step-functions'' component is a boolean configuration that determines whether the StepFunctions client should expect to load credentials through a profile credentials provider. By default, this value is set to false, meaning the credentials are not loaded from a profile. However, setting it to true can be necessary when you want to use AWS credentials configured in your ~/.aws/credentials file or an AWS CLI configuration file. This could apply when you want to switch between different IAM roles without manually updating the access key and secret access key for each operation.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and requirement of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel "aws2-step-functions" component, and when might it be useful to disable or enable this feature?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel "aws2-step-functions" component is a boolean setting that determines whether autowiring is enabled by default. This means it automatically configures components like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, and so on, by looking up in the registry to find a single instance of matching type. The default value is true, meaning autowiring is enabled. You might choose to disable this feature if you prefer manual configuration over automatic one, or if you have specific requirements that are not met with the autowired option. This setting falls under the advanced group, so it''s optional and only needed in cases where you want more control over the configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the option `awsSfnClient` within the Apache Camel `aws2-step-functions` component, and under what circumstances can it be configured with an existing AwsStepFunctionsClient client?'
      answer: |
       'The `awsSfnClient` option within the Apache Camel `aws2-step-functions` component is designed to utilize an already configured `AwsStepFunctionsClient` client. This can be particularly useful in advanced use cases where you have predefined AWS Step Functions clients, such as for specific regions or access credentials. To configure this option, you would pass your existing `AwsStepFunctionsClient` instance during the component configuration, allowing Camel to leverage it instead of creating a new one. This can help optimize resource usage and improve performance in scenarios where multiple routes share the same AWS Step Functions client requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "aws2-step-functions", and can it be required or disabled if needed?'
      answer: |
       'The "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "aws2-step-functions" is a boolean flag used for enabling or disabling all consumer-based health checks from this component. Its default value is true, meaning that health checks are enabled by default. However, it can be disabled if needed as it is an optional setting, marked as "required: false" in the configuration. This option falls under the "health" group of settings, indicating its relevance to the overall system''s health monitoring and maintenance.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "healthCheckProducerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Step Functions component, and can it be required or disabled if not needed?'
      answer: |
       'The "healthCheckProducerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Step Functions component is used to control whether all producer-based health checks are enabled or disabled from this component. By default, its value is set to true. This option is used to enable or disable these checks globally in your application. If you don''t need producer health checks, it can be left as its default value and is not required to be set. It falls under the "health" group of settings. To turn on producer checks globally if they are currently disabled, you can set camel.health.producersEnabled=true in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the "proxyHost" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Step-Functions component, and is it required or optional to use this option when instantiating the StepFunctions client?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyHost" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Step-Functions component is designed to allow you to define a proxy host when instantiating the StepFunctions client. This option is used if your AWS environment requires you to go through a proxy server for communication. However, it does not have a default value, meaning you must provide one if required. The use of this option is optional, as specified in the "groups":"proxy" field; it''s only necessary when working with a setup that requires a proxy server.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "proxyPort" option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Step Functions component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyPort" option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Step Functions component is used to define a proxy port when instantiating the StepFunctions client. Its default value is null, which means no default value is provided. This option is optional as it can be set false if not required for your use case under the "proxy" groups.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "proxyProtocol" option in the Apache Camel component "aws2-step-functions", and what value should it be set to if a proxy protocol is not explicitly defined during the instantiation of the StepFunctions client?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyProtocol" option in the AWS2 Step Functions component within Apache Camel serves to define a proxy protocol when initializing the StepFunctions client, although its use is optional. When no explicit proxy protocol is set during the instantiation, the default value of this option is HTTPS.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, group affiliation, and required status of the option "accessKey" in the Apache Camel component "aws2-step-functions"?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessKey" option within the Apache Camel component "aws2-step-functions" serves the purpose of providing an Amazon AWS Access Key. This option is of data type string, and its default value is null. It belongs to the security group of options as it involves sensitive credentials. The "required" status for this option is false, meaning you can choose whether or not to provide an accessKey when using the component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''secretKey'' option within the Apache Camel component ''aws2-step-functions'', if it is not required, and where this option falls under in terms of security concerns?'
      answer: |
       'The ''secretKey'' option within the Apache Camel component ''aws2-step-functions'' serves as an Amazon AWS Secret Key. This key is used to authenticate requests made from your application to AWS services. However, it''s important to note that the ''defaultValue'' for this option is null, indicating it is not required for every use case. Despite being optional, its relevance lies in the ''security'' group as managing AWS secrets requires careful handling due to their sensitive nature. When using such keys, it''s always recommended to follow best security practices, such as storing them securely and limiting access where possible.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "sessionToken" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Step-Functions component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "sessionToken" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Step-Functions component is used to provide an Amazon AWS Session Token when the user needs to assume an IAM role. This token is not a default value and must be provided if needed, as it''s an optional parameter marked as such in the configuration. The group associated with this option is "security".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "useSessionCredentials" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Step-Functions component and can it be set to true or false? Also, what is its default value and under which category is it considered important for security reasons?'
      answer: |
       'The "useSessionCredentials" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Step-Functions component is designed to specify whether the Step Functions client should utilize Session Credentials during operations. This feature becomes useful when the user needs to assume an IAM role for executing tasks within Step Functions. It can be set to either true or false, with the default value being false. This option falls under the category of security as it allows for secure access and operation in AWS Step Functions by assuming IAM roles for required operations.'
    - question: 'What is the required option for performing different operations within the Apache Camel component aws2-step-functions when producing messages, and what are the possible values for this operation?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s aws2-step-functions component, the required option for performing various operations while producing messages is "operation". The allowed values for this option are: listFunctions, getFunction, createFunction, deleteFunction, or invokeFunction. These options determine the specific action to be taken within AWS Step Functions.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of using the "overrideEndpoint" option in the Apache Camel component "aws2-step-functions", and under what conditions should it be used, considering it needs to be utilized alongside the "uriEndpointOverride" option?'
      answer: |
       'The "overrideEndpoint" option in the Apache Camel AWS Step Functions component allows you to specify a scenario where the endpoint should be overridden. This option is meant to be used together with the "uriEndpointOverride" option. You should use this feature when there''s a need for changing the default endpoint URL, such as testing against a different environment or integrating with a custom-built AWS Step Functions service. However, it''s important to note that using these options is optional and setting them to false will keep the default endpoint intact.'
    - question: '"In the Apache Camel component ''aws2-step-functions'', can I use a POJO object as the message body when sending a message, and if so, how do I configure it?"'
      answer: |
       'Yes, in the AWS Step Functions component for Apache Camel (`aws2-step-functions`), you can indeed use a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) as the message body when sending a message. To achieve this, you need to set the `pojoRequest` option to `true`. This configuration option is under the `groups` named "producer".              Here''s an example of how to configure it:              ```xml       <bean id="aws2StepFunctionsProducer" class="org.apache.camel.component.aws2.stepfunctions.StepFunctionsComponent">           <property name="pojoRequest" value="true"/>           <!-- Other configurations go here -->       </bean>       ```              With this setup, you can use your POJO as the message body when using the `aws2-step-functions` producer.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "profileCredentialsName" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Step-Functions component and what value should be provided if a profile credentials provider is used to set the profile name?'
      answer: |
       'The "profileCredentialsName" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Step-Functions component allows you to set a specific AWS profile when using a profile credentials provider. When using this option, the value you should provide is the name of your chosen AWS CLI profile. If no value is provided or this parameter is not used, it defaults to using the default AWS CLI profile.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "region" option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Step Functions component, and how should it be specified when using this parameter? Also, is it mandatory to provide a value for this option, and if not, what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "region" option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Step Functions component specifies the region where the StepFunctions client should operate. It''s essential to use the lowercase name of the region (for example, ap-east-1), not the ID (Region.EU_WEST_1.id()). While providing a value for this option is not mandatory, there is no default value assigned to it in the given configuration. The "region" option falls under the "producer" group of settings.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel aws2-step-functions component to trust all SSL certificates when overriding the endpoint for a producer?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the AWS Step Functions component in Apache Camel to trust all SSL certificates when overriding the endpoint for a producer, you can set the "trustAllCertificates" option to true. Here''s how:              ```java       from("aws2-step-functions://myEndpoint")           .bean(MyProducer.class)           // Trust all SSL certificates           .option(Option.trustAllCertificates, true);       ```              In the provided configuration, replace "myEndpoint" with your actual AWS Step Functions endpoint and "MyProducer" with your producer class. By default, this option is set to false, but setting it to true will make your component trust all SSL certificates.'
    - question: 'Here is a question that can be answered using the provided information:              What is the purpose and default value of the "uriEndpointOverride" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Step-Functions component, and under what conditions should it be used? Additionally, what type is this option and is its use optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'The "uriEndpointOverride" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Step-Functions component serves to set an overriding URI endpoint for a specific purpose. This option should be utilized in conjunction with the "overrideEndpoint" option. Its default value is null, meaning it''s not predefined. This option is of type string and its usage is optional, not required. It falls under the producer group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''useDefaultCredentialsProvider'' option in the Apache Camel AWS2-StepFunctions component, and can it be considered as a required configuration parameter when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The ''useDefaultCredentialsProvider'' option in the Apache Camel AWS2-StepFunctions component determines whether the StepFunctions client should load credentials through a default provider or accept static credentials provided explicitly. By default, it is set to false, meaning that static credentials will not be used unless explicitly passed. While this option is not required, producers may choose to set it based on their specific use case and credential management strategy.'
    - question: 'How does setting the option "useProfileCredentialsProvider" to true in the Apache Camel component "aws2-step-functions" affect the behavior of the StepFunctions client regarding the loading of credentials?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the option "useProfileCredentialsProvider" to true in the Apache Camel component "aws2-step-functions" allows the StepFunctions client to load credentials through a profile credentials provider. This means that if you have AWS CLI configured with a specified profile, the client will use those credentials when interacting with Amazon Web Services Step Functions services. If set to false (the default value), the client will not load credentials through a profile and will instead rely on hardcoded access keys or the AWS SDK''s shared credentials file.'
    - question: 'How does the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Step Functions component affect the behavior of the producer, and why might it be useful to set it to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Step Functions component allows you to defer the startup of the producer until the first message is processed. This can be beneficial in scenarios where starting the producer during the initialization phase might cause issues, leading to the overall failure of the route.              By setting "lazyStartProducer" to true, you enable a more resilient approach, as any errors that occur during producer startup can be handled through Camel''s routing error handlers, allowing the rest of your route to continue functioning. However, please be aware that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some additional time, which could prolong the total processing time of the processing. This option is particularly useful within the "producer (advanced)" group in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and configuration options for using an existing AwsStepFunctionsClient in the Apache Camel aws2-step-functions component, specifically regarding the option named "awsSfnClient"?'
      answer: |
       'The option "awsSfnClient" in the Apache Camel aws2-step-functions component is designed to allow you to utilize an existing AwsStepFunctionsClient client. This means that instead of creating a new instance of the AWS Step Functions client each time, you can configure and reuse an existing one for improved performance and consistency. The "awsSfnClient" option accepts an object as its value, which you can set according to your specific configuration needs. However, it is important to note that this option is considered advanced, and its use may not be required for basic integrations with AWS Step Functions.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "proxyHost" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Step-Functions component, and is it required or optional to use this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyHost" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Step-Functions component is intended for defining a proxy host when initializing the StepFunctions client. It does not have a default value. Whether you need to use this option depends on your specific setup, as it''s optional and can be skipped if no proxy is required.
