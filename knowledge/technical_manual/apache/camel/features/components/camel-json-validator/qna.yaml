    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel json-validator component, and under what circumstances might it be beneficial to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel json-validator component allows for a producer to be started lazily (on the first message), rather than during the initial startup of the route or CamelContext. This can be beneficial when a producer may otherwise fail during the starting phase, causing the entire route to fail. By deferring the startup to a lazy mode, any startup failures can be handled through Camel''s routing error handlers. However, keep in mind that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time, thereby prolonging the overall processing time of the component. The default value for this option is false.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel json-validator component, and under what circumstances might it be useful to configure this option to false?'
      answer: |
       'The ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel json-validator component is a boolean parameter with a default value of true. Its purpose is to control whether autowiring is enabled for automatic configuring components like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. When set to true, it allows the component to look up in the registry and find a single instance of matching type to be configured automatically.              However, there might be instances where you would want to configure this option to false. This could occur when you wish to explicitly manage the configuration of these components rather than allowing them to be autowired. For example, if you need to customize specific connection properties or security settings for your JDBC data source, setting ''autowiredEnabled'' to false would help in achieving that level of control.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "objectMapper" option in the Apache Camel json-validator component, and can it be configured with a custom ObjectMapper in advanced settings?'
      answer: |
       'The "objectMapper" option in the Apache Camel json-validator component is designed for using a custom ObjectMapper. By default, it has no predefined value. If you wish to configure it with your own ObjectMapper in advanced settings, you can do so as this option supports the use of a custom ObjectMapper.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, and potential risks associated with the Apache Camel component json-validator option called "allowContextMapAll", and under what group this option can be used in a producer configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "allowContextMapAll" option for the Apache Camel component "json-validator" allows you to set whether the context map should have access to all details beyond just the message body and headers. By default, only these two elements are accessible due to security concerns. Enabling this option grants full access to the current Exchange and CamelContext, which includes the full power of the CamelContext API. However, it''s essential to note that enabling this option poses a potential security risk as it opens up access to all parts of the CamelContext, potentially exposing sensitive data or functionality. This option can be used under the "producer" group in your configuration.'
    - question: 'How is the default value and usage of the "contentCache" option in the Apache Camel''s json-validator component, and under what group (producer) can it be configured? (The contentCache option determines whether to use resource content cache or not, and it is a boolean type with a default value of false.)'
      answer: |
       'The "contentCache" option in Apache Camel''s json-validator component has a default value of false, indicating that resource content caching is not enabled by default. This option can be configured under the "producer" group, allowing you to determine whether to use resource content cache or not during JSON validation.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior, and whether it''s required for the Apache Camel json-validator component''s "failOnNullBody" option when used as a producer?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the "failOnNullBody" option in the Apache Camel json-validator component, when used as a producer, is to be set to true, meaning it will fail if no body exists. However, setting this parameter as required is optional.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the Apache Camel json-validator component to allow for validation of JSON messages if a specified header does not exist in the message, instead of failing the validation?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel json-validator component to allow for validation of JSON messages even if the specified header does not exist in the message, you can set the "failOnNullHeader" option to false. This can be achieved by modifying the json-validator component like this:              ```       json-validator(failOnNullHeader=false, ...)       ```              By default, validation fails if no header exists. Setting failOnNullHeader to false allows for validation to proceed without requiring the specified header.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "headerName" option in the Apache Camel json-validator component, and under which group (producer or consumer) is this option typically used?'
      answer: |
       'The "headerName" option in the Apache Camel json-validator component serves to validate JSON data against a specific header instead of the message body. Its default value is null, meaning no default header name is set. This option belongs to the "producer" group, which refers to components that produce messages (send data). Therefore, you would typically use this option when configuring how your producer sends messages with validated header content.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel json-validator component, and under what circumstances might it be useful to set this option to true instead of its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel json-validator component allows you to defer the startup of the associated producer until the first message is processed. This can be beneficial in situations where starting the producer might cause an initial failure during context or route startup, potentially preventing the entire route from being started. By using this lazy start option, you can handle such startup failures during routing messages through Camel''s error handlers. However, setting this option to true may slightly prolong the total processing time as creating and starting the producer upon the first message might take some additional time. This option is considered advanced and is part of the "producer (advanced)" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default setting of the "disabledDeserializationFeatures" option within the Apache Camel json-validator component, and what type of data should it accept? Additionally, can this option be considered mandatory when using this component, and under which group settings is it categorized?'
      answer: |
       'The "disabledDeserializationFeatures" option in the Apache Camel json-validator component is designed to disable certain Jackson DeserializationFeature values during the parsing of an exchange body. This allows you to control how JSON data is deserialized according to your specific requirements. By default, it accepts no value (null), meaning all Jackson deserialization features are enabled. It''s important to note that this option is not mandatory and can be configured at your discretion within the advanced group settings in Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "enabledDeserializationFeatures" option in the Apache Camel json-validator component, and can it be omitted if not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The "enabledDeserializationFeatures" option in the Apache Camel json-validator component serves to enable a comma-separated list of Jackson DeserializationFeature enum values during JSON body parsing. This option allows you to customize the behavior of how your JSON is deserialized. However, it''s not mandatory; if this option is not specified in your configuration, its default value will be null, meaning that no specific deserialization features are enabled by default.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "errorHandler" option in the Apache Camel json-validator component, and what happens if this option is not set (i.e., it uses its default value)?'
      answer: |
       'The "errorHandler" option in the Apache Camel json-validator component allows you to use a custom ValidatorErrorHandler. When not set, the default error handler will capture the errors and throw an exception. This means that if you don''t specify a custom error handler, the validation process will still continue, but any errors encountered during validation will cause an exception to be thrown.'
    - question: 'What is the default and optional, advanced-grouped configuration for the objectMapper option in Apache Camel''s json-validator component? The objectMapper is described as the Jackson object mapper.'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `objectMapper` option in Apache Camel''s json-validator component is null, meaning no specific Jackson ObjectMapper is set by default. However, it can be configured as an optional, advanced-grouped setting. This allows you to use your own instance of the Jackson ObjectMapper for custom mapping needs within your JSON validation process.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the option `uriSchemaLoader` in the Apache Camel''s json-validator component, and is it required for usage? (Answer: It allows for adding custom format validation using a custom schema loader. The default implementation tries to determine the schema version from the $schema property of the specified schema, and it is not required for usage as its default value is null.)'
      answer: |
       'The option `uriSchemaLoader` in Apache Camel''s json-validator component allows you to use a custom schema loader, enabling the addition of custom format validation. By default, it employs an implementation that attempts to discern the schema version from the $schema property within the specified schema. However, its default value is null, indicating that it is not required for usage.'
