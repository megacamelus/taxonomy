    - question: 'What is the default value for the option "clientTelemetryEnabled" when using the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and is it required to enable telemetry collection on cosmos monitoring service?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the option "clientTelemetryEnabled" when using the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" is false, indicating that telemetry collection on Cosmos Monitoring Service is an opt-in feature. Therefore, it''s not required to enable telemetry collection if you don''t wish to do so.'
    - question: 'What are the possible configuration options for the Azure Cosmos DB component in Apache Camel, and is it required to provide these configurations when using this component? (Answer: The possible configuration options for the Azure Cosmos DB component in Apache Camel can be found in the "configuration" field under the "description". It is not required to provide these configurations as indicated by the "required" field being set to false.)'
      answer: |
       'The Azure Cosmos DB component in Apache Camel offers a variety of configuration options, which are detailed under the "configuration" field in its description. However, providing these configurations is not a strict requirement when utilizing this component, as it''s indicated by the "required" field being set to false.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "connectionSharingAcrossClientsEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and under what circumstances would it be beneficial to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "connectionSharingAcrossClientsEnabled" option in the Azure Cosmos DB component of Apache Camel is designed to allow connection sharing across multiple Cosmos Client instances within the same Java Virtual Machine (JVM). When you have multiple instances of Cosmos Clients interacting with multiple Cosmos accounts, enabling this option allows connection sharing in Direct mode if possible between instances of Cosmos Client.              However, it''s important to note that when setting this option to true, the connection configuration (such as socket timeout and idle timeout) of the first instantiated client will be used for all other client instances. This means that any changes made to the connection configuration in subsequent client instances will not take effect.              Setting this option to true can be beneficial under circumstances where you have multiple Cosmos Client instances, each interacting with a different Cosmos account, and where efficient resource utilization is a concern due to the overhead of establishing new connections for each instance.'
    - question: 'What are the different consistency levels supported by the Azure Cosmos DB component in Apache Camel for setting the consistency level of client operations, and what is the default value of this option if not explicitly specified?'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel when working with Azure Cosmos DB, the consistency levels supported for client operations are STRONG, BOUNDED_STALENESS, SESSION, and EVENTUAL. These levels are ordered by strength, with STRONG being the strongest and EVENTUAL being the weakest. The default value for this option is "SESSION" if not explicitly specified. For more detailed information about consistency levels in Azure Cosmos DB, please refer to the documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "containerPartitionKeyPath" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "containerPartitionKeyPath" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" sets the container partition key path for organizing data across partitions in Cosmos DB. Its default value is null, meaning that if not specified, Cosmos DB will automatically generate a partition key for you. This option is not required when using this component, but setting it can help optimize performance by allowing you to control how your data is distributed across partitions in Cosmos DB.'
    - question: 'How does the "contentResponseOnWriteEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Azure Cosmos DB component behave differently between a Consumer and a Producer scenario, and is it required or recommended to modify its default value in these scenarios?'
      answer: |
       'In an Apache Camel Azure Cosmos DB context, the "contentResponseOnWriteEnabled" option determines whether the full response is returned from Cosmos DB when performing Create, Update, and Delete operations on CosmosItem. By default, this option is set to true in a Consumer scenario due to the ChangeFeed, which requires this flag to be enabled. However, it''s recommended not to override this value in a Producer scenario as enabling it reduces network overhead unnecessarily.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the option "cosmosAsyncClient" in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and is it possible to use this option without providing a default value?'
      answer: |
       'The option "cosmosAsyncClient" in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" allows you to inject an external instance of CosmosAsyncClient into the component. This asynchronous client is used to configure and execute requests against the Azure Cosmos DB service. While it''s not required, you can choose to use this option without providing a default value if you prefer to manage your own CosmosAsyncClient instance outside of the Camel context.'
    - question: 'What is the default setting for the option "createContainerIfNotExists" in the Apache Camel azure-cosmosdb component, and is it required to set this option if we don''t explicitly want the container to be created if it doesn''t exist in the Cosmos database?'
      answer: |
       'The default setting for the "createContainerIfNotExists" option in the Apache Camel azure-cosmosdb component is false, meaning that the component will not create the Cosmos container automatically if it doesn''t exist in the Cosmos database. However, you are not required to set this option explicitly if you don''t want the container to be created when it doesn''t exist.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and whether it''s mandatory to set the "createDatabaseIfNotExists" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and if it has a group under which this setting can be found?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "createDatabaseIfNotExists" option in the Azure Cosmos DB component of Apache Camel is set to false, meaning that the database will not be created automatically if it doesn''t exist in your Cosmos account. This option can be found under the common group of settings and is not mandatory to set, allowing you to manually manage the creation of the database if desired.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "databaseEndpoint" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and is it a required configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseEndpoint" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" is crucial for setting the Azure Cosmos database endpoint that the component will connect to for communication purposes. It''s important to note that this option has no default value, meaning you must provide it during configuration. Moreover, yes, it is a required configuration within the "common" group of settings in your integration setup.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `multipleWriteRegionsEnabled` option to `true` in the Apache Camel component `azure-cosmosdb` impact write operations for geo-replicated Azure Cosmos DB accounts, and what is the default value of this option?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `multipleWriteRegionsEnabled` option to `true` in the Apache Camel component `azure-cosmosdb` enables writes on any regions for geo-replicated Azure Cosmos DB accounts. When this property is true, write operations will be directed to available writable regions of the geo-replicated database account, prioritized by the PreferredRegions property. It''s important to note that setting the property value to true has no effect unless `EnableMultipleWriteRegions` in DatabaseAccount is also set to true. The default value of this option is `true`, indicating that writes are directed to available writable regions of geo-replicated database accounts.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "preferredRegions" option in the Apache Camel component for Azure Cosmos DB, and what is its default value, type, and whether it''s required or not? Also, can you explain how the "EnableEndpointDiscovery" setting interacts with the "PreferredRegions" when they are both set?'
      answer: |
       'The "preferredRegions" option in the Apache Camel component for Azure Cosmos DB is used to set the preferred geo-replicated regions for database accounts. It accepts a comma-separated list of regions, such as "East US", where the specified region will be prioritized when performing operations. The default value for this option is null, and it is not required.              When the "EnableEndpointDiscovery" setting is true and "PreferredRegions" is non-empty, the SDK will prefer to use the regions in the order they are specified to execute operations, enhancing efficiency and optimizing performance based on the chosen regions.'
    - question: 'What is the default value of the readRequestsFallbackEnabled option in the Apache Camel component azure-cosmosdb when using an Azure Cosmos DB account with multiple regions, and does the default change depending on the consistency level set for the operation? Additionally, under what circumstances would the default value of this option be false?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of the Apache Camel component azure-cosmosdb, when using an Azure Cosmos DB account with multiple regions, the default value of the readRequestsFallbackEnabled option is true, unless you''re operating at the Bounded Staleness consistency level, where the default becomes false. This property determines whether reads can go to multiple regions configured on your account. The default behavior is governed by the endpointDiscoveryEnabled setting: if it''s enabled (as in your scenario), then readRequestsFallbackEnabled defaults to true for all Consistency Levels other than Bounded Staleness, and false for Bounded Staleness specifically. In summary, the default value of this option would be false under the Bounded Staleness consistency level, provided that endpointDiscoveryEnabled is also set to true, and your Azure Cosmos DB account has more than one region.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "throughputProperties" option within the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and is it required or optional when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "throughputProperties" option within the Azure Cosmos DB component in Apache Camel is used to set the throughput of resources in the Azure Cosmos DB service. It does not have a default value. Whether to use this option is optional, as indicated by the "required: false" attribute in its definition.'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" handle exceptions thrown by the Cosmos DB consumer while trying to pickup incoming messages, and can this behavior be customized using the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the configuration? If so, what is the default behavior when "bridgeErrorHandler" is set to false, and what are the implications when it''s set to true?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" initially handles exceptions thrown by the Cosmos DB consumer while attempting to pick up incoming messages using the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler`. By default, such exceptions will be logged at either WARN or ERROR level and then ignored.              However, you can customize this behavior using the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the configuration. When "bridgeErrorHandler" is set to true, exceptions are processed as messages and handled by the Camel routing Error Handler rather than being ignored. This requires that the third-party component (in this case, Cosmos DB) allows Camel to be notified if an exception was thrown. If the component handles exceptions internally only, bridgeErrorHandler is not possible.              When "bridgeErrorHandler" is set to false by default, exceptions are handled as described above—they will be logged and ignored. Setting it to true has the implication of more graceful error handling for your application, as exceptions are processed as messages instead of being discarded.'
    - question: 'What are the default values for the "maximum items per page or FeedResponse" and "lease renew interval" in the changeFeedProcessorOptions of the Apache Camel component azure-cosmosdb, and what is the purpose of setting these options?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of the Azure Cosmos DB component within Apache Camel, the default values for the "maximum items per page or FeedResponse" and "lease renew interval" in the changeFeedProcessorOptions are 100 items per page and 17 seconds for lease renew interval respectively. These options are crucial for managing the rate at which data is processed from the change feed, as well as the duration between lease renewals, respectively. Adjusting these settings can help optimize the performance of your application based on specific use-case requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "createLeaseContainerIfNotExists" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and is it mandatory to set this option when using the consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The "createLeaseContainerIfNotExists" option within the Azure Cosmos DB component of Apache Camel determines whether the component should automatically create a lease container for the consumer, if one does not already exist in the Cosmos database. By default, this option is set to false, meaning that the lease container will not be created unless explicitly specified. However, it''s important to note that setting this option is not mandatory when using the consumer.'
    - question: 'Here is a question that utilizes the provided information:              "What does the ''createLeaseDatabaseIfNotExists'' option do within the context of using the Apache Camel component azure-cosmosdb, and when is it set to create the Cosmos lease database automatically for the consumer?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''createLeaseDatabaseIfNotExists'' option in the context of using the Apache Camel component azure-cosmosdb allows you to specify whether the component should create the Cosmos lease database for the consumer automatically, in case it doesn''t exist within the Cosmos account. By default, it is set to false, meaning that the lease database will not be created if it does not already exist. However, setting this option to true will ensure that the Cosmos lease database is created for the consumer when necessary.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "hostName" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and can it be left empty or is a default value provided for it? Also, why might it be necessary to specify a unique instance name if multiple instances are running with the same lease configuration?'
      answer: |
       'In the Azure Cosmos DB component of Apache Camel, the "hostName" option allows you to set a specific hostname for your application instance that utilizes the change feed processor to monitor changes. If you do not specify a hostname, one will be generated automatically as a random value. It''s important to provide a unique instance name for each instance running with the same lease configuration if multiple instances are operating in parallel, as this helps maintain proper synchronization and avoid conflicts. Each instance should have a distinct instance name to ensure efficient operation within the same lease configuration setup.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "leaseContainerName" option when using the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and under what circumstances will it be created if not already existing?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "leaseContainerName" option when using the Azure Cosmos DB component in Apache Camel is "camel-lease". This option sets the lease container, which functions as a state storage and coordinates processing changes fed across multiple workers within your application. You can store this lease container either in the same account as the monitored container or in a separate one. If you set "createLeaseContainerIfNotExists" to true, the lease container will be auto-created if it does not already exist.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "leaseDatabaseName" option in the Apache Camel component azure-cosmosdb, and under what circumstances would it be automatically created if not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The "leaseDatabaseName" option in the Azure CosmosDB component for Apache Camel is used to specify the lease database where the leaseContainerName will be stored. If this option is not provided, the component will store the lease container in the same database that has been specified through the "databaseName". If the parameter ''createLeaseDatabaseIfNotExists'' is set to true, the lease database will automatically be created if it does not already exist. The default value for "leaseDatabaseName" is null.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "itemId" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and is it required when performing operations such as delete or replace? Also, what should be its default value and data type?'
      answer: |
       'The "itemId" option in the Azure Cosmos DB component of Apache Camel is intended for setting the item Id during an operation on an item like delete or replace. However, it''s not mandatory to provide this value as it has a default value of null. When provided, it should be a string data type.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "itemPartitionKey" option within the Apache Camel "azure-cosmosdb" component, and is it a required parameter or can it be omitted?'
      answer: |
       'The "itemPartitionKey" option in the Azure Cosmos DB component for Apache Camel sets the partition key. This partition key value identifies the partition where an item (data) is stored within an Azure Cosmos DB database service. Its default value is null, meaning you must provide a value when using this option if you want to specify a partition key. While it''s not a required parameter, leaving it out might result in the system automatically determining the partition for your data. This feature exists under the "producer" group of options.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component Azure Cosmos DB affect the behavior of the producer, and when is it beneficial to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component for Azure Cosmos DB allows the producer to be started lazily, i.e., on the first message. This can be useful when starting the producer may otherwise cause the route to fail during startup, preventing the CamelContext and routes from being initialized successfully. By deferring the startup of the producer, you can handle any failure during routing messages using Camel''s error handlers.              However, it is important to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time, potentially prolonging the overall processing time of the messages. Therefore, when the component encounters a situation where the producer may fail during startup, setting this option to true can help ensure the successful initialization of your Camel routes in Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the default CosmosDB operation that can be specified when using the Apache Camel''s azure-cosmosdb component on the producer side, and is it required to provide this option? (Hint: Check the description, defaultValue, type, required fields of the azure-cosmosdb''s "operation" option)'
      answer: |
       'The default CosmosDB operation when using Apache Camel''s `azure-cosmosdb` component on the producer side is to list the databases, as indicated by the `defaultValue` field being set to `listDatabases`. However, it is not required to provide this option as it has been marked as optional, as stated in the `required` field.'
    - question: 'What is the format and syntax for an SQL query that can be used with the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" option named "query", as described in its documentation which suggests using Cosmos SQL API? Are there any specific rules or guidelines to follow when constructing this query?'
      answer: |
       'The format for an SQL query that can be used with the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" option named "query" follows the syntax of Cosmos SQL API queries. You can find more detailed information about this in the documentation provided by Microsoft at <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql-query-getting-started>. When constructing your query, it''s important to adhere to the SQL rules and guidelines as outlined in the Cosmos DB documentation. This includes proper use of keywords, syntax, operators, and functions for selecting, filtering, sorting, and grouping data within your collection.'
    - question: 'What are the possible usage scenarios and customizations available when using the `queryRequestOptions` option in the Apache Camel component `azure-cosmosdb`, and what is its default value and required status?'
      answer: |
       'The `queryRequestOptions` option in the Azure Cosmos DB component of Apache Camel allows for setting additional QueryRequestOptions that can be utilized across various operations such as queryItems, queryContainers, queryDatabases, listDatabases, listItems, and listContainers. This provides flexibility to customize your requests according to specific needs. The default value for `queryRequestOptions` is null, indicating no predefined values are assigned by default. It''s also worth noting that the usage of `queryRequestOptions` is optional within the "producer" group of settings in your Camel configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior for setting the Indexing Policy in an Azure Cosmos DB container when using Apache Camel''s azure-cosmosdb component, and under what conditions can a custom Indexing Policy be specified?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for setting the Indexing Policy in an Azure Cosmos DB container, when using Apache Camel''s `azure-cosmosdb` component, is that no Indexing Policy is set by default. However, a custom Indexing Policy can be specified under the condition where `createLeaseContainerIfNotExists` is true. The Indexing Policy is an advanced option and can be found in the group of "advanced" settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb"? Additionally, can this option be set to false instead of its default value if needed?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in the Azure Cosmos DB component of Apache Camel is a boolean setting that determines whether autowiring is enabled. When set to true (the default value), it allows for automatic configuration of components such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, and more by looking up in the registry to find a single instance of matching type. If you wish to disable this feature and configure the component manually, you can set "autowiredEnabled" to false instead of its default value. This option falls under the advanced group of configuration options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and required status of the option named "accountKey" in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and which security group does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The "accountKey" option in the Azure CosmosDB component of Apache Camel is designed for setting either a master or readonly key used for authentication when accessing the resource. Its default value is null, meaning no key is set by default. This option''s data type is string and it is not required to be provided. The "accountKey" option falls under the security group of settings in the context of using Azure CosmosDB with Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the option "credentialType" in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and what purpose does this option serve with regards to the credential strategy when working with Azure Cosmos DB?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "credentialType" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" is "SHARED_ACCOUNT_KEY". This option governs the strategy for credentials, which are essential for accessing your Azure Cosmos DB account. By setting the credential type to "SHARED_ACCOUNT_KEY", you''re opting for using the Account Key (API key) as a shared secret for authentication when working with Azure Cosmos DB in your integration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the option "clientTelemetryEnabled" in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and what effect does setting it to true have on the data processing?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the option "clientTelemetryEnabled" in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" is set to false, indicating that client telemetry collection is an opt-in feature. When you set it to true, periodic aggregation statistics of database operations and system information like cpu/memory will be collected and sent to the Cosmos monitoring service for debugging purposes. This means that additional data beyond your main processing task will be transmitted during operation.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "connectionSharingAcrossClientsEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" impact connection settings, and what is its default value when not explicitly set?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "connectionSharingAcrossClientsEnabled" option in the Azure Cosmos DB component of Apache Camel allows for connection sharing across multiple Cosmos Client instances within the same Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that if you have multiple instances of Cosmos Client interacting with multiple Cosmos accounts, this feature can facilitate connection sharing in Direct mode between these instances.              However, it''s important to note that when setting this option, the connection configuration (such as socket timeout and idle timeout configurations) of the first instantiated client will be used for all other client instances. This means that any settings you customize on subsequent clients will not apply individually but will be based on the initial client''s settings. The default value for this option is false, meaning connection sharing across clients is disabled by default.'
    - question: 'What are the available consistency levels that can be set using the "consistencyLevel" option when working with the Apache Camel Azure Cosmos DB component, and in what order do they appear from strongest to weakest? Also, what is the default value for this option if no specific level is specified?'
      answer: |
       'When working with the Apache Camel Azure Cosmos DB component, the available consistency levels that can be set using the "consistencyLevel" option are STRONG, BOUNDED_STALENESS, SESSION, and EVENTUAL. These levels appear from strongest to weakest in the order mentioned. The default value for this option if no specific level is specified is SESSION. For more information about these consistency levels, please refer to Microsoft''s documentation at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the "containerPartitionKeyPath" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "containerPartitionKeyPath" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" serves to set the container''s partition key path. This value, if provided, helps Cosmos DB distribute data across multiple partitions for efficient data retrieval. By default, this option has no value assigned to it, meaning you can choose to specify a custom partition key or let Azure Cosmos DB automatically generate one. Using this option is not mandatory when utilizing the "azure-cosmosdb" component, as it is an optional configuration setting under the "common" group.'
    - question: 'What is the recommended setting for the "contentResponseOnWriteEnabled" option in Apache Camel''s azure-cosmosdb component when using it as a producer, and why does this setting help reduce network overhead?'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s azure-cosmosdb component, when used as a producer, it is recommended to set the "contentResponseOnWriteEnabled" option to false. This setting helps reduce network overhead because, in producers, it is not necessary for the entire Cosmos DB response to be returned; only the headers and status code are required. By disabling this option, less data is sent over the network, thereby improving performance and reducing potential bandwidth usage.'
    - question: 'How can I inject an external CosmosAsyncClient object into the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" to use it for configuring and executing requests against an Azure Cosmos DB service asynchronously, if I don''t want to use the default value?'
      answer: |
       'To inject an external `CosmosAsyncClient` object into the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" for asynchronous usage with the Azure Cosmos DB service, you can leverage the "cosmosAsyncClient" option. This option allows you to provide your own instance of the `CosmosAsyncClient`. Here''s how to do it:              1. Create an instance of `CosmosAsyncClient` with the necessary configuration.       2. Pass this instance as a property during the creation of the "azure-cosmosdb" component, like so:              ```java       CosmosAsyncClient myCustomCosmosAsyncClient = ... // Your custom CosmosAsyncClient instance              from("direct:start")           .to("azure-cosmosdb:" + YOUR_DATABASE + "/" + YOUR_CONTAINER + "?cosmosAsyncClient=" + myCustomCosmosAsyncClient);       ```              This way, you can use your custom `CosmosAsyncClient` object for configuring and executing requests against the Azure Cosmos DB service asynchronously without relying on the default value.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of setting the "createContainerIfNotExists" option to false when using the Azure Cosmos DB component within Apache Camel, and is it required to set this option?'
      answer: |
       'When using the Azure Cosmos DB component within Apache Camel, the default behavior of setting the "createContainerIfNotExists" option to false means that the container will not be created automatically in case it doesn''t exist in the Cosmos database. However, it is not required to set this option as it is an optional configuration.'
    - question: 'Here is a question that can be answered with the provided information:              What does the "createDatabaseIfNotExists" option do for the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "createDatabaseIfNotExists" option for the Azure Cosmos DB component in Apache Camel sets whether the component should create the Cosmos database automatically if it does not exist in your Cosmos account. By default, this option is set to false.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and required nature (true or false) of the "databaseEndpoint" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and what is its default value and data type?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseEndpoint" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" is required (true), meaning it must be provided when configuring the component. Its purpose is to set the Azure Cosmos DB endpoint that the component will connect to during communication. The default value for this option is null, and its data type is a string.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "multipleWriteRegionsEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and when should it be set to false?'
      answer: |
       'The "multipleWriteRegionsEnabled" option in the Azure Cosmos DB component for Apache Camel is a boolean property with a default value of true. This setting determines whether writes are directed to available writable regions of geo-replicated database accounts in the Azure Cosmos DB service. When multiple write regions are enabled, the SDK will route write operations to available writable regions based on their PreferredRegions order, ensuring data consistency across all regions.              However, it''s important to note that setting this property value to true has no effect unless the EnableMultipleWriteRegions in DatabaseAccount is also set to true. In other words, you must enable multiple write regions at both the account and component levels for it to work effectively.              In some cases, you might need to set "multipleWriteRegionsEnabled" to false. This could be necessary when you want to disable writes across multiple regions intentionally, such as during maintenance operations or for specific data isolation requirements. But remember, disabling this option may impact the consistency and availability of your data across different geographical locations. Always ensure that any changes made align with your specific use case and data management strategy.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "preferredRegions" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and how can we set it to prefer operations being performed in the East US region when using a geo-replicated database account?'
      answer: |
       'The "preferredRegions" option in the Azure Cosmos DB component for Apache Camel allows you to specify one or more preferred regions for your geo-replicated database accounts. By setting this option, you can influence the SDK to prefer using the specified regions when performing operations on the container.              To set it up to prefer operations being performed in the East US region when using a geo-replicated database account, you should specify "East US" (or "East US", if you want to ensure that both regions are treated equally) as the preferred region(s). This can be achieved by configuring the "preferredRegions" property in your Camel context or route configuration with a string value of either "East US" or "East US, East US".'
    - question: 'How does the readRequestsFallbackEnabled option in the Apache Camel component for Azure Cosmos DB behave when both endpointDiscoveryEnabled is true and the Azure Cosmos DB account has multiple regions configured?'
      answer: |
       'When the `readRequestsFallbackEnabled` option in the Apache Camel component for Azure Cosmos DB is set to its default value (true) and both `endpointDiscoveryEnabled` is true and the Azure Cosmos DB account has multiple regions configured, reads will be permitted to go to multiple regions within the account. However, it''s important to note that this behavior varies depending on the consistency level selected. For all consistency levels other than Bounded Staleness, the default value of `readRequestsFallbackEnabled` is true. But for the Bounded Staleness consistency level, the default value is false. In summary, when both conditions (`endpointDiscoveryEnabled = true` and multiple regions configured) are met, reads will be allowed to go to multiple regions within the Azure Cosmos DB account, except in cases of Bounded Staleness consistency level where the default behavior is for reads not to fallback to other regions.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "throughputProperties" option in the Apache Camel component for Azure Cosmos DB, and is it required to be set when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "throughputProperties" option in the Apache Camel component for Azure Cosmos DB sets the throughput (request units per second) of the resources within the Azure Cosmos DB service. It''s important to note that this option has a default value of null. Therefore, setting the throughput properties is not required but can be specified if you wish to control the resource''s throughput when using the Azure Cosmos DB component in Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What are the default values for the configuration options of the changeFeedProcessorOptions in the Apache Camel Azure Cosmos DB component, if not explicitly set? And are these options required or optional when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default values for the configuration options of the changeFeedProcessorOptions in the Apache Camel Azure Cosmos DB component are as follows: maximum items per page or FeedResponse is 100, lease renew interval is 17 seconds, lease acquire interval is 13 seconds, lease expiration interval is 60 seconds, feed poll delay is 5 seconds, and maximum scale count is unlimited. These options are optional when using this component.'
    - question: 'In relation to using the Apache Camel component Azure-CosmosDB, when should the "createLeaseContainerIfNotExists" option be set to true for the creation of a lease container for consumers if it does not already exist in the Cosmos database?'
      answer: |
       'If you''re using the Apache Camel component Azure-CosmosDB, you should set the "createLeaseContainerIfNotExists" option to true when you want the component to automatically create a lease container for consumers in case it doesn''t already exist within your Cosmos database. This option is optional and its default value is false.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the "createLeaseDatabaseIfNotExists" option when using the Azure Cosmos DB component with Apache Camel, and can this option be configured to automatically create a lease database if it does not exist in the specified Cosmos account?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "createLeaseDatabaseIfNotExists" option is false when using the Azure Cosmos DB component with Apache Camel. However, you can configure this option to automatically create a lease database if it does not exist in your specified Cosmos account by setting its value to true.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "hostName" option within the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and is it required when using this component? Additionally, can you explain the relationship between the hostName and the change feed processor in the context of this component?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of the Azure Cosmos DB component within Apache Camel, the "hostName" option is used to set the hostname for an application instance that utilizes the change feed processor. This host serves as a listening point for changes within your Cosmos DB, allowing multiple instances with similar lease configurations to run concurrently. However, each instance should have a unique name. If not specified explicitly, a random hostname will be generated automatically. The relationship between the hostName and the change feed processor in this context is that the hostname identifies each application instance that listens for changes using the change feed processor within your Cosmos DB. This allows you to scale your changes processing horizontally by running multiple instances for improved performance, while ensuring that no two instances have the same name. The "hostName" option is not a required setting in this component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "leaseContainerName" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and what are the possible configurations for this option, including the default value and whether it''s required? Additionally, could you explain when and why this option might need to be set to a container stored outside the same account as the monitored container?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", the "leaseContainerName" option serves a crucial role in managing change feed processing across multiple workers. This lease container acts as state storage, helping to coordinate changes and ensuring data consistency. It can be created either within the same account as the monitored container or in a separate account. By default, it is named "camel-lease".              The necessity to set this option to a container stored outside the same account may arise when scalability is a concern. For instance, if you have multiple Cosmos DB accounts for different workloads, you might choose to store the lease container in a separate account to isolate these resources and optimize performance based on specific access patterns or resource consumption requirements. However, it''s essential to note that this option is not required; setting "createLeaseContainerIfNotExists" to true will automatically create the lease container if it doesn''t exist.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "leaseDatabaseName" option when using the Azure Cosmos DB component in Apache Camel, and under what circumstances will it automatically be created if not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The "leaseDatabaseName" option in the Azure Cosmos DB component for Apache Camel serves to specify the lease database where the lease container will be stored. If you do not provide this value, the component will store the lease container in the same database that is specified in "databaseName." This database will automatically be created if "createLeaseDatabaseIfNotExists" is set to true.'
    - question: 'How does the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel component azure-cosmosdb function, and what are the differences between using it and relying on the default ExceptionHandler for handling exceptions that occur while consuming messages from Cosmos DB?'
      answer: |
       'The `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Azure Cosmos DB component of Apache Camel enables bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions that may occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.              In contrast, the default ExceptionHandler simply logs exceptions at WARN or ERROR level and ignores them. The primary difference lies in how exceptions are handled: using the `bridgeErrorHandler` allows for more customized error handling, treating exceptions as messages to be processed, while relying on the default ExceptionHandler generally results in logging and ignoring exceptions.              However, it is important to note that not all 3rd party components support this behavior; some handle exceptions internally only, making the `bridgeErrorHandler` unavailable. Additionally, future releases may improve Camel components to hook into third-party components and make this possible for more components.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the exceptionHandler option in the Apache Camel azure-cosmosdb component, and can it be used if the bridgeErrorHandler is enabled? Also, what happens to exceptions when this option is not in use or its default value is applied?'
      answer: |
       'The `exceptionHandler` option in the Azure CosmosDB component of Apache Camel allows a user to implement a custom ExceptionHandler. However, if the `bridgeErrorHandler` is enabled, the `exceptionHandler` will not be utilized. By default, the consumer handles exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored when this option is not in use or its default value is applied. The consumer''s behavior with exceptions can be customized using the `exceptionHandler` option for advanced usage scenarios.'
    - question: 'What is the default value of the "exchangePattern" option within the "azure-cosmosdb" component in Apache Camel, and why is it considered an advanced group option under the "consumer" group?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "exchangePattern" option within the "azure-cosmosdb" component in Apache Camel is null. This option sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange, which is a concept from the Advanced Messaging model. It''s considered an advanced group option under the "consumer" group because it provides more specialized and less frequently used features to fine-tune the behavior of the consumer when interacting with the messaging broker.'

    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Azure Cosmos DB component of Apache Camel affect the behavior of a Camel route during startup, and what are its potential impacts on the overall processing time?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Azure Cosmos DB component of Apache Camel allows your route to defer the startup of the producer until the first message is processed. This can be useful when a producer might otherwise fail during the initial startup, causing the entire route to fail. Instead, any startup failure can be handled by Camel''s routing error handlers.              However, it''s important to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time compared to a non-lazy setup, which could potentially prolong the overall processing time of your route. This is because the lazy start approach defers the producer initialization until data processing begins. While this can help ensure a smoother startup process, it''s essential to consider the potential impact on performance and adjust accordingly based on the specific requirements of your application.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior for setting an Indexing Policy in an Azure Cosmos DB container when using Apache Camel''s azure-cosmosdb component, and can it be configured if the createLeaseContainerIfNotExists option is set to true?'
