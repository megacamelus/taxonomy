    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "clientTelemetryEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" and what is its default value, data type, and whether it is required?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientTelemetryEnabled" option in the Azure Cosmos DB component for Apache Camel is designed to control the collection of periodic database operations statistics, system information like CPU/Memory, and send these aggregates to the Cosmos Monitoring service. This can be extremely helpful during troubleshooting as it provides insights about the performance of your database operations. By default, this option is set to false (opt-out), meaning telemetry collection is not enabled. Its data type is boolean, and it''s an optional configuration parameter that belongs to the common group of settings.'
    - question: 'What are the possible configurations for the Apache Camel component Azure Cosmos DB, if I decide not to use a default value and instead provide custom settings?'
      answer: |
       'If you decide not to use the default value for the Apache Camel component Azure Cosmos DB and wish to provide your own configuration, possible custom settings could be found under the "configuration" option as specified in the given information. The type of these configurations is an object, meaning they can consist of multiple key-value pairs. Since the "required" field is false, you may or may not choose to include these configurations; however, they are grouped under "common", suggesting these settings are frequently used. You can refer to Azure Cosmos DB''s Camel component documentation for a comprehensive list and descriptions of the available configuration keys to fine-tune the behavior of this integration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "connectionSharingAcrossClientsEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and what happens to the connection configuration when this option is set?'
      answer: |
       'The "connectionSharingAcrossClientsEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" is designed to facilitate the sharing of connections across multiple Cosmos Client instances within the same Java Virtual Machine (JVM). When you have several Cosmos Client instances communicating with different Cosmos accounts, enabling this option allows connection sharing if possible between those instances in Direct mode.              By default, this option is set to false. However, when enabled, it uses the connection configuration (such as socket and idle timeouts) of the first instantiated client for all subsequent client instances. This means that any changes made to the connection configurations of subsequent clients will not be reflected; instead, they will all adopt the settings from the initial client. Please consider this implication when using this option in your applications.'
    - question: 'What are the available consistency levels that can be set using the `consistencyLevel` option in the Apache Camel `azure-cosmosdb` component, and what is their order of strength from strongest to weakest? Also, what is the default value for this option, if it''s not specified by the user?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel `azure-cosmosdb` component, the available consistency levels that can be set using the `consistencyLevel` option are STRONG, BOUNDED_STALENESS, SESSION, and EVENTUAL. These levels are ordered from strongest to weakest as follows: STRONG, BOUNDED_STALENESS, SESSION, and finally EVENTUAL. The default value for this option, if it''s not specified by the user, is SESSION. For more detailed information about these consistency levels, please refer to the documentation at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "containerPartitionKeyPath" option in the Apache Camel component for Azure Cosmos DB and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "containerPartitionKeyPath" option within the Apache Camel component for Azure Cosmos DB serves to specify the partition key path for the container (a collection of items in Azure Cosmos DB). This is useful for partitioning data across regions and improving performance at scale. However, providing a value for this option is not mandatory; it''s an optional setting that you can use if needed, grouped under common configuration settings.'
    - question: 'What is the recommended setting for the "contentResponseOnWriteEnabled" option in an Apache Camel route producer that uses the azure-cosmosdb component, and why should it be set differently in a consumer?'
      answer: |
       'In an Apache Camel route producing data to Azure Cosmos DB, it''s recommended to disable the "contentResponseOnWriteEnabled" option. This setting is designed to only return headers and status code instead of full content in Create, Update, and Delete operations on CosmosItem. By disabling this flag, you can minimize network overhead when acting as a producer.              In contrast, for a consumer using the same Azure Cosmos DB component, the "contentResponseOnWriteEnabled" option is enabled by default due to the ChangeFeed in the consumer that necessitates this flag to be enabled. In such cases, it''s generally unnecessary and possibly detrimental to override this setting.'
    - question: 'How should I configure or provide an instance of `cosmosAsyncClient` option in the Apache Camel component `azure-cosmosdb`, if I wish to use an asynchronous client for Azure Cosmos DB service, and is it mandatory to supply this option? (Is it optional or does it have a default value?)'
      answer: |
       'To utilize an asynchronous client for the Azure Cosmos DB service within the Apache Camel component `azure-cosmosdb`, you should configure or provide an instance of the `cosmosAsyncClient` option. This option allows you to inject an external `CosmosAsyncClient` object, which provides a client-side representation of the Azure Cosmos DB service. It''s important to note that supplying this option is optional; it does not have a default value. You can find more information about its group and usage in the "common" section of your component''s configuration details.'
    - question: 'Can you explain the functionality of the "createContainerIfNotExists" option within the Apache Camel component for Azure Cosmos DB, and tell me whether this feature is activated by default when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "createContainerIfNotExists" option within the Apache Camel component for Azure Cosmos DB allows you to set whether the component should create a Cosmos container automatically in case it doesn''t exist in the Cosmos database. This feature is not activated by default when using this component, as indicated by its default value of false. You can modify this behavior depending on your specific use case, and find it under the "common" group of settings for easy accessibility.'
    - question: 'Can you explain what happens when the boolean option "createDatabaseIfNotExists" within the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" is set to true? Does it automatically create a Cosmos database in the specified Cosmos account if it does not already exist? (Assuming default value is false)'
      answer: |
       'When the boolean option "createDatabaseIfNotExists" within the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" is set to true, it indicates that the component will automatically create a Cosmos database in the specified Cosmos account if the said database does not already exist. However, when its default value (false) is used, no database will be created.'
    - question: 'What is the mandatory string input parameter required in the Apache Camel component azure-cosmosdb when configuring a connection to an Azure Cosmos database, and what purpose does it serve?'
      answer: |
       'The mandatory string input parameter needed when configuring a connection to an Azure Cosmos database using the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" is called "databaseEndpoint". This parameter sets the endpoint for your Azure Cosmos database that the component will connect to. In other words, it specifies the location of the Azure Cosmos DB instance in your Microsoft Azure account, enabling the component to establish a connection with it for further operations.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "multipleWriteRegionsEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and when should this property be set to false instead of its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "multipleWriteRegionsEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" is a boolean property, with a default value of true. Its purpose is to enable writes on any regions for geo-replicated database accounts in Azure Cosmos DB. When this property is set to true, your SDK will route write operations to writable regions of your geo-replicated database account in the order specified by the PreferredRegions property.              However, you should set this property to false only when you want to disable multi-region writes and restrict write operations to a specific region. This may be necessary if your application requirements prioritize maintaining data consistency within a single region over potential latency benefits of geo-replication. Keep in mind that changing the default value requires that you also adjust the EnableMultipleWriteRegions setting at the DatabaseAccount level.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "preferredRegions" option within the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and what values can be set for this option when configuring a geo-replicated Cosmos DB account, considering that the SDK will prefer to use the specified regions in the order they are provided when performing operations?'
      answer: |
       'The "preferredRegions" option within the Azure Cosmos DB component for Apache Camel allows you to specify a comma-separated list of preferred geographical regions for your geo-replicated Cosmos DB account. For instance, you might set East US as the preferred region. When the EnableEndpointDiscovery is enabled and PreferredRegions is non-empty, the SDK will prioritize using the regions listed in the order they are provided when executing operations. Keep in mind that this option is not mandatory; it''s available under the ''common'' configuration group.'
    - question: 'What is the default value of the `readRequestsFallbackEnabled` option in the Apache Camel component for Azure Cosmos DB when using consistency level other than Bounded Staleness, and when endpointDiscoveryEnabled is set to true and the Azure Cosmos DB account has more than one region? Is this default value configurable?'
      answer: |
       'The default value of the `readRequestsFallbackEnabled` option in the Apache Camel component for Azure Cosmos DB, when using consistency level other than Bounded Staleness, is set to true, assuming endpointDiscoveryEnabled is set to true and the Azure Cosmos DB account has more than one region. This default value can be configured if needed.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the option "throughputProperties" within the Apache Camel component named "azure-cosmosdb"? Also, is it optional and if so, what data type should be provided when using this option?'
      answer: |
       'The option "throughputProperties" within the Azure Cosmos DB component (`azure-cosmosdb`) in Apache Camel is designed to set the throughput of the resources in the Azure Cosmos DB service. The default value for this option is `null`. It''s an optional configuration, meaning you can choose whether or not to provide it when using this component. If used, the data type that should be provided is an "object".'
    - question: 'Given the information provided about the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" option "bridgeErrorHandler", here''s a question you could ask:              "How can I configure the ''azure-cosmosdb'' component in Apache Camel to bridge exceptions from the consumer to its routing Error Handler using the ''bridgeErrorHandler'' option, and what is the default setting for this option?"'
      answer: |
       'To configure the ''azure-cosmosdb'' component in Apache Camel to bridge exceptions from the consumer to its routing Error Handler, you can set the "bridgeErrorHandler" option to true. By default, this option is set to false, so if you want to use the bridging feature, make sure to explicitly set it to true. This option works only when the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown; otherwise, it will continue using the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to handle exceptions by default.'
    - question: 'What are the default values for the "maximum items per page" and "lease renew interval", as well as whether these values can be set if not provided explicitly, when using the "changeFeedProcessorOptions" option with the Azure Cosmos DB component in Apache Camel?'
      answer: |
       'When utilizing the "changeFeedProcessorOptions" option with the Azure Cosmos DB component in Apache Camel, the default values for "maximum items per page" (FeedResponse) and "lease renew interval" are 100 and 17 seconds respectively. These values can be set if not provided explicitly, as the library will automatically use these default values if no custom options are specified.'
    - question: 'How is the behavior of the Apache Camel azure-cosmosdb component with regard to creating a Cosmos DB lease container if it does not already exist, given that the default value for the "createLeaseContainerIfNotExists" option is false? Is it possible to make this operation automatic by changing the configuration of this option?'
      answer: |
       'The behavior of the Apache Camel azure-cosmosdb component in regard to creating a Cosmos DB lease container is controlled by the "createLeaseContainerIfNotExists" option. By default, this option is set to false, meaning that if a lease container doesn''t already exist in your Cosmos database, it will not be created automatically when you use this component. However, you can make this operation automatic by changing the configuration of this option to true. This allows your component to create the lease container for you in case it doesn''t exist, facilitating smooth operation.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior when using the "createLeaseDatabaseIfNotExists" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and can this option be set to automatically create a Cosmos lease database for the consumer if it doesn''t already exist?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior when using the "createLeaseDatabaseIfNotExists" option in the Azure Cosmos DB component of Apache Camel is that it does not create the Cosmos lease database automatically for the consumer, as its default value is false. However, if you want to set it up so that a Cosmos lease database is created for the consumer if it doesn''t already exist within your Cosmos account, you can change the "createLeaseDatabaseIfNotExists" option to true in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "hostName" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of the Azure Cosmos DB component within Apache Camel, the "hostName" option sets the application instance name that uses the change feed processor to listen for changes in the database. It''s not mandatory to specify this value; if not provided, a random hostname will be generated instead. The purpose of the hostName is to allow multiple instances with the same lease configuration to run in parallel while ensuring each instance has a unique identifier (instance name). This feature is particularly useful under the "consumer" group settings.'
    - question: 'What should be the default value, and what purpose does the "leaseContainerName" option serve within the context of the Apache Camel''s Azure CosmosDB component, when it comes to setting a container that manages state storage and coordinating processing of change feed across multiple workers? Furthermore, is this lease container required, and if not created automatically, what condition triggers its creation? Finally, where can this lease container be located in relation to the monitored Cosmos DB account or another account?'
      answer: |
       'The "leaseContainerName" option within Apache Camel''s Azure CosmosDB component is responsible for setting a lease container that acts as a state storage and coordinates processing of the change feed across multiple workers. Its default value is "camel-lease". This container can be stored in either the same account as the monitored container or in a separate account. If you''d like the lease container to be auto created if it doesn''t exist, set createLeaseContainerIfNotExists to true. This container is not required but will be automatically created under the specified conditions.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "leaseDatabaseName" option within the Apache Camel''s Azure Cosmos DB component and when is it required to specify its value? Furthermore, explain the consequences if this value is not provided in relation to where the lease container will be stored.'
      answer: |
       'In the context of the Apache Camel''s Azure Cosmos DB component, the "leaseDatabaseName" option determines where the lease container associated with your operation will be stored. If you choose not to specify this value, the component will default to using the same database as the one specified in "databaseName." However, if a separate lease database is required for any reason, it can be explicitly set via the "leaseDatabaseName" option.              If "createLeaseDatabaseIfNotExists" is set to true, the lease database will be automatically created when it doesn''t already exist. Without specifying a "leaseDatabaseName", it''s essential to keep in mind that the component may create an additional database for storing your leases, which could potentially impact performance and resource utilization depending on your application''s scale and complexity. Therefore, providing this value can help better manage resources and optimize the overall system efficiency.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of using the "itemId" option in the Apache Camel Azure CosmosDB component, and is it required or optional when performing operations such as deletion or replacement on an item?'
      answer: |
       'The "itemId" option in the Apache Camel Azure CosmosDB component is intended for setting a unique identifier (ID) for an item during operations like deletion or replacement. While its use is not required, it can be useful to ensure that the correct item is targeted for specific actions. In case you wish to specify an "itemId," you may do so; otherwise, the option will default to null.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of using the "itemPartitionKey" option within the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and how can it be set or configured, as well as whether its usage is required?'
      answer: |
       'The "itemPartitionKey" option in the Azure Cosmos DB component for Apache Camel serves to set a partition key value. A partition key identifies the partition where an item (document) is stored within the Azure Cosmos DB database service. While its usage isn''t required, setting it allows optimal distribution of data and better performance as your data grows. You can set or configure "itemPartitionKey" by providing a string that uniquely represents the data in your documents, following the guidelines for partition key choice in Azure Cosmos DB. This configuration belongs to the ''producer'' group within Camel routing components.'
    - question: 'In the context of the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", what does the option "lazyStartProducer" do, why would it be useful to configure it to true or false, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'In the Azure Cosmos DB component for Apache Camel, the option "lazyStartProducer" allows you to defer the starting of the producer until the first message is processed. This can be beneficial in scenarios where the producer might fail during the startup of the route, preventing it from being started. By setting this option to true and allowing lazy start, the initial failure during starting can be handled via Camel''s routing error handlers instead.              However, there''s a trade-off: since the creating and starting of the producer will take place only upon processing the first message, it may prolong the total processing time for that specific message.              It is worth noting that the default value for this option is false (the producer starts immediately during CamelContext or route startup). Whether to configure "lazyStartProducer" as true or false depends on your particular use case and requirements concerning error handling, processing time, and overall system behavior.'
    - question: 'What is the default Cosmos DB operation that can be specified for the Apache Camel''s azure-cosmosdb component when configuring it as a producer to perform an action, and is this setting optional?'
      answer: |
       'The default Cosmos DB operation that can be specified for Apache Camel''s azure-cosmosdb component when used as a producer is "listDatabases". This setting is optional, meaning you may provide another operation if desired, but using the default value will result in listing databases within your Cosmos DB.'
    - question: 'What is the syntax and structure of the SQL query that can be used with the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" option named "query"? Is there any default value for this option, and can it be specified as optional? Additionally, where can I find more information about Cosmos SQL API syntax and usage?'
      answer: |
       'The SQL query syntax and structure to execute on an Azure Cosmos DB resource using the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" option named "query" is flexible and adheres to Cosmos SQL API standards, providing a powerful and easy-to-use method for querying data. This option is not mandatory (required: false) and it does not have a default value. For comprehensive guidance on the Cosmos SQL API syntax and usage, please visit this link: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql-query-getting-started>              This guide will provide you with an introduction to SQL queries using the Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB, SQL, Gremlin, and Apache Spark (Cosmos Graph). It covers basic query concepts, sample scenarios, and troubleshooting techniques to help you get up-and-running efficiently.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "queryRequestOptions" option in the Apache Camel Azure CosmosDB component, and can it be configured as a required or optional parameter for various operations such as queryItems, queryContainers, queryDatabases, listDatabases, listItems, listContainers?'
      answer: |
       'The "queryRequestOptions" option in the Apache Camel Azure CosmosDB component serves to set additional QueryRequestOptions that can be utilized with queryItems, queryContainers, queryDatabases, listDatabases, listItems, and listContainers operations. By default, it has no value ("defaultValue": null). It''s an optional parameter, which means you can choose to configure or omit its use depending on your specific requirements. The group of options that this option belongs to is "producer".'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "indexingPolicy" option in the Apache Camel Azure CosmosDB component, and is it required when creating a lease container if it does not exist? Additionally, where does this indexing policy setting fit within the Apache Camel advanced group of options?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "indexingPolicy" option in the Apache Camel Azure CosmosDB component is null. This option is related to createLeaseContainerIfNotExists and it will be taken into account when the latter is true. However, the usage of indexingPolicy when creating a lease container if it does not exist is optional. It belongs to the advanced group of options within Apache Camel settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel''s Azure Cosmos DB component, and can it be used obligatorily? Furthermore, describe the function of this option with an example scenario.'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in Apache Camel''s Azure Cosmos DB component is a boolean parameter that determines whether autowiring is enabled for automatic configuration. By default, it is set to true, meaning that autowiring is active. This feature allows for automatic lookup of single instances in the registry based on type match, which are then configured on the component. This can be useful for auto-configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, or in this case, Azure Cosmos DB resources.              In an example scenario, if you have multiple Azure Cosmos DB instances of the same type registered in your application''s registry, and "autowiredEnabled" is set to true for the component, Camel will automatically choose one instance for your component during configuration, sparing you from manual configuration for each individual instance. If this feature isn''t needed, it can be disabled by setting "autowiredEnabled" to false. It falls under the advanced configuration group and is not mandatory to use.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, and requirement (if any) of the "accountKey" option within the Apache Camel component called "azure-cosmosdb", and under which group this configuration option can be found in terms of security-related settings?'
      answer: |
       'The "accountKey" option within the Azure Cosmos DB component for Apache Camel is a configurable setting that either provides a master or readonly key used to authenticate access to your Cosmos DB resource. Its default value is null, meaning no key is set by default. This option is not required in the configuration but falls under the security group due to its role in granting access to sensitive data. You can locate this security-related setting within the broader scope of Azure Cosmos DB settings when configuring your Camel routes.'
    - question: 'What are the valid options for the `credentialType` option within the Apache Camel `azure-cosmosdb` component, and what is the default value if no explicit value is provided? Also, could you explain the purpose of the `credentialType` option in terms of security within this context?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the Azure Cosmos DB component in Apache Camel, the `credentialType` option determines the strategy for providing credentials, serving as a means to enhance security by enabling flexible authentication methods. The valid options for `credentialType` are: SHARED_ACCOUNT_KEY (the default), OAuth2, Managed Identity, and UsernamePassword. If no explicit value is provided, the default value is SHARED_ACCOUNT_KEY, meaning that authentication will occur using the Azure Cosmos DB account key directly. It''s essential to understand the importance of the `credentialType` option in ensuring secure data access by providing a way to manage and control how your application authenticates with the Azure Cosmos DB service.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the `clientTelemetryEnabled` option in the Apache Camel component `azure-cosmosdb`, and what function does it serve when enabled?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `clientTelemetryEnabled` option in the Apache Camel component `azure-cosmosdb` is false, indicating that this is an opt-in feature for telemetry collection. When enabled, client telemetry will periodically collect database operations aggregation statistics, as well as system information like CPU/memory, and send it to the Cosmos Monitoring Service. This can be helpful during debugging processes.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "connectionSharingAcrossClientsEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component Azure CosmosDB influence the behavior and configuration of multiple instances of Cosmos Clients within a JVM, specifically regarding connection sharing and configuration settings when using Direct mode?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "connectionSharingAcrossClientsEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component for Azure CosmosDB facilitates connections sharing between multiple instances of Cosmos Clients within the same JVM, provided they are interacting with multiple Cosmos accounts in Direct mode. When you choose to activate this setting, a single connection configuration, which includes socket and idle timeouts, will be utilized across all other client instances. This means that the configuration settings of the first instantiated client, such as the specified timeout values, will apply to all subsequent client instances interacting with Azure CosmosDB in Direct mode.'
    - question: 'What are the valid values for the Azure CosmosDB consistencyLevel option in Apache Camel''s azure-cosmosdb component and what is the default value, as well as a brief description of each level in order from strongest to weakest? (Refer to this documentation: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels>)'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s azure-cosmosdb component, the valid values for the consistencyLevel option are STRONG, BOUNDED_STALENESS, SESSION, and EVENTUAL. These levels indicate the degree of data consistency provided by Azure Cosmos DB, with STRONG being the strongest (guaranteeing that every read receives the most recent write) and EVENTUAL being the weakest (data may be inconsistent for a time as the system eventually becomes consistent). The default value is SESSION, meaning that within a single session (transaction), data reads and writes will have strong consistency. You can find more detailed information about these levels in the Azure Cosmos DB Consistency Levels documentation at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "containerPartitionKeyPath" option within the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and is it optional to set a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "containerPartitionKeyPath" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" serves the purpose of setting the container''s partition key path, which helps in data distribution within Cosmos DB. By default, it has no predefined value (i.e., null). It is not compulsory to provide a value for this option, as it can be skipped if the container uses the system-generated partitioning.'
    - question: 'How does the `contentResponseOnWriteEnabled` option in the Apache Camel component for Azure Cosmos DB behave differently when used in a producer compared to a consumer, and why is it important to consider its default value in each scenario?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of an Azure Cosmos DB operation with the Apache Camel component, `contentResponseOnWriteEnabled` behaves differently when used in a Producer versus a Consumer. By default, this option is set to true for a Consumer because of its role in managing the ChangeFeed, which necessitates enabling this flag. Conversely, it''s advisable to disable it when using it as a Producer since disabling this option reduces network overhead by only returning headers and status code, thereby optimizing data transmission. Considering the default value accordingly ensures efficient communication between your Cosmos DB consumer and producer.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "cosmosAsyncClient" option in the Apache Camel component named "azure-cosmosdb", and how can it be configured or provided if not set by default?'
      answer: |
       'The "cosmosAsyncClient" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" is intended to inject an external instance of `CosmosAsyncClient`. This client represents your connection to Azure Cosmos DB service asynchronously, enabling you to configure and execute requests against it. If not provided by default, you can set it up at configuration time, providing a properly instantiated `CosmosAsyncClient`.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and the usage of the "createContainerIfNotExists" option within the Apache Camel Azure CosmosDB component?'
      answer: |
       'The "createContainerIfNotExists" option in the Apache Camel Azure CosmosDB component is set to a boolean default value of false. This option determines if the component should create a Cosmos container automatically in the database, provided that it doesn''t exist. While not required for use, setting this option to true can help ensure data is consistently written into a predefined Cosmos container within the Azure CosmosDB service.'
    - question: 'What is the default value of the option ''createDatabaseIfNotExists'' within the Apache Camel component ''azure-cosmosdb'', and is it required for use with this component? Also, what data type does this option expect and under which group can this option be found in the configuration settings of the ''azure-cosmosdb'' component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value of the ''createDatabaseIfNotExists'' option within the Apache Camel component ''azure-cosmosdb'' is false, meaning the Cosmos database will not be created automatically if it doesn''t exist in your Cosmos account. This option is not required for use with this component as you can still perform operations on an existing Cosmos database. The data type expected by this option is boolean, and it can be found under the ''common'' group in the configuration settings of the ''azure-cosmosdb'' component.'
    - question: 'What should be the data type, whether it''s mandatory (required), and the purpose of the "databaseEndpoint" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb"?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseEndpoint" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" is a mandatory ("required": true) string data type ("type":"string"). Its purpose is to set the Azure Cosmos database endpoint that the component will connect to during runtime (" Sets the Azure Cosmos database endpoint the component will connect to."). This information falls under the common group of settings in the configuration ("groups":"common").'
    - question: 'How does setting the option "multipleWriteRegionsEnabled" to `true` in an Apache Camel component for Azure Cosmos DB affect write operations when using a geo-replicated database account? Also, what is the default value for this option and under what conditions does this option take effect?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the option "multipleWriteRegionsEnabled" to `true` in an Apache Camel component for Azure Cosmos DB allows write operations to be directed to available writable regions of a geo-replicated database account. When multipleWriteRegionsEnabled is true, it considers the PreferredRegions property while determining the writable regions. However, this option only takes effect if EnableMultipleWriteRegions in DatabaseAccount is also set to true. The default value for the "multipleWriteRegionsEnabled" option is `true`, meaning that writes will be directed to available writable regions of a geo-replicated database account by default.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of setting preferredRegions option in Apache Camel''s azure-cosmosdb component, and what value type does it accept, as well as its default value and whether it is required or not?'
      answer: |
       'The "preferredRegions" option in Apache Camel''s Azure Cosmos DB component sets a comma-separated list of preferred regions for your geo-replicated database accounts. For instance, you could specify "East US" as your preferred region. When the EnableEndpointDiscovery is enabled and PreferredRegions is not empty, the SDK will favor using these specified regions in the order they are provided to execute operations. The data type for this option is a string, and it does not have a default value. You can choose whether or not to include it, as its usage is optional.'
    - question: 'In a scenario where you have an Apache Camel route using the azure-cosmosdb component and your Azure Cosmos DB account is configured to work across multiple regions, would setting `readRequestsFallbackEnabled` to `false` affect the consistency level of reads when `endpointDiscoveryEnabled` is true? Given that the default value of `readRequestsFallbackEnabled` is `true` for all Consistency Levels other than Bounded Staleness (where its default value is `false`), and assuming your current endpoint discovery is enabled.'
      answer: |
       'In a scenario where you have an Apache Camel route using the azure-cosmosdb component and your Azure Cosmos DB account is configured to work across multiple regions, setting `readRequestsFallbackEnabled` to `false` will not affect the consistency level of reads when `endpointDiscoveryEnabled` is true, except for Bounded Staleness. For all other Consistency Levels (including the default), the `readRequestsFallbackEnabled` property has a DEFAULT value of true. However, for Bounded Staleness, the default value of this property is false. Therefore, it''s important to consider that setting readRequestsFallbackEnabled to false explicitly can potentially affect consistency levels when working with Bounded Staleness.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value, if any, for the option "throughputProperties" in the Apache Camel component named "azure-cosmosdb", and is it required when using this component? Also, what type of data can be provided to configure this option, and where does the concept of "groups" fit into this configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The option "throughputProperties" in the Apache Camel component named "azure-cosmosdb" is designed to set the throughput of resources within the Azure Cosmos DB service. This value, by default, does not have a specific default (indicated by `defaultValue: null`). Whether or not you need to provide this option when using the "azure-cosmosdb" component is optional, as it is marked as "required: false".              Regarding the type of data that can be configured for this option, it''s an "object", which generally means a set of key-value pairs in JSON or scripting languages.              Finally, the concept of "groups" fits into this configuration within the broader context, as indicated by `"groups":"common"`. This suggests that "throughputProperties" is part of a collection of options that fall under a category or group named "common", possibly for ease of organization and understanding within the component''s configuration settings.'
    - question: 'What are the default values for the option "changeFeedProcessorOptions" in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and can it accept a null value? Furthermore, where can these options be found under the given description?'
      answer: |
       'The default values for the option "changeFeedProcessorOptions" in the Azure Cosmos DB component of Apache Camel are: maximum items per page (in FeedResponse) - 100, lease renew interval - 17 seconds, lease acquire interval - 13 seconds, lease expiration interval - 60 seconds, feed poll delay - 5 seconds, maximum scale count - unlimited. It can accept a null value as the option is marked as "required: false". The given options fall under the "consumer" group of settings in the component configuration.'
    - question: '"What is the default behavior of the ''createLeaseContainerIfNotExists'' option in the Azure Cosmos DB component for Apache Camel when used with a consumer, and how can it be configured to automatically create a lease container if it does not exist in the Cosmos database?"'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the ''createLeaseContainerIfNotExists'' option in the Azure Cosmos DB component for Apache Camel, when used with a consumer, is set to false, meaning the component will not create a lease container automatically if it does not exist in the Cosmos database. To configure it to automatically create a lease container if it does not exist, you can set the ''createLeaseContainerIfNotExists'' option to true. This can be useful when you want to ensure that the lease container is always available for your consumer to manage message ordering and fault tolerance.'
    - question: 'In regards to the Apache Camel''s azure-cosmosdb component, what is the default value and can it be set to create a lease database automatically if it does not exist on the Cosmos account for consumers that do not explicitly specify this option?'
      answer: |
       'The Azure Cosmos DB component in Apache Camel has an optional setting named "createLeaseDatabaseIfNotExists". This setting determines whether the component should create a lease database automatically within your Cosmos account if it doesn''t exist, specifically for consumers who do not explicitly specify this option. By default, this feature is disabled (set to false). However, you can choose to enable it by setting the value to true in your configuration, thereby ensuring the creation of a lease database automatically when needed.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "hostName" option within the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and what are its default and allowed data types, and is it required for configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "hostName" option within the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" serves to set the hostname of the application instance that uses the change feed processor to listen for changes in the Cosmos DB. This host can have multiple instances running in parallel with the same lease configuration, but each should have a distinct instance name. If no hostname is specified, one will be generated automatically. The "hostName" option accepts a string data type and it''s not required for configuring the component, but specifying it provides flexibility during deployment.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the leaseContainerName option in the Apache Camel component Azure CosmosDB, and can it be automatically created when not existing if createLeaseContainerIfNotExists is set to true? Additionally, what is the default value for leaseContainerName and is it required during configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "leaseContainerName" option in the Apache Camel component Azure CosmosDB serves as a state storage and helps coordinate processing of change feed across multiple workers. It can be located in the same account as the monitored container or a separate one. If you set "createLeaseContainerIfNotExists" to true, the lease container will be automatically created if it doesn''t exist already. The default value for "leaseContainerName" is "camel-lease", and while it''s not required, setting it during configuration is optional within the consumer group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of setting the `leaseDatabaseName` option in the Azure Cosmos DB component (azure-cosmosdb) within Apache Camel, and under what circumstances would it be required or auto-created?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `leaseDatabaseName` option in the Azure Cosmos DB component (azure-cosmosdb) within Apache Camel allows you to specify the lease database where a lease container will be stored for managing long-running operations like distributed transactions, conflict resolution, or retrying failed messages. If `leaseDatabaseName` is not specified, the component will store the lease container in the same database that is specified in `databaseName`. In case `createLeaseDatabaseIfNotExists` is set to true, it will automatically create a new lease database if none exists. This option may be required or auto-created under circumstances where you want to manage and handle long-running operations efficiently using Azure Cosmos DB in your Apache Camel applications.'
    - question: 'Can you explain when and why we would choose to enable the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel component for Azure Cosmos DB, and what are its implications compared to using the default exception handling mechanism?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel component for Azure Cosmos DB allows exceptions that occur while the consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages to be processed as messages instead, which can then be handled by the routing Error Handler. This provides a more structured way of managing errors compared to the default exception handling mechanism, where exceptions are logged and ignored. The main advantage of using this option is that it offers greater control over error handling and can make your application''s behavior more predictable in response to errors. However, it should be noted that this feature is not always possible for every 3rd-party component – only those that allow Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. Additionally, some components may handle exceptions internally and thus the "bridgeErrorHandler" option will not apply. If your application requires more sophisticated error handling for messages from Azure Cosmos DB, enabling this option could prove beneficial.'
    - question: 'Given the information provided about the Apache Camel component `azure-cosmosdb` option named `exceptionHandler`, here is a potential question:              "Could you explain how to configure a custom ExceptionHandler for the Apache Camel Azure Cosmos DB component when using it as a consumer? Also, if the `bridgeErrorHandler` option is enabled and an exception occurs in the component, what happens to that exception by default?"'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom ExceptionHandler for the Apache Camel Azure Cosmos DB component when using it as a consumer, you can set the "exceptionHandler" option within your component configuration. However, if the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled, this option will not be in use by default. By default, exceptions that occur at WARN or ERROR level will be logged and ignored by the consumer. If both options are used together, it''s important to note that the "exceptionHandler" configuration would take precedence over the global "bridgeErrorHandler" behavior.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "exchangePattern" option within the Apache Camel component for Azure Cosmos DB, and is it mandatory to set a value for this option when using the consumer in advanced configurations?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option within the Apache Camel component for Azure Cosmos DB does not have a default value. This setting determines the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange, which defines how messages are propagated among various components in an Enterprise Integration Pattern (EIP). Although it''s not mandatory to set a value for this option, it falls under the advanced group of configurations titled "consumer (advanced)". If you wish to customize the behavior of your Azure Cosmos DB consumer according to specific EIP scenarios, you may need to set an appropriate value for this option.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of setting the "itemId" option when using the Apache Camel component named "azure-cosmosdb", and is it required or optional in operations like delete or replace?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the Apache Camel component named "azure-cosmosdb", setting the "itemId" option enables you to specify an identity for a particular item during data operations such as delete or replace. This is entirely optional, meaning you''re not required to include it in your operations if desired, but it can be useful for precise management of items within Azure Cosmos DB.'
    - question: 'How should one configure the `itemPartitionKey` option in the Apache Camel Azure CosmosDB component to set a partition key for items being produced, if this configuration is optional and accepts a string value?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the `itemPartitionKey` option in the Apache Camel Azure CosmosDB component for setting a partition key for items being produced, you should provide a string value as this option accepts such values. However, note that the configuration of the partition key is optional. If you choose to set it, simply include the appropriate string representing your chosen partition key within the component''s configuration settings. This will help in identifying where the item will be stored in the Azure Cosmos DB database service.'
    - question: 'What is the default CosmosDB operation that can be specified for the Apache Camel `azure-cosmosdb` component when configuring a producer, if no specific operation is provided?'
      answer: |
       'The default CosmosDB operation that can be specified for the Apache Camel `azure-cosmosdb` component when configuring a producer, if no specific operation is provided, is `listDatabases`.'
    - question: 'What is the format and structure of the SQL query that can be used in the "query" option within the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", if provided, when using Cosmos DB? Can you provide an example of a simple SQL query to retrieve data from a specific collection or resource in Cosmos DB, and where can I find more detailed information about Cosmos DB SQL API queries?'
      answer: |
       'The "query" option within the Azure Cosmos DB component in Apache Camel accepts a string format representing an SQL query for your Cosmos DB resources. Here''s an example of a simple SQL query to retrieve data from a specific collection or resource:       ```       SELECT * FROM c where c.id = ''some-document-id''       ```       To learn more about Cosmos DB SQL API queries, please refer to this link: [Cosmos DB SQL API Getting Started](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql-query-getting-started)'
    - question: 'Can you explain the purpose and default value of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Azure Cosmos DB component within Apache Camel, and under what circumstances might it be beneficial to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Azure Cosmos DB component of Apache Camel is designed to control whether the producer should start lazily, on the first message instead of during initial startup. This option can be beneficial when the producer may fail during the starting phase, causing the entire route to fail. By deferring the startup of the producer to a lazy state, you can handle startup failures using Camel''s routing error handlers during the processing of messages rather than preventing the route from initializing altogether.              Please note that setting this option to true may cause an increase in total processing time when the first message is processed because creating and starting the producer takes some time. Therefore, it is recommended to set this option only when necessary, under the group "producer (advanced)".'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the "indexingPolicy" option for the Apache Camel Azure CosmosDB component if the container creation requires creating a LeaseContainer (i.e., when the `createLeaseContainerIfNotExists` is set to true), and is there a default value for this indexing policy?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s Azure CosmosDB component, if container creation necessitates creating a LeaseContainer (when `createLeaseContainerIfNotExists` is set to true), the default behavior of the "indexingPolicy" option for the CosmosDB component does not have a predefined value. This means that an explicit indexing policy must be provided when creating such a container if you wish to customize it. This option is classified under advanced settings in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and type of the option "accountKey" in the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and is it required when using this component? Also, is there a default value for this option, and which group does it belong to in terms of component''s configuration options?'
      answer: |
       'The "accountKey" option within the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb" serves as either a master or read-only key used for authentication to access your Cosmos DB resource. This option is not mandatory, as its usage is optional in the context of this component. It should be noted that there is no default value assigned to this option. In terms of grouping within the component''s configuration options, "accountKey" belongs to the "security" group.'
    - question: 'What are the different possible values for the "credentialType" option within the Apache Camel component "azure-cosmosdb", and what does it determine with regard to the credential strategy when using this component? Additionally, is it mandatory to specify a value for this option, and what is the default value if no value is provided?'
      answer: |
       'In the Azure CosmosDB component within Apache Camel, the "credentialType" option determines the strategy for adopting credentials when using this component. The possible values for this option are SHARED_ACCOUNT_KEY, AZURE_ACCESS_TOKEN, and OAuth2. If no value is specified, the default value is SHAREd_ACCount_KEY. It is not mandatory to specify a value for "credentialType", but it is recommended to do so to secure your CosmosDB access properly according to your application''s needs.'
