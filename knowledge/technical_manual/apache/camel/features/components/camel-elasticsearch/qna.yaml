seed_examples:
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the optional Apache Camel elasticsearch component''s connectionTimeout option, and under which group can it be configured?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional Apache Camel Elasticsearch component''s connectionTimeout option is an integer with a value of 30000 (milliseconds). This configuration can be found under the "producer" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "enableDocumentOnlyMode" option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component, and when should it be enabled during the migration from the legacy camel-elasticsearch-rest component for efficient handling of update operations?'
      answer: |
       'The "enableDocumentOnlyMode" option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component is used to specify whether the message body contains only documents. By default, it is set to false, which allows you to perform requests similar to what the Document API supports (refer to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs.html for more details).              During the migration from the legacy camel-elasticsearch-rest component, it is recommended to enable this mode, particularly if your routes involve update operations. Enabling this option can help streamline the handling of updates, making the migration process more efficient.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "hostAddresses" option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component, and what format should the values take when using it? Is it mandatory, and can you provide an example of its usage if a default value is not provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "hostAddresses" option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component allows you to specify a comma-separated list of remote transport addresses to be used for communication with an Elasticsearch cluster. Each address should be formatted as `ip:port`. If you do not provide specific IP and port values, leaving them blank will indicate that you want to use the `hostAddresses` value instead. It''s important to note that using this option is not mandatory, as the component can also connect to an Elasticsearch cluster without it by providing individual IP and port values for each connection attempt. If no default value is provided, you can set up the "hostAddresses" option with a list of remote transport addresses like this: `192.168.1.100:9300, 192.168.1.101:9300`.'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component''s "lazyStartProducer" option affect the behavior of a route, and why might it be beneficial to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProduver" option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component allows you to defer the startup of the producer until the first message is processed. This can be particularly useful when a producer may otherwise fail during startup, causing the entire route to fail as well. By setting this option to true, you enable the route to start successfully and handle any production-related failures using Camel''s routing error handlers.              However, it is essential to note that deferring the startup of the producer will slightly prolong the total processing time since creating and starting the producer when the first message is processed may take some additional time. This could be beneficial in scenarios where you want to prioritize the successful initialization of your route over immediate performance, while still having a mechanism in place to handle potential production-related issues gracefully.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the optional Apache Camel Elasticsearch component option "maxRetryTimeout", and what group does this option belong to in terms of its functionality (producer or consumer)?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional Apache Camel Elasticsearch component option "maxRetryTimeout" is an integer type with a value of 30000ms (or 30 seconds). This option belongs to the producer group in terms of its functionality, as it regulates the time before retrying when producing data.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the "socketTimeout" option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component, and is it required when configuring a producer?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "socketTimeout" option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component is an integer of 30000 milliseconds (or 30 seconds). It is not a required configuration when setting up a producer, as indicated by the "required": false property.'
    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component affect its behavior, and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component allows for automatic configuration of components like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc., by searching the registry to find a single instance of matching type. This feature is useful for simplifying complex configurations. If you disable this option, manual configuration would be required instead. The default value for this option is true, meaning that autowiring is enabled by default. However, it can be set to false if desired for specific use cases where manual configuration is preferred.'
    - question: 'How can I utilize an already configured Elasticsearch client in Apache Camel''s Elasticsearch component, and what are the benefits of doing so compared to creating a new client per endpoint? Additionally, how can I customize the client with specific settings if I choose to use an existing one?'
      answer: |
       'To utilize an already configured Elasticsearch client in Apache Camel''s Elasticsearch component, you can set the "client" option to your existing client instance. This option allows you to avoid creating a new client per endpoint, which provides benefits such as consistency across your application and the ability to customize the client with specific settings. For example, you may choose to set the client''s request timeout or maximum number of retries based on your use case requirements. To customize the client, simply pass an Elasticsearch client instance that has been configured with your desired settings before setting it as the value for the "client" option in the Camel configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the ''enableSniffer'' option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component, and under what circumstances should it be manually set to true instead of relying on Spring Boot configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The ''enableSniffer'' option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component is designed to automatically discover nodes from a running Elasticsearch cluster. Its default value is false, meaning that node discovery is disabled by default. However, if you wish to enable this feature, you should manually set its value to true instead of relying on Spring Boot configuration. This option becomes relevant when you want to connect your Camel route with an existing Elasticsearch cluster without explicitly specifying the nodes. In other words, it allows for dynamic discovery of cluster members during runtime rather than needing to list them individually in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the optional advanced option "sniffAfterFailureDelay" in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component, and how is it used?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional advanced option "sniffAfterFailureDelay" in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component is an integer of 60000 milliseconds (equivalent to 1 minute). This option determines the delay of a sniff execution scheduled after a failure. If not set, it allows Elasticsearch to self-heal and resume indexing or searching operations automatically after encountering issues. This feature is part of the advanced group of configuration options in the Elasticsearch component.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "snifferInterval" option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component, and can it be set or skipped if "sniffOnFailure" is enabled?'
      answer: |
       'The "snifferInterval" option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component is an advanced setting that determines the interval between consecutive ordinary sniff executions, measured in milliseconds. It''s worth noting that this interval will be respected when "sniffOnFailure" is disabled or when there are no failures between consecutive sniff executions. The default value for this option is 300000 (or 300 seconds). If you prefer not to set it, or if the sniffer should run immediately after a failure with "sniffOnFailure" enabled, it can be skipped as the Elasticsearch sniffer behavior adjusts accordingly.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "certificatePath" option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "certificatePath" option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component is designed for specifying the path to a self-signed certificate used for secure access to Elasticsearch. Its default value is null, meaning no certificate is specified by default. This option is optional, as indicated by the "required": false property in its definition. The group this option belongs to is security.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and can it be set to true or false for the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component option named "enableSSL"?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component option named "enableSSL" is false, meaning SSL is not enabled by default. However, you can change its value to true to enable SSL connectivity if needed, under the security group of configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, required status, and group association of the Apache Camel Elasticsearch option named "password"? Also, what value should this option have if security authentication is enabled?              Answer: The purpose of the Apache Camel Elasticsearch option named "password" is for authenticating. Its default value is null (meaning it isn''t set by default). The data type is string. It requires a value only when security is enabled, and it belongs to the "security" group.'
      answer: |
       'If you are referring to the Elasticsearch option named "password" within Apache Camel, its purpose is for authentication. By default, this option does not have a value assigned (defaultValue: null). It is of data type string. This option is not mandatory unless security authentication is enabled, and it falls under the "security" group. When security authentication is required, you should set the password option with an appropriate secure string for successful authorization.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, required status, and possible group of the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component option named "user"?'
      answer: |
       'The "user" option within the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component is designed for basic authentication of users. It accepts a string as its input, but it does not have a default value. Its use is optional, meaning that you can choose whether or not to provide a user credentials in your configuration. This option falls under the group "security".'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component''s "connectionTimeout" option, and is it a required configuration parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component''s "connectionTimeout" option is an integer with a value of 30000 (milliseconds). This option determines the time to wait before establishing a connection times out, and it is not a required configuration parameter. It falls under the "producer" group.'
    - question: 'Here is a question that can be answered using the provided information about the "disconnect" option for the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component:              In the context of using the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component, what is the default setting for the "disconnect" option and what does it do when set to true?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component, the default value for the "disconnect" option is false. When set to true, this option instructs the component to disconnect after it finishes calling the producer, meaning it will close the connection to Elasticsearch once the operation is completed.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel Elasticsearch option named "enableDocumentOnlyMode", and when might it be beneficial to enable this option during the migration of routes based on the legacy component camel-elasticsearch-rest?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel Elasticsearch option "enableDocumentOnlyMode" controls whether the body of an Elasticsearch message contains only documents. By default, it is set to false, enabling features compatible with what the Document API supports (refer to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs.html for more information).              During the migration of routes based on the legacy component camel-elasticsearch-rest, it is recommended to consider enabling this mode, particularly when dealing with update operations. This setting simplifies the transition and ensures compatibility with the new Elasticsearch API behavior.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it''s required for the "from" option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component when used as a producer?'
      answer: |
       'The "from" option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component, when used as a producer, is an index starting point for the response. Its default value is null, meaning it starts from the beginning of the index by default. The data type of this option is integer, and it''s not mandatory to provide a value for this option, although including one can potentially optimize query performance based on the size of your index and desired results. This option falls under the "producer" group of configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it''s required for the hostAddresses option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component, and which group does this option belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The `hostAddresses` option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component is a comma-separated list of remote transport addresses in ip:port format to use for communication. Its default value is null, meaning no default address is set. The data type is string, and it''s not required, which means you can choose whether or not to provide an address. This option belongs to the producer group.'
    - question: 'What is the optional string parameter `indexName` in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component used for, and what is its default value and data type? Also, when is this parameter considered required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The `indexName` parameter in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component is an optional string parameter that specifies the name of the index to operate against in Elasticsearch. Its default value is null, meaning it can be omitted if you wish to use the default index. This parameter is considered optional as indicated by its group "producer", but can be specified when needed for more precise operations on specific indices within your Elasticsearch environment.'
    - question: 'What is the default value, data type, and description of the optional Apache Camel Elasticsearch component configuration property "maxRetryTimeout", and under which group can this option be found in the producer settings?'
      answer: |
       'The "maxRetryTimeout" option for the Elasticsearch component in Apache Camel is an optional integer configuration property with a default value of 30000 milliseconds (or 30 seconds). This property determines the time before retry when an error occurs during communication with Elasticsearch. This setting can be found under the "producer" group within the configuration options for the component.'
    - question: 'What operation can be specified when using the Apache Camel Elasticsearch producer component? (The default value is not set.)'
      answer: |
       'The operation that can be specified when utilizing the Apache Camel Elasticsearch producer component is customizable, meaning you have the flexibility to choose an operation according to your requirements. However, it''s important to note that the default value for this option is not set by default.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component option named "scrollKeepAliveMs", and can this configuration be considered as a mandatory or optional setting?'
      answer: |
       'The default data type for the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component option named "scrollKeepAliveMs" is an integer, and its default value is 60000 (milliseconds). This configuration is considered optional, as indicated by the "required": false property in the given information.'
    - question: 'What is the default value, data type, and whether it is required for the Apache Camel Elasticsearch producer option named "size", and what group does this option belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel Elasticsearch producer option named "size" is null, it belongs to the data type integer, and it''s not required (indicated by the "required": false property). Lastly, this option falls under the "producer" group.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the optional Apache Camel Elasticsearch component''s socketTimeout option, and can you explain its purpose in the context of producing messages?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional Apache Camel Elasticsearch component''s socketTimeout option is an integer set at 30000 (milliseconds). This option determines the timeout in milliseconds before the socket will time out while waiting for a response when producing messages. In other words, it specifies how long to wait for a successful connection or data transfer with Elasticsearch before considering the operation as failed or timing out.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and whether it is required for using the Apache Camel Elasticsearch "useScroll" option in producer groups, when scrolling usage is enabled or disabled?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for enabling scroll usage in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component within producer groups is false, meaning that scrolling is disabled by default. However, using it is not a requirement.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "waitForActiveShards" option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component, and is it required when using this component as a producer?'
      answer: |
       'The "waitForActiveShards" option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component serves to ensure that the index creation waits for the specified number of shards to become active before proceeding. This option has a default value of 1, meaning it will wait for one active shard by default. However, it''s important to note that this option is not mandatory; its usage is optional when employing the Elasticsearch component as a producer in your workflow.'
    - question: 'How does configuring the "lazyStartProducer" option in an Apache Camel Elasticsearch component affect the behavior of the producer, and when is it advantageous to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'Configuring the "lazyStartProducer" option in an Apache Camel Elasticsearch component allows you to defer the startup of the producer until the first message is processed. This can be beneficial in situations where initiating the producer during context start might cause issues, leading the route to fail being started.              By setting this option to true, you allow the CamelContext and routes to initialize successfully, and subsequently handle any startup failure through Camel''s routing error handlers. It''s important to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some additional time, potentially prolonging the total processing time of the process.              In summary, configuring "lazyStartProducer" to true can help ensure a successful startup of your Camel route, even in cases where an Elasticsearch producer might initially fail during context start. However, be aware that this approach may increase the processing time for the first message in each run.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "documentClass" option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component, and is it mandatory or optional to specify this option? (Hint: The option description states that it''s used for deserializing documents, and the default value is ObjectNode.)'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component, the "documentClass" option specifies the class to be used when deserializing the incoming documents from Elasticsearch. The default value for this option is ObjectNode, which means that if you don''t explicitly set it, Camel will use Jackson''s ObjectNode as the document class. It''s an optional setting, meaning you can choose to provide your own class if needed, but if left unspecified, Camel will continue with the default.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component to enable automatic discovery of nodes from a running Elasticsearch cluster using the ''enableSniffer'' option, and what is the default value for this option when not specified explicitly? Additionally, how does this behavior interact with Spring Boot configuration, and are there any specific groups under which this option can be found in Camel configuration?'
      answer: |
       'To enable automatic discovery of nodes from a running Elasticsearch cluster using the ''enableSniffer'' option in Apache Camel Elasticsearch component, you should set the value of this option to true. However, if you are using Spring Boot along with Elasticsearch, this behavior is managed by the Spring Boot configuration instead. The default value for the ''enableSniffer'' option when not specified explicitly is false. This option can be found under the "advanced" groups in Camel configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component''s "sniffAfterFailureDelay" option, and can it be configured as a required parameter within the groups specified under the ''advanced'' category?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "sniffAfterFailureDelay" option in the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component is an integer of 60000 milliseconds, which equates to 1 minute. This option determines the delay for a sniff execution scheduled after a failure. It''s important to note that this option is not required, meaning it can be omitted from configuration if preferred. Additionally, the "sniffAfterFailureDelay" option can only be configured within the ''advanced'' category of parameters.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible usage of the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component option named "snifferInterval", and how does it behave in relation to the "sniffOnFailure" option?'
      answer: |
       'The "snifferInterval" option for the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component is an advanced setting that determines the interval between consecutive ordinary sniff executions, measured in milliseconds. Its default value is 300,000 milliseconds (or 5 minutes). This option will take effect when "sniffOnFailure" is disabled or if there are no failures between consecutive sniff executions. Therefore, you can use the "snifferInterval" to control how frequently changes in your Elasticsearch indexes are detected and indexed by Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel Elasticsearch option "certificatePath" and where can it be loaded from (classpath, file system, HTTP)? Is its use optional and does it have a default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "certificatePath" option in Apache Camel''s Elasticsearch component is used to specify the certificate for accessing the ElasticSearch cluster. This certificate can be loaded from various systems: by default, it can be loaded from the classpath, but you can also load it from the file system using ''file:'' prefix or from an HTTP server using ''http:''. It''s important to note that while this option is not required, its use can enhance security when communicating with the ElasticSearch cluster. The default value for "certificatePath" is null.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and required status for the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component''s option "enableSSL", and can this option be configured under the security group?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel Elasticsearch component''s "enableSSL" option is false, and it is not required to be set. However, this option can be configured under the security group.'
