    - question: 'How does the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel Google Pub/Sub Lite component function, and when is it useful to use this option instead of the default ExceptionHandler?'
      answer: |
       'The `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel Google Pub/Sub Lite component enables bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which means any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. This option is useful when the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. The default behavior is for the consumer to use the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler`, which logs exceptions at WARN or ERROR level and ignores them. However, using `bridgeErrorHandler` provides a more robust way of handling exceptions by processing them as messages, allowing for custom error-handling strategies. Keep in mind that this feature is only available if the 3rd party component supports it; some components handle exceptions internally, making bridgeErrorHandler not possible in those cases.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the option "consumerBytesOutstanding" in the Apache Camel component Google Pub/Sub Lite, and under what group settings can it be configured?'
      answer: |
       'The "consumerBytesOutstanding" option in the Apache Camel component Google Pub/Sub Lite is designed to specify the number of quota bytes that may be outstanding to the client. This value must exceed the maximum allowed size of the largest message (1 MiB). By default, it is set to 10485760 bytes (10 MB). It falls under the "consumer (advanced)" group settings, indicating it''s an optional configuration option for more advanced users.'
    - question: 'What is the allowed range and default value for the "consumerMessagesOutstanding" option in the Apache Camel Google Pub/Sub Lite component, and why is it optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "consumerMessagesOutstanding" option in the Apache Camel Google Pub/Sub Lite component allows you to specify the number of messages that can be outstanding (i.e., not yet acknowledged) for a client. The default value is 1000, but it must be set to exactly 0 to ensure proper operation. This option is considered optional and belongs to the "consumer (advanced)" group due to its specific use case in fine-tuning message processing. When set to 0, the component ensures that each message is acknowledged individually before proceeding with the next one, enhancing overall synchronization and error handling.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Pub/Sub Lite affect the behavior of the producer, and when is it beneficial to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Pub/Sub Lite allows for a deferred start of the producer, which can be advantageous in situations where the initial startup of the producer may otherwise cause the route to fail. By starting lazy, you can handle any potential failures during the route startup using Camel''s routing error handlers.              However, it is essential to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some time, which could prolong the total processing time of the processing. Consequently, this option is beneficial in scenarios where you want to ensure a successful startup of your route, even if there are temporary issues with setting up the Google Pub/Sub Lite producer, while still maintaining efficient performance for regular message processing once the producer has been initiated.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "publisherCacheSize" option in the Apache Camel Google-PubSub-Lite component, and under what group is it categorized if a user wants to configure this optional setting in their advanced producer settings?'
      answer: |
       'The "publisherCacheSize" option in the Apache Camel Google-PubSub-Lite component is designed to specify the maximum number of producers that can be cached. This feature is particularly useful when you have a large number of producers associated with various topics. By increasing this value, you can improve the efficiency of your Pub/Sub operations. The default value for "publisherCacheSize" is 100. It should be noted that this setting is categorized under the "producer (advanced)" group, which means it''s meant for advanced configurations in your producer settings if you wish to adjust it.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "publisherCacheTimeout" option within the Apache Camel''s Google Cloud Pub/Sub Lite component, and can it be considered as a required configuration when using the producer? Additionally, if I choose to set this option, what unit of measurement should I use for its value?'
      answer: |
       'The "publisherCacheTimeout" option within Apache Camel''s Google Cloud Pub/Sub Lite component is an advanced setting that specifies, in milliseconds, how long each producer should remain alive in the cache. Its default value is 180000 milliseconds (or 3 minutes). This option is not required for basic use of the producer, but it can be adjusted if you wish to control the time a producer stays active in the cache. If you choose to set this option, remember to use milliseconds as the unit of measurement.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "publisherTerminationTimeout" option in the Google PubSub Lite component of Apache Camel, when it comes to setting a time limit for a producer''s termination process, and is its use optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "publisherTerminationTimeout" option in the Google PubSub Lite component of Apache Camel sets the maximum duration (in milliseconds) a producer is allowed to take before it is forcefully terminated. This option gives you control over how long your publisher can run before it must close, which can be useful for handling long-running tasks or situations where a producer might get stuck. The default value for this option is 60000 milliseconds (1 minute). It''s important to note that the use of "publisherTerminationTimeout" is optional; if not specified, it will operate with the default value.'
    - question: 'How does the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Google Pub/Sub Lite component affect its behavior, and can it be disabled if not needed in an advanced configuration scenario?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s Google Pub/Sub Lite component, the "autowiredEnabled" option determines whether automatic autowiring is enabled or not. When set to true (its default value), this option allows for the automatic lookup of a single instance of matching type in the registry, which gets configured on the component. This is useful for automatically configuring resources like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. However, if you wish to disable autowiring in an advanced configuration scenario where you prefer manual configuration, you can set this option to false. Keep in mind that this option falls under the "advanced" group of configurations.'
    - question: 'How should I provide a Service Account Key for use as credentials when using the Apache Camel Google Pub/Sub Lite component (google-pubsub-lite), and are there any specific requirements or formats for this key if it is loaded from different systems like classpath, file system, or HTTP?'
      answer: |
       'To provide a Service Account Key for use as credentials when utilizing the Apache Camel Google Pub/Sub Lite component (google-pubsub-lite), you can load it in several ways: classpath, file system, or HTTP. The key itself is of type string. However, if you wish to load it from a different system, you can do so by prefixing the path with "classpath:", "file:", or "http:". For instance, if loading from the classpath, use "classpath:my-key.json", or if loading from the file system, use "file:/path/to/my-key.json". Remember that while it''s not required, loading from security-sensitive locations like the file system or HTTP may present potential security risks, so handle these resources with care and ensure secure transmission and storage.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "loggerId" option in the Apache Camel Google Pub/Sub Lite component, and is it optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'The "loggerId" option in the Apache Camel Google Pub/Sub Lite component is a string-type parameter used to specify a Logger ID when a match to the parent route is required. Its default value is null and it''s an optional parameter, meaning that providing it is not mandatory for the component to function.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the ''ackMode'' option in the Apache Camel Google Pub/Sub Lite component regarding automatically acknowledging messages and requiring explicit acknowledgement? Also, what are the possible values for this option, and can it be set as a requirement when using the consumer group?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the ''ackMode'' option in the Apache Camel Google Pub/Sub Lite component is to automatically acknowledge messages (AUTO) upon their completion. This means that the exchange receives an acknowledgment or a negative acknowledgment when the message processing is finished. However, if you set the value as NONE, the downstream process will have to explicitly acknowledge or negatively acknowledge the messages. This option can be used with consumer groups, but its use is not required.'
    - question: 'How many concurrent consumer streams are created by default when using the Apache Camel Google Pub/Sub Lite component, and is it possible to change this number to consume messages in parallel?'
      answer: |
       'By default, when using the Apache Camel Google Pub/Sub Lite component, one concurrent consumer stream is created. However, it is possible to change the number of parallel streams consuming from the subscription as the "concurrentConsumers" option allows adjusting this value. This can be done to consume messages in parallel.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the "maxAckExtensionPeriod" option in the Apache Camel component "google-pubsub-lite", and is it mandatory to set this option when using the consumer group?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "maxAckExtensionPeriod" option in the Apache Camel component "google-pubsub-lite" is an integer type with a value of 3600 seconds (1 hour). This option specifies the maximum period that a message acknowledgement deadline will be extended. It''s important to note that setting this option is not mandatory as it can be left unset when using the consumer group.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum number of messages that can be received from Google Pub/Sub Server in a single API call when using Apache Camel''s Google Pub/Sub Lite component, and is it possible to configure this limit?'
      answer: |
       'The maximum number of messages you can receive from Google Pub/Sub Server in a single API call when using Apache Camel''s Google Pub/Sub Lite component can be configured. This limit is controlled by the "maxMessagesPerPoll" option, with its default value being 1. However, it''s optional and can be adjusted according to your specific use case.'
    - question: 'How does the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel component Google Pub/Sub Lite handle exceptions that occur during message consumption, and how can it be configured to use the routing Error Handler instead of the default exception handling?'
      answer: |
       'The `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel component for Google Pub/Sub Lite allows for bridging the consumer to the routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages will be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.              However, it''s important to note that this functionality is only possible if the third-party component allows Camel to be notified when an exception was thrown. Some components handle exceptions internally, making bridgeErrorHandler unavailable. In situations where improvement of the Camel component to hook into the third-party component can make this feature possible for future releases.              By default, the consumer uses the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler` to deal with exceptions, which will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and then ignored. To configure the component to use the routing Error Handler instead of the default exception handling, set the `bridgeErrorHandler` option to true in your component configuration. This option is found under the "consumer (advanced)" group.'
    - question: 'What custom ExceptionHandler can be used when working with Apache Camel''s Google Pub/Sub Lite component, and how does the use of this custom ExceptionHandler differ from the default behavior when no exceptionHandler is provided? Additionally, under what circumstances would the bridgeErrorHandler option take precedence over the exceptionHandler option?'
      answer: |
       'When working with Apache Camel''s Google Pub/Sub Lite component, you have the option to use a custom ExceptionHandler by setting the "exceptionHandler" option in your configuration. By default, the consumer will handle exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. However, if you wish to manage exceptions in a custom manner, you can provide an instance of your own ExceptionHandler.              It''s important to note that if the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled, the "exceptionHandler" option will not be used. The bridgeErrorHandler handles all types of errors and exceptions, including those that would typically be logged at WARN or ERROR level by the consumer. This means that using the bridgeErrorHandler effectively disables the functionality provided by the exceptionHandler option.              In summary, to customize exception handling when working with Apache Camel''s Google Pub/Sub Lite component, you can use the "exceptionHandler" option in your configuration. However, if you enable the "bridgeErrorHandler" option, the exceptionHandler will not be invoked.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel component "google-pubsub-lite", and is it required for basic usage? (Hint: Consult the provided information.)'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel component "google-pubsub-lite" does not have a default value and it''s an advanced feature. Its purpose is to set the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. This means, it determines how messages are exchanged between components. However, it''s worth noting that this option is not required for basic usage of the component. It falls under the "consumer (advanced)" group, indicating it''s a more specialized configuration setting.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component Google Pub/Sub Lite, and under what circumstances might it be beneficial to set this option to true? Additionally, can you explain any potential drawbacks when using this feature?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component Google Pub/Sub Lite allows you to configure whether the producer should start lazily (on the first message). This setting can be beneficial in situations where starting the producer might otherwise cause the route to fail during startup, thereby preventing the entire CamelContext and routes from being started.              When set to true, the producer will not start immediately upon the CamelContext''s or route''s initialization. Instead, it will only start when the first message is processed, allowing the routing errors to be handled through Camel''s built-in error handlers. This delay in starting the producer can help ensure a smooth startup process for your routes and CamelContext.              However, there are potential drawbacks to consider. When the first message is processed and the producer starts, creating and initializing it may take some additional time, which could prolong the total processing time of the processing. This delay might be noticeable if the producer requires a significant amount of resources or setup time. Additionally, depending on the nature of your messages and routes, you may encounter issues related to the order in which messages are processed, as the producer will not be ready to handle the first message immediately upon startup.              Ultimately, whether to use "lazyStartProducer" depends on your specific application requirements and the characteristics of the messages being processed by your Camel routes using the Google Pub/Sub Lite component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "pubsubEndpoint" option within the Apache Camel Google Pub/Sub Lite component, and is it required for basic usage? Also, is there a default value provided for this option, and in which group of configurations does it belong to (producer or consumer)?'
      answer: |
       'The "pubsubEndpoint" option within the Apache Camel Google Pub/Sub Lite component serves the purpose of providing a specific Pub/Sub endpoint to use when message ordering is essential, particularly in scenarios with multiple publishers. Its usage ensures that messages are received in order, despite having multiple sources publishing to the same topic. However, it''s not a required option for basic usage of the component. There is no default value provided for this option, and it belongs to the "producer (advanced)" group of configurations.'
    - question: 'What custom object can be used as a serializer for message payloads when using the Google PubSub Lite component in Apache Camel''s producer (advanced) configuration, and is this usage optional?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s advanced producer configuration with Google PubSub Lite, you can utilize a custom GooglePubsubLiteSerializer as an option for serializing message payloads. This custom object is optional and can be configured at your discretion in the producer settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel Google PubSub Lite component, and how can it be loaded from different systems (classpath, file system, HTTP) if not loaded by default?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel Google PubSub Lite component serves as a means to provide credentials for both the PubSub publisher and subscriber. Specifically, it uses the Service account key. This can be loaded by default from classpath, but if not loaded automatically, you can load it manually by prefixing with `classpath:`, `file:` or `http:` to load the resource from different systems. For instance, `classpath:` references the local classpath, `file:` specifies a file on your system, and `http:` loads the key from an HTTP address. This flexibility allows you to manage and access your Service account key across various systems seamlessly.'
