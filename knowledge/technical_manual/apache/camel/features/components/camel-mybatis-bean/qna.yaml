    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "configurationUri" option in the Apache Camel MyBatis-bean component, and is it required?'
      answer: |
       'The "configurationUri" option in the Apache Camel MyBatis-bean component serves as the location for your MyBatis XML configuration file. By default, this value is set to "SqlMapConfig.xml", which is loaded from the classpath. Note that this parameter is optional; it''s not a strict requirement for using the MyBatis component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component "mybatis-bean", and under what circumstances might it be beneficial to configure this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component "mybatis-bean" determines whether the producer should be started lazily (on the first message). This setting can be useful when a producer may fail during the starting of the CamelContext or routes, causing the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy, the failure can be handled during routing messages using Camel''s error handlers. However, it is important to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. The default value for "lazyStartProducer" is false, but configuring it to true might be beneficial in scenarios where the producer has dependencies that are difficult or slow to initialize during startup.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel mybatis-bean component affect the configuration process, and is it necessary to enable this option by default?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel MyBatis bean component allows for automatic autowiring of components based on their type in the registry. If marked as autowired, when a single instance of a matching type is found, it will be configured onto the component. This can be particularly useful for configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, and similar resources. However, it''s not necessary to enable this option by default; its use depends on your specific integration needs and whether you wish to leverage automatic configuration. This option is considered an advanced feature grouped in the "advanced" category of the Camel configuration options.'
    - question: 'How do I provide a custom SqlSessionFactory instance when using the Apache Camel MyBatis component, and is it mandatory to provide one if I don''t specify a default value?'
      answer: |
       'To utilize a custom SqlSessionFactory instance with the Apache Camel MyBatis component, you can set the "sqlSessionFactory" property in the component configuration. Providing a custom SqlSessionFactory is optional; if no default value is specified, Camel will not enforce its use. The "sqlSessionFactory" option belongs to the advanced group of settings and might not be required for basic MyBatis operations.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel MyBatis-Bean component, and under which configuration group can it be manually set or overridden if needed?'
      answer: |
       'The "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel MyBatis-Bean component is a boolean parameter used to enable or disable all consumer-based health checks from this component. Its default value is true, meaning that health checks are enabled by default. If you need to manually set or override it, you can find this configuration under the "health" group in your Camel XML or Java DSL setup.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel mybatis-bean component''s `healthCheckProducerEnabled` option to disable all producer based health checks from this component?'
      answer: |
       'To disable all producer based health checks from the Apache Camel mybatis-bean component, you don''t need to set any value for the `healthCheckProducerEnabled` option as its default value is already true (meaning health checks are enabled). If you wish to turn off producer checks globally for all components in your Camel application, you can do so by setting `camel.health.producersEnabled=false`.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible options for the ''executorType'' option in the Apache Camel component ''mybatis-bean'', and can this option be considered mandatory when using it as a producer?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the ''executorType'' option in the Apache Camel component ''mybatis-bean'' is SIMPLE. This option determines the executor type to be used while executing statements. You have three possible options: simple, reuse, and batch. If you wish, you can specify a different option than the default, but it is not mandatory to do so when using ''mybatis-bean'' as a producer within the ''producer'' groups.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "inputHeader" option in the Apache Camel''s mybatis-bean component, and can it be set to a specific string value or requires it to be null by default? Also, is using this option necessary for a producer, and if so, which group does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The "inputHeader" option in Apache Camel''s mybatis-bean component allows you to use header values instead of message body for input parameters. By default, it is set to null, which means the input parameters are taken from the message body. However, if you set "inputHeader" to a specific string value, the query parameters will be taken from the corresponding header in the message instead. It''s important to note that using this option is not mandatory but belongs to the "producer" group of options.'
    - question: 'How does setting the "outputHeader" option in the Apache Camel mybatis-bean component affect the storage location of query results and the preservation of the message body?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "outputHeader" option in the Apache Camel mybatis-bean component allows for storing the query result in a header rather than the message body. By default, the query result is stored in the message body and any existing content in the message body is discarded. If you set outputHeader, the specified value becomes the name of the header where the query result will be stored, preserving the original message body. Additionally, setting outputHeader omits populating the default CamelMyBatisResult header since it would always be the same as outputHeader in this case.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component affect the behavior of the producer, and when is it recommended to use this feature?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component allows the producer to start lazily upon receiving the first message, rather than during the initial startup of the CamelContext or route. This can be beneficial when a producer may potentially fail during the starting process, thus preventing the route from being started. Instead, any startup failures will be handled through Camel''s routing error handlers during the processing of messages.              However, it is important to note that since the producer will only start after the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may slightly prolong the overall processing time of the route. This feature is recommended for advanced users who encounter issues during the initial startup of their components due to possible failures and wish to defer the startup process until the routing of messages begins.'
