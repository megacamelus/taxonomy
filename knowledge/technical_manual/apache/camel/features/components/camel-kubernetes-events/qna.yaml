    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "kubernetesClient" option in the Apache Camel component "kubernetes-events", and is it required for use?'
      answer: |
       'The "kubernetesClient" option in the Apache Camel component "kubernetes-events" serves to utilize an existing Kubernetes client. It does not have a default value, meaning you''ll need to provide your own instance when using this option. The usage of this option is optional for integrating with Kubernetes events within yourCamel application.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel Kubernetes-Events component allow for external exceptions to be processed as messages by the routing Error Handler, and what is the default behavior if this option is not enabled?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel Kubernetes-Events component allows external exceptions that occur during message pickup by the consumer to be processed as messages by the routing Error Handler. This is possible only if the third-party component supports notifying Camel when an exception is thrown. If this option is not enabled, the default behavior is for the consumer to use the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler` to handle exceptions. These exceptions will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored as messages.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Kubernetes-events component affect the behavior of the producer, and when is it recommended to use this feature?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Kubernetes-events component allows for a more flexible and resilient approach to starting the associated producer. Instead of initializing the producer during the route startup, it will be deferred until the first message arrives. This can be beneficial when the producer may otherwise fail during the route''s initialization, thus preventing the entire route from starting up successfully.              By choosing a lazy start for the producer, you can handle any startup failures through Camel''s routing error handlers. However, take note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time, which could prolong the overall processing time of the operation.              It is recommended to use this feature in situations where the producer might cause issues during the route startup, such as when dealing with external dependencies or resources that are slow to become available. Using "lazyStartProducer" can help ensure a more reliable and robust CamelContext and routes by deferring potential problems until they can be handled efficiently within the routing process.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Kubernetes-Events component, and can it be disabled if necessary?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Kubernetes-Events component is set to a default value of true, indicating that autowiring is enabled by default. This option allows for automatic autowiring of certain options such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc., by looking up in the registry to find a single instance of matching type. If you wish to disable this feature, you can do so by setting "autowiredEnabled" to false under advanced settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "apiVersion" option in the Apache Camel kubernetes-events component and is it required or optional? Also, does this option have a default value and what type of data should be provided when configuring it?'
      answer: |
       'The "apiVersion" option, found within the Apache Camel Kubernetes events component, specifies the version of the Kubernetes API to use in your configuration. It is an optional field, meaning you don''t have to provide a value for it if you prefer using the latest version available. However, if you want to explicitly specify a version, it should be provided as a string. By default, this option does not have a predefined value.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "dnsDomain" option in the Apache Camel Kubernetes Events component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "dnsDomain" option in the Apache Camel Kubernetes Events component serves the purpose of defining the domain used for ServiceCall External IP (EIP) within your Kubernetes environment. By default, it does not have a value assigned (defaultValue: null). Lastly, its usage is optional as indicated by "required: false".'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior for providing a custom KubernetesClient when using the Apache Camel kubernetes-events component, and can it be omitted if no custom client is intended?'
      answer: |
       'When using the Apache Camel kubernetes-events component, there is no default KubernetesClient provided. If you wish to use a custom KubernetesClient, you may provide one, but it is optional. If no custom client is intended, you can omit providing one.'
    - question: 'How is the ''namespace'' option in the Apache Camel component ''kubernetes-events'' described, what type of value can it accept, whether it is required or optional, and if a default value is provided when not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The ''namespace'' option in the Kubernetes-Events component of Apache Camel is a string type that describes a logical separation of resources within a cluster. It accepts a string value for the namespace, which can be set to any valid Kubernetes namespace name. This option is optional, meaning it can either be provided or left unspecified, and it does not have a default value in this configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''portName'' option in the Apache Camel ''kubernetes-events'' component, and is it required? (Answer: The port name, used for ServiceCall EIP. Default Value: null. It is not required.)'

      answer: |
       'The `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel Kubernetes-Events component enables bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which means any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. This is beneficial when the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. If the component handles exceptions internally, bridgeErrorHandler may not be possible. By default, the consumer uses the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler for dealing with exceptions, which logs them at WARN or ERROR level and ignores them. Setting `bridgeErrorHandler` to true can provide a more customized error handling approach when working with components that allow it.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom exception handler when using the Apache Camel Kubernetes-Events component for handling Kubernetes events? And what happens by default if no custom exception handler is provided in this scenario?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom ExceptionHandler when utilizing the Apache Camel Kubernetes-Events component for managing Kubernetes events, you can set the "exceptionHandler" option within your consumer configuration. By default, the component will handle exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored if no custom exception handler is provided. However, if the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled, the "exceptionHandler" option will not be in use. The "exceptionHandler" accepts an object as its value, but it is optional and falls under the advanced groups of consumer settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "exchangePattern" option within the Apache Camel Kubernetes-events component, and can it be configured optionaly when creating a consumer? Additionally, in which group of Camel options does this particular attribute belong?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option within the Apache Camel Kubernetes-events component is an optional setting that determines the exchange pattern when a consumer creates an exchange. By default, it has no specific value. When configured, you can customize the behavior of how messages are exchanged between producers and consumers in your messaging system. This attribute belongs to the "consumer (advanced)" group of Camel options.'
    - question: 'What are the possible string values for the "operation" option in the Apache Camel component "kubernetes-events", if this option is not required and has a default value of null? Is there any specific group it belongs to?'
      answer: |
       'The "operation" option in the Apache Camel component "kubernetes-events" does not require a string value, and its default is null. If provided, valid string values could be actions such as create, update, delete, or watch, depending on the specific Kubernetes operations your application requires. This option belongs to the "producer" group, indicating it is relevant for producing events in Kubernetes using Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component Kubernetes-events affect the behavior of the producer, and why might it be beneficial to use this option?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component Kubernetes-events allows the producer to be started only when the first message is processed instead of during the initial startup of the route or CamelContext. This behavior can be useful in situations where a producer may cause the route to fail during starting due to unavailability, misconfiguration, or other issues. By deferring the startup of the producer until message processing, you can handle these failures using Camel''s routing error handlers. However, be aware that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some additional time, which could prolong the overall processing time of the route. This option comes under the "producer (advanced)" group in the component configuration, suggesting it might be more appropriate for advanced users or specific use cases where failure handling during messaging is required.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the connectionTimeout option in the Apache Camel kubernetes-events component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "connectionTimeout" option in the Apache Camel Kubernetes-Events component is an optional integer field with no default value. It specifies the timeout in milliseconds to use when making requests to the Kubernetes API server. This setting falls under the advanced group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `caCertData` option in the Apache Camel Kubernetes Events component and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option during configuration?'
      answer: |

This data is crucial for establishing trust between your application and the Kubernetes API server, which aids in the secure communication of events. However, providing a value for this option is not mandatory during configuration; it''s an optional setting within the ''security'' group of the component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `caCertFile` option in the Apache Camel Kubernetes Events component, and is it required for the component to function? Additionally, what data type does this option accept and is there a default value assigned to it?'
      answer: |
       'The `caCertFile` option in the Apache Camel Kubernetes Events component serves as a reference to a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate file. This option is not mandatory for the component''s functionality, but it can be useful in securing communication when using TLS, particularly within the "security" group of options. The data type accepted by this option is `string`. However, there is no default value assigned to `caCertFile`, so you will need to provide a path to your CA certificate file if you choose to use it.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientCertData" option in the Apache Camel Kubernetes Events component, and is it mandatory or optional to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientCertData" option within the Apache Camel Kubernetes Events component is designed for security purposes, providing a client certificate data. This option is not mandatory, as it has a default value of null, meaning you don''t necessarily need to provide a value if you choose not to use client certificates.'
