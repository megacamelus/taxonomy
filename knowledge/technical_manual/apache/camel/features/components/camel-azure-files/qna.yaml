    - question: 'Can you explain the purpose of the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files", and under what conditions would this option be set to true in order for exceptions during message pickup to be processed as messages by the routing Error Handler instead of being handled by the default ExceptionHandler?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files" allows for bridging exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages, to be processed as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler. This is possible if the third-party component used with azure-files allows Camel to be alerted when an exception was thrown. If the component handles exceptions internally and does not allow for such alerting, then "bridgeErrorHandler" cannot be used. By default, exceptions are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored by the consumer''s default ExceptionHandler. To enable the "bridgeErrorHandler", you would set it to true in your Camel configuration. When set to true, exceptions during message pickup will be processed as messages by the routing Error Handler instead of being handled by the default ExceptionHandler.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Azure Files component affect the startup behavior of a route, and what are potential advantages and disadvantages of using this feature?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Azure Files component allows for a more flexible startup behavior of your routes. By setting it to true (lazy mode), you can prevent the producer from starting during the initial context or route startup, which can help avoid situations where the producer may otherwise fail during startup and cause the entire route to fail as well.              When using lazyStartProducer, the producer is created and started only when the first message is processed. This deferred startup can be useful in handling potential failures that might occur during the producer initialization, which can then be managed by Camel''s routing error handlers.              However, it is important to note that when the first message is processed after enabling lazyStartProducer, creating and starting the producer may take a little additional time, potentially prolonging the overall processing time of your route. This could be a disadvantage if real-time performance or fast startup times are crucial for your application.              In summary, using the lazyStartProducer option offers flexibility in managing potential startup issues for your routes and can help improve resilience by utilizing Camel''s routing error handlers, but it may come at the expense of increased processing time for the first message processed through the producer.'
    - question: 'Given the information provided, here''s a question that could be asked about the Apache Camel component "azure-files" option named "autowiredEnabled":              "What is the purpose and default value of the ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel azure-files component? Additionally, why might you choose to disable this feature and how would you do so?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel azure-files component is designed for enabling automatic autowiring. This means it finds a single instance of matching type from the registry and configures it on the component automatically. This can be useful for configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, and more. Its default value is true.              You might choose to disable this feature if you prefer manual configuration or if you have specific needs that aren''t met by automatic autowiring. To disable it, since the ''autowiredEnabled'' option takes a boolean type, setting it to false will turn off this functionality. For example:              ```java       from("azure-files")         .componentProperty("autowiredEnabled", "false");       ```              In this example, the autowiring for azure-files component is disabled by explicitly setting the ''autowiredEnabled'' property to false.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files", and can it be omitted when using this component if its group belongs to the "health" category?'
      answer: |
       'The "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option in the Azure Files component for Apache Camel is a boolean setting used to enable or disable all consumer-based health checks from this specific component. Its default value is true, meaning that health checks are enabled by default. However, even if its group belongs to the "health" category, it can still be explicitly set or omitted as needed in your configuration based on your specific use case requirements.'
    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the option "healthCheckProducerEnabled" in the Apache Camel component "azure-files" impact producer-based health checks, and what is its default value and group association?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "healthCheckProducerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files" allows or disallows all producer-based health checks from this specific component. By default, Camel has disabled these producer-based health checks. If you wish to enable them globally, set ''camel.health.producersEnabled=true''. This option falls under the "health" group in configuration settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the option "credentialType" in the Apache Camel component "azure-files", and what are potential values this option can take if not provided as a default? (The option determines the credential strategy to adopt.)'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "credentialType" option in the Azure Files component of Apache Camel is SHARED_ACCOUNT_KEY. If you wish to use a different credential strategy, this option can take potential values such as ManagedIdentity, SAS, or AccessKey. However, if not provided, it will default to SHARED_ACCOUNT_KEY.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "disconnect" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files", and under what conditions should it be explicitly set to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "disconnect" option in the Azure Files component of Apache Camel has a default value of false. Its purpose is to determine whether or not to disconnect from the remote FTP server after use. When set to true, this option will only disconnect the current connection to the FTP server; it does not stop any consumer or route. You should explicitly set this option to true if you want to ensure that a specific connection is closed, but remember that stopping consumers or routes requires separate actions.'
    - question: 'What are possible values for the "doneFileName" option when using the Apache Camel Azure Files component, considering both the dynamically generated file name and the fixed file name scenario, and also understanding that only `${file.name}` and `${file.name.next}` can be used as dynamic placeholders?'
      answer: |
       'The "doneFileName" option in the Apache Camel Azure Files component supports both fixed file names and dynamically generated ones. For a fixed name, you can specify any string of your choice. If you prefer to use dynamic placeholders, only `${file.name}` and `${file.name.next}` are supported. The former refers to the original file''s name, while the latter refers to the next file in line (if applicable). In both scenarios, the done file will always be written in the same folder as the original file.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "fileName" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files", and how can it be dynamically set using both String and Expression types, considering the CamelOverruleFileName header?'
      answer: |
       'The "fileName" option in the Azure Files component of Apache Camel serves a dual purpose: for producers, it allows you to dynamically set the filename based on an expression, which is useful when evaluating the file to write. For consumers, it acts as a filter for selecting filenames to consume, such as consuming today''s file using the File Language syntax (e.g., mydata-${date:now:yyyyMMdd}.txt).              This option supports both String and Expression types for greater flexibility. If the expression is a String type, it will always be evaluated using the File Language. If it''s an Expression type, the specified Expression type is used (e.g., OGNL expressions), allowing you to customize the evaluation as needed.              It''s important to note that the CamelOverruleFileName header takes precedence over any existing CamelFileName header in producers. This header is used only once and simplifies the process, as it eliminates the need to temporarily store the CamelFileName and restore it later.'
    - question: 'How does one configure the optional ''sharedKey'' setting in the Apache Camel Azure Files component to utilize a storage account key for file operations instead of using the default method?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the optional ''sharedKey'' setting in the Apache Camel Azure Files component, you need to specify the storage account key for file operations instead of the default method. This can be achieved by providing a string value for the ''sharedKey'' property within your configuration or route definition. Here is an example:              ```       from("azure-files://<your-file-share>?sharedKey=<your-storage-account-key>")       ```              Ensure that you replace `<your-file-share>` with the name of your file share, and provide the storage account key as `<your-storage-account-key>`. Keep in mind that the ''sharedKey'' setting is optional, so if you don''t need to use a storage account key for authentication, you can simply omit this property.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and whether it''s mandatory to set the ''delete'' option in the ''azure-files'' component of Apache Camel when using it as a consumer, if this option is used to determine whether a successfully processed file should be deleted or not?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the ''delete'' option in the ''azure-files'' component of Apache Camel, when used as a consumer, is false. This means that the file will not be deleted automatically after it is successfully processed. Setting this option to true will cause the file to be deleted once processing is complete. However, it is not mandatory to set this option as it has a default value.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "moveFailed" option in the Apache Camel Azure Files component, and what syntax should be used to move failed files into a ".error" subdirectory? Also, can you explain how Camel handles moved files and if they will be picked up again by the component?'
      answer: |
       'The "moveFailed" option in the Apache Camel Azure Files component is designed to specify an action for moving failed files based on Simple language. To move failed files into a ".error" subdirectory, you should set the expression as ".error". When Camel moves the files to the fail location, it will handle the error and will not pick up the file again, ensuring that they are not processed repeatedly. This behavior is intended to optimize the processing flow, preventing unnecessary re-processing of already failed files.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of setting the "noop" option to true in the Apache Camel''s azure-files component, and what are the potential benefits and implications when using this option? Also, can you explain if there is a relationship between the "noop" option and the "idempotent" option when "noop" is set to true?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "noop" option to true in Apache Camel''s azure-files component indicates that the file will not be moved or deleted during processing. This is useful for read-only data or ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) type requirements where the data does not need to be modified or consumed multiple times. When "noop" is set to true, Camel automatically sets the "idempotent" option to true as well, preventing the same files from being processed repeatedly, thereby ensuring data integrity and avoiding potential duplication issues.'
    - question: 'How can I utilize the "preMove" option within the Apache Camel Azure Files component to dynamically set a filename when moving a file before processing, and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'To dynamically set a filename when moving a file before processing with the Azure Files component in Apache Camel, you can leverage the "preMove" option. This option accepts an expression (such as File Language), enabling you to move in-progress files into specific directories based on your needs. For instance, to move files into the order directory, simply set the value to "order". The default value for this option is null. Remember that the use of this option is optional and falls under the consumer group.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "preSort" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files" affect the ordering of file and directory names during polling, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "preSort" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files" means that the consumer will sort the retrieved file and directory names from the file system during polling. This can be beneficial if you need to operate on files in a specific order. Notably, this sorting happens before the consumer begins filtering and accepting files for processing by Camel. The default value of "preSort" is false (disabled), meaning that the sorting function is not active in this state.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "recursive" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "recursive" option in the Apache Camel Azure Files component serves to search for files not just within the specified directory, but also in all its subdirectories. Its default value is false, meaning that if omitted or set to false, only the files within the given directory will be considered. However, you''re not required to use it when working with this component as it has an optional nature.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "resumeDownload" option within the Apache Camel Azure Files component and under what circumstances should the local work directory be configured when using this option?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "resumeDownload" option within the Apache Camel Azure Files component is false. This setting configures whether resume download is enabled. To enable resuming of downloads, you must additionally configure the "localWorkDirectory" option to specify a local directory where downloaded files will be stored. While it''s not required, having this local work directory set up supports resumable downloads.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the Apach Camel component Azure-Files option "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" affect the behavior of a polling consumer when it fails to find any files during the polling interval?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option for the Apache Camel component Azure-Files will cause the polling consumer to send an empty message (no body) if it does not find any files during the specified polling interval. This can help you manage your application''s behavior by providing a notice that no new files were available, rather than the consumer waiting idly for the next polling cycle.'
    - question: 'How does setting the Apache Camel component "azure-files" option "streamDownload" to true affect file handling in a route compared to when it is set to false, and why would you need to set stepwise=false if streamDownload is enabled?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the Azure Files component''s "streamDownload" option to true alters the file handling behavior in a Camel route significantly. When set to true, the remote files are read directly from the server as they are required, without being loaded into memory beforehand. This can be beneficial for handling large files or situations where memory usage needs to be minimized.              However, if you enable "streamDownload", you must also disable the "stepwise" option, as both cannot be used simultaneously. Enabling "streamDownload" ensures that the route handles file transfer incrementally, reading and processing data in chunks rather than loading the entire file into memory at once, which can help manage memory consumption effectively.'
    - question: 'How does the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel component azure-files work, and why might it be beneficial to enable it? Furthermore, if the default value is false, what happens when no exception is handled by this option, and where can one find more information about this advanced group consumer setting?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel component azure-files allows for bridging exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages, to be processed as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler. This can be beneficial because it enables a more streamlined error handling process, where instead of simply logging exceptions, they are treated as messages and can be acted upon accordingly within your routing.              It''s important to note that this option is only applicable if the third-party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. If the component handles errors internally, bridgeErrorHandler is not possible. In some cases, future releases of the Camel component may be improved to better integrate with the third-party component and make this possibility a reality.              By default, when the bridgeErrorHandler option is disabled (its value is false), exceptions will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored by the consumer. When this option is not enabled, errors will not be treated as messages that can be handled by the routing Error Handler.              More information about this advanced group consumer setting can be found in the "consumer (advanced)" section of the Camel documentation.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and whether it is required for the ''download'' option in the ''azure-files'' component''s FTP consumer, if this option is set to false, will the file still be included in the Camel Exchange with details about the file such as file name, file size, etc.? Also, what groups does this option belong to and what are its data types and possible values?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the ''download'' option in the ''azure-files'' component''s FTP consumer is set to false. If you choose not to download the file when setting this option, the file details such as file name, file size, etc., will still be included in the Camel Exchange. However, the actual file itself will not be downloaded. This option belongs to the ''consumer (advanced)'' group and is of type boolean with possible values true or false.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom ExceptionHandler for an Apache Camel route using the Azure Files component, and what happens if the bridgeErrorHandler option is enabled while trying to set the exceptionHandler?'
      answer: |
       'In response to your query, you can configure a custom ExceptionHandler for an Apache Camel route using the Azure Files component by setting the "exceptionHandler" option within the consumer group (under advanced settings). If this option is provided, it will override the default exception handling behavior. However, if the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled simultaneously, the "exceptionHandler" will not be in use as the bridgeErrorHandler takes precedence over it.              By default, the consumer handles exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. If no custom ExceptionHandler is provided, this behavior remains consistent.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files" within the context of a file consumer, and can this option be configured if not set by default?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Azure Files component of Apache Camel, specifically when used as a file consumer, does not have a default value and serves to configure the exchange pattern when a consumer creates an exchange. This option is considered advanced and can be found under the "consumer (advanced)" group. If you choose to set a value for this option, it will regulate how the Camel Exchange is shaped in relation to the file being consumed from Azure Files.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "inProgressRepository" option within the Apache Camel component "azure-files", and what is the default value for this option, as well as which group does it belong to in terms of configuration options?'
      answer: |
       'The "inProgressRepository" option within the Apache Camel component "azure-files" serves a purpose of maintaining an account for the current files being processed, often referred to as in-progress files. By default, a memory-based repository is used, but it can be customized if needed. This configuration option falls under the advanced group named "consumer (advanced)".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "localWorkDirectory" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files", and when should it be used in a Camel route? Additionally, is there a default value for this option, and where does this setting fall within the Camel configuration groups?'
      answer: |
       'The "localWorkDirectory" option in the Azure Files component of Apache Camel is intended to allow the storage of remote file content directly on the local system, bypassing the need to load the entire content into memory. This feature becomes particularly useful when consuming large remote files, as it helps conserve memory resources. The configuration group for this setting lies within "consumer (advanced)". It''s important to note that there is no default value assigned to this option; developers must explicitly provide a desired directory path during route configuration if they wish to utilize this feature.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "onCompletionExceptionHandler" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files", and what custom behavior can be implemented when using this option? Is it possible to use a default implementation for this option, and where does this option belong in terms of required settings for the consumer component?'
      answer: |
       'The "onCompletionExceptionHandler" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files" is designed to allow custom handling of exceptions that occur during the file on completion process. This process involves either a commit or rollback operation. By default, any exception encountered will be logged at the WARN level and then ignored. However, you can implement a custom org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to replace this behavior as per your requirements. It''s important to note that the use of this option is considered advanced within the ''consumer'' group of settings. While there is no default value provided for this option, it can be left unspecified if you wish to rely on the default implementation.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "pollStrategy" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files", and what type of object can be provided as a custom implementation for this option, if any? Additionally, does this option have a default value or is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "pollStrategy" option in the Azure Files component of Apache Camel is designed to offer you the flexibility to provide your own custom implementation for controlling error handling that may occur during the poll operation before an Exchange (a message construct) has been created and routed within Camel. This object, specifically a subtype of `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy`, can be provided as a custom implementation. It''s essential to note that this option is optional, meaning it''s not required for use with the Azure Files component, and it doesn''t have a default value by default. The group associated with this option is "consumer (advanced)".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and functionality of the "processStrategy" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files", and under what circumstances should it be used instead of the readLock option?'
      answer: |
       'The "processStrategy" option in the Azure Files component of Apache Camel provides a customizable approach for handling file processing, allowing you to implement your own logic such as a read lock strategy or similar conditions. This option is particularly useful when specific prerequisites must be met before a file can be consumed, like the existence of a special ready file. Notably, if "processStrategy" is set, the traditional readLock approach will not apply. This advanced feature enables greater flexibility in managing your file-based integration scenarios according to your unique requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "checksumFileAlgorithm" option in the Apache Camel Azure-Files component, and can it be left empty or must a specific string be provided? Additionally, where will the checksum file be stored if created?'
      answer: |
       'The "checksumFileAlgorithm" option in the Apache Camel Azure-Files component is designed to generate a checksum file when the original file has been written. This option accepts a string value specifying the algorithm for creating the checksum file, such as SHA-256 or MD5. By default, there is no default value provided for this option, meaning it can be left empty if not required. However, if you want to generate a checksum file, a specific string representing the desired algorithm should be provided. The checksum file will always be stored in the same folder as the original file within your Azure File Share.'
    - question: 'What are the available actions when using the `fileExist` option in the `azure-files` component of Apache Camel, and how does each action behave when a file with the same name already exists? Specifically, I''m interested in understanding the differences between Override, Append, Fail, Ignore, Move, and TryRename.'
      answer: |
       'When using the `fileExist` option in the `azure-files` component of Apache Camel, several actions can be taken when a file with the same name already exists.              1. Override (default): This action replaces the existing file. If a file with the specified name already exists, it will be overwritten.              2. Append: This action adds content to the existing file. If a file with the specified name already exists, its contents will be appended with the new data.              3. Fail: This action throws a GenericFileOperationException, signaling that there is already an existing file. The data transfer will not occur, and you''ll need to handle the exception accordingly in your application logic.              4. Ignore: This action silently skips the problem without overriding the existing file. It assumes everything is okay and proceeds with the next operation.              5. Move: This option requires that the `moveExisting` option be configured as well. It moves any existing files before writing the target file. If an error occurs because an existing file already exists, you can use the `eagerDeleteTargetFile` option to control what to do in such cases; for example, it can delete the target file immediately, allowing the move operation to proceed.              6. TryRename: This action is applicable only when the `tempFileName` option is in use. It attempts to rename the file from the temporary name to the actual name without performing an existence check. This approach may be faster on some file systems and especially FTP servers, as it bypasses file permission checks during renaming.'
    - question: 'How does setting the "flatten" option to true for the Azure Files component in Apache Camel impact the behavior when writing files from sub-directories into a single directory, and what is the default value of this option?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "flatten" option to true for the Azure Files component in Apache Camel means that it will flatten the file path, stripping any leading paths so only the file name remains. This allows you to consume recursively into sub-directories, but when writing files to another directory, they will be written in a single directory instead of maintaining their original directory structure. The original file names from CamelFileName header will also have any leading paths removed if this option is set to true. By default, the "flatten" option is set to false.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and purpose of the "jailStartingDirectory" option in the Apache Camel Azure Files component, and can it be turned off to allow writing files outside the starting directory?'
      answer: |
       'The "jailStartingDirectory" option in the Apache Camel Azure Files component is designed to restrict writing of files only to the starting directory (and subdirectories) by default. This feature, which serves to enhance security, prevents Camel from writing files outside these directories, thereby securing it out-of-the-box. However, you can choose to disable this behavior if needed, allowing Camel to write files to directories outside the starting directory, such as parent or root folders. The default value for this option is true, meaning it is enabled by default.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, and required status of the ''tempFileName'' option in the Apache Camel component ''azure-files'', and how does its location relate to the final file location specified in the ''fileName'' option?'
      answer: |
       'In the Azure Files component of Apache Camel, the ''tempFileName'' option provides a more granular control over the naming of temporary files being generated. Unlike the ''tempPrefix'' option, it uses the File Language for naming conventions. The temporary filename''s location is relative to the final file location specified in the ''fileName'' option, not the target directory in the base URI. For instance, if ''fileName'' includes a directory prefix (e.g., dir/finalFilename), then ''tempFileName'' is determined relative to that subdirectory ''dir''. It doesn''t have a default value and its use is optional, belonging to the ''producer'' group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel `tempPrefix` option in the `azure-files` component, and why might it be useful to set a value for this option when working with big files using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The `tempPrefix` option in the Azure Files component of Apache Camel is designed to facilitate writing large files more efficiently. By writing the file initially under a temporary name, followed by renaming it to its final name once writing is complete, this option allows for the identification of files being written and prevents consumers (not using exclusive read locks) from reading in-progress files. This feature is particularly useful when working with big files, as it helps avoid potential issues due to simultaneous access, ensuring data integrity.'
    - question: 'What is the default value of the "allowNullBody" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files", and what happens when a null body is sent to the file component if this option is set to true or false? Furthermore, how does the "fileExist" option behave in relation to the "allowNullBody" option when it is set to ''Override'' or ''Append''?'
      answer: |
       'The default value of the "allowNullBody" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files" is false. If a null body is sent to the file component when this option is set to true, an empty file will be created. However, if it''s set to false and a null body is sent, a GenericFileWriteException with the message ''Cannot write null body to file.'' will be thrown. The "fileExist" option determines what happens when a file already exists at the specified location. If set to ''Override'', the file will be truncated (i.e., its content will be deleted and a new empty file will be created), while if set to append, the file will remain unchanged. Therefore, when "allowNullBody" is true, an empty file will be created regardless of the "fileExist" option value; but if "allowNullBody" is false, a GenericFileWriteException will be thrown regardless of the "fileExist" option value. The "producer (advanced)" group includes these advanced options for customizing the behavior of the azure-files component in Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the Apache Camel component "azure-files" option named "disconnectOnBatchComplete", and under which producer group is it categorized as an advanced option?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "disconnectOnBatchComplete" option in the Azure Files component of Apache Camel is false. This option determines whether to disconnect from the remote FTP server immediately after a Batch upload completes. It only affects the current connection to the FTP server, not any other connections. This advanced option falls under the "producer (advanced)" group in the Camel producer category.'
    - question: 'Given the provided information about the Apache Camel `azure-files` component''s `eagerDeleteTargetFile` option, here''s a question that can be answered using it:              "What is the default behavior of the ''eagerDeleteTargetFile'' option in the Apache Camel azure-files component when using fileExists=Override and tempFileName options? Specifically, does it delete the existing target file eagerly before writing the temp file or does it only delete the target file just before renaming the temp file to the target filename?"'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the ''eagerDeleteTargetFile'' option in the Apache Camel `azure-files` component, when using the options `fileExists=Override` and `tempFileName`, is to delete the existing target file eagerly before writing the temp file. However, it can be configured to only delete the target file just before renaming the temp file to the target filename by setting the option to false.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "keepLastModified" option in the Apache Camel "azure-files" component, and under what circumstances can this option be used with a file producer, but not with any FTP producers?'
      answer: |
       'The "keepLastModified" option within the Apache Camel "azure-files" component is intended to preserve the last modified timestamp of the source file (if available). It utilizes the FileConstants.FILE_LAST_MODIFIED header to locate this timestamp, which can be either a java.util.Date or a long value representing a timestamp. If both the timestamp exists and the "keepLastModified" option is enabled, it sets this timestamp on the written file. Important to note that this option is applicable only with the file producer; you cannot use it with any FTP producers. This advanced setting falls under the "producer (advanced)" group in the configuration. By default, the "keepLastModified" option is set to false.'
    - question: 'How does the lazyStartProducer option in the Apache Camel component azure-files affect the startup behavior of a route, and why might it be beneficial to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component Azure Files allows you to defer the startup of the producer until the first message is processed. This can be beneficial when a producer may otherwise fail during the initial startup, preventing the route from starting successfully. By setting lazyStartProducer to true, you enable the route to start without encountering this potential failure. Instead, any errors related to the producer''s startup will be handled via Camel''s routing error handlers during message processing.              However, please note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some additional time, which could prolong the total processing time of the route. You should consider this trade-off when deciding whether to use this option based on your application''s requirements. The lazyStartProducer option falls under the "producer (advanced)" group in CamelContext configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the ''moveExistingFileStrategy'' option in the Apache Camel Azure Files component, and how can a custom strategy be implemented for this option when using it for file production (advanced group)?'
      answer: |
       'The ''moveExistingFileStrategy'' option in the Apache Camel Azure Files component does not have a default behavior; if no custom strategy is provided, the component uses its own default implementation. However, if you wish to implement a custom strategy for file production (advanced group), you can do so by providing an appropriate object when configuring this option. This custom strategy will be used to move files with special naming tokens when ''fileExist=Move'' is configured.'

      answer: |
       'To enable automatic creation of missing directories in the file pathname while using the Azure Files component in Apache Camel, you can configure the "autoCreate" option to true. This setting allows both file consumers and producers to create the necessary directories as needed. The default value for this option is already set to true, so if you prefer this behavior, no additional configuration is required. Keep in mind that this option falls under the "advanced" group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "connectTimeout" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files", and can it be considered as a mandatory configuration parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The "connectTimeout" option in the Azure Files component of Apache Camel has a default value of 10000 (in milliseconds). It is of type "duration". Although not required, it''s considered an advanced configuration parameter as it sets the timeout for waiting to establish a connection, which can be used by both FTPClient and JSCH.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the ''maximumReconnectAttempts'' option within the Azure Files component in Apache Camel, and can it be set to disable reconnection attempts altogether?'
      answer: |
       'The ''maximumReconnectAttempts'' option in the Azure Files component of Apache Camel specifies the maximum number of reconnection attempts Camel performs when trying to connect to a remote FTP server. By default, this value is null, meaning no specific limit is set. You can configure it as an integer to define the number of retry attempts. If you wish to disable reconnection attempts altogether, you can set its value to 0. This option falls under the ''advanced'' group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "reconnectDelay" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files", and can this option be marked as required?

    - question: 'How does changing the value of the "throwExceptionOnConnectFailed" option in the Apache Camel Azure Files component affect the behavior when a connection failure occurs? And, what is the default value of this option and how can I enable it to throw an exception instead of logging a warning?'
      answer: |
       'Changing the value of the "throwExceptionOnConnectFailed" option in the Apache Camel Azure Files component governs the behavior when a connection failure occurs. By default, this option is set to false, meaning that an exception isn''t thrown but instead, a warning is logged. If you want to enable the option so that an exception is thrown and can be handled within the `org.apache.camel.spi.PollingConsumerPollStrategy rollback` method, you should set its value to true. This will allow you to handle connection failure exceptions more explicitly in your application. Keep in mind that this setting falls under the "advanced" group of options, which means it may not be necessary for basic usage scenarios.'

This option is used exclusively by the FTPClient when using this component, but it doesn''t require the full FTP client functionality to be enabled. The data type for this option is "duration." Lastly, this configuration option belongs to the "advanced" groups in the context of the Azure Files component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "antExclude" option in the Apache Camel''s "azure-files" component, and how can multiple exclusions be specified using this option? Also, does it have a default value and is its use mandatory?'
      answer: |
       'The "antExclude" option in the Azure Files component of Apache Camel serves as an Ant-style filter for file exclusion. If both "antInclude" and "antExclude" are used, "antExclude" takes precedence over "antInclude". Multiple exclusions can be specified using the "antExclude" option by listing them in a comma-delimited format (e.g., "folder1/*.txt,folder2/"). The use of this option is not mandatory as indicated by its default value being null.'
    - question: 'How does one configure the Apache Camel''s Azure Files component to disable the case sensitivity for the Ant Filter, if it is currently set to its default value (true)?'
      answer: |
       'To disable the case sensitivity for the Ant Filter in the Apache Camel''s Azure Files component when it is currently set to its default value (true), you can set the "antFilterCaseSensitive" option to false. This can be done by modifying your configuration as follows:              ```       from("azure-files:...")           .filter().antInclude("*", true)           .filter().antExclude("**/*.txt", true) // Note that the antFilterCaseSensitive option is applied here           .setHeader(exchange).simple("${body}")           ...       ;       ```              In this example, when you set `"antFilterCaseSensitive": false`, Camel will no longer consider case sensitivity for filtering files:              ```       from("azure-files:...")           .filter().antInclude("*", true)           .filter().antExclude("**/*.txt", false) // Disable case sensitivity by setting antFilterCaseSensitive to false           .setHeader(exchange).simple("${body}")           ...       ;       ```'

    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel component "azure-files" option named "eagerMaxMessagesPerPoll", and what happens when it is set to true or false, considering its memory usage implications?'
      answer: |
       'The Azure Files component for Apache Camel offers an option called "eagerMaxMessagesPerPoll". This option controls whether the limit from maxMessagesPerPoll is applied during the scanning of files (when set to true) or after all files have been scanned and sorted (when set to false). When set to true, it allows for a more efficient polling process at the cost of potential messages being processed out of order. However, when set to false, it enables sorting all files first in memory, ensuring messages are processed in order but requiring higher memory usage due to the storage of file details.'
    - question: 'How can I properly use the "exclude" option in the Apache Camel''s Azure Files component to exclude files matching a specific regex pattern while configuring an endpoint URI, considering that symbols such as plus sign might require RAW() syntax?'
      answer: |
       'To utilize the "exclude" option in Apache Camel''s Azure Files component effectively, you should apply a case-insensitive regular expression (regex) pattern to exclude specific files from processing while configuring an endpoint URI. If your regex includes symbols like the plus sign, you might need to configure this using the RAW() syntax when defining the endpoint URI. For more details regarding configuring endpoint URIs with RAW(), please refer to the documentation provided.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the option "excludeExt" in the Apache Camel azure-files component, and how can you specify multiple extensions to exclude when using this option? Additionally, can you explain where the file extension in a file name is located and why it might be necessary to use the include/exclude options instead of excludeExt for greater flexibility?'
      answer: |
       'The "excludeExt" option in the Apache Camel azure-files component is used to exclude files that match specific case-insensitive file extension names. To exclude multiple extensions, separate them with commas. For instance, if you want to exclude both ''bak'' and ''dat'' files, use the command: `excludeExt=bak,dat`.              The file extension in a filename is located at the end, following the last dot (.). For example, in the file name "mydata.tar.gz", the extension is "tar.gz".              For greater flexibility in filtering files, it might be necessary to use the include/exclude options instead of excludeExt. This allows for more complex and customizable filtering based on various criteria, rather than just file extensions.'

    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "filterDirectory" option in the Apache Camel''s "azure-files" component and how can you use a simple date pattern to filter the directory based on the current date?'
      answer: |
       'The "filterDirectory" option within the Azure Files component in Apache Camel serves the purpose of filtering the directory based on a Simple language pattern. To filter the directory based on the current date, you can utilize a simple date pattern such as ${date:now:yyyMMdd}. This will apply a filter that only selects files with the specified format (in this case, YYYYMMDD), where YYYY represents the four-digit year, MM the two-digit month, and MMDD the two-digit day of the month. It''s worth noting that the use of "filterDirectory" is optional, as components may not always require filtering.'
    - question: 'What is the correct format for using the Apache Camel `filterFile` option in the `azure-files` component to filter files based on their size, specifically those greater than or equal to 5000 bytes?'
      answer: |
       'To use the `filterFile` option in the `azure-files` component of Apache Camel for filtering files based on their size (specifically greater than or equal to 5000 bytes), you should set it to `${file:size} 5000`. This syntax employs Simple language, where `${file:size}` is the expression used to access file properties and ''5000'' specifies the minimum size in bytes for the files to be filtered.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "idempotent" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files" function to prevent processing duplicate files, and what is its default value? Additionally, can you explain when it is recommended to set this option to true and how it uses an LRUCache for this purpose?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "idempotent" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files" allows the Idempotent Consumer Endpoint Pattern to be used, which helps skip already processed files. This feature is particularly useful when you want to ensure that no file gets processed more than once due to errors or system failures. When set to its default value of false, it does not utilize this functionality. If you set "noop=true", the idempotent option will be enabled, preventing the same files from being processed repeatedly.              The Idempotent Consumer EIP pattern employs an LRUCache (Least Recently Used Cache), which by default holds 1000 entries. This cache keeps track of the recently processed files, allowing Camel to identify and skip duplicates as they are encountered again in the processing pipeline. By doing so, it helps improve overall system performance and reliability. It is recommended to set this option to true when you want to ensure data consistency and avoid redundant processing in your Azure Files-based integration scenarios.'

    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "maxMessagesPerPoll" option in the Apache Camel Azure Files component, how can its value impact the processing of files when polling, and what are the potential consequences if this option is not set or its value is less than zero?'
      answer: |
       'The "maxMessagesPerPoll" option in the Apache Camel Azure Files component serves to define a maximum number of messages (files) to gather during each poll operation. If no maximum is specified, no limit will be set by default. This option can help avoid overwhelming your server with thousands of files when starting up, especially if you have a large number of files in your Azure File Share.              When you set a value for "maxMessagesPerPoll", such as 1000, only the first 1000 files will be picked up during each polling cycle. Then, these files will be sorted before further processing. If this option is not set or its value is less than zero, no limit will be applied when gathering messages, which could potentially lead to excessive resource consumption and slower performance.              It''s important to note that if "maxMessagesPerPoll" is in use, the File and FTP components will limit their operations before any sorting takes place. However, you can mitigate this by using the "eagerMaxMessagesPerPoll" option and setting it to false, which allows all files to be scanned first and then sorted afterwards.'

    - question: 'What is the default and possible values for the `exclusiveReadLockStrategy` option in the Apache Camel component named `azure-files`, and what type of object does it represent, if any?'
      answer: |
       'The `exclusiveReadLockStrategy` option in the Azure Files component of Apache Camel is an optional object that represents a pluggable read-lock strategy. It can be implemented as org.apache.camel.component.file.GenericFileExclusiveReadLockStrategy. By default, it does not have a value assigned (defaultValue: null). If you wish to configure this option, you may do so within the "lock" groups when setting up your Camel route.'
    - question: 'What are the available strategies for the "readLock" option in the Apache Camel''s Azure Files component, and how do they differ in terms of reliability, performance, and compatibility with clustered mode? Also, could you explain when it would be appropriate to use each strategy?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel''s Azure Files component, the "readLock" option provides several strategies for acquiring exclusive read access to a file before processing:              1. none - No read lock is used. This is the default and offers no guarantees about the file state.       2. markerFile - A marker file (fileName.camelLock) is created, providing a simple, close-to-atomic operation for acquiring the lock. However, this approach may not be reliable in clustered mode due to potential conflicts when multiple consumers are accessing the same shared file system.       3. changed - This strategy uses file length/modification timestamp to detect whether the file is currently being copied or not. It provides reasonable reliability and can be more reliable than markerFile, but it may have performance implications as it needs at least 1 second to determine if a file is locked. It''s important to note that this option cannot consume files as fast as the others due to the check frequency.       4. fileLock - This strategy uses java.nio.channels.FileLock and should be avoided when accessing a remote file system via a mount/share unless that file system supports distributed file locks, as it may not work well in clustered mode.       5. rename - This strategy tries to rename the file as a test to check if an exclusive read-lock can be acquired. It''s useful when you want to avoid potential conflicts in clustered mode, but its performance may be affected, especially when dealing with large files.       6. idempotent - (only for file component) This strategy uses an idempotentRepository as the read-lock, allowing for use of read locks that support clustering if the idempotent repository implementation supports clustering. Examples of idempotent repositories include Hazelcast Component or Infinispan.       7. idempotent-changed - (only for file component) This strategy combines an idempotentRepository and changed as the read-lock, providing similar benefits to using idempotent alone but with additional checks to ensure the file has not been modified since the lock was acquired.       8. idempotent-rename - (only for file component) This strategy combines an idempotentRepository and rename as the read-lock, offering similar benefits to using the rename strategy but with the added advantage of supporting clustering if the idempotent repository implementation supports that.              When deciding which read lock strategy to use, consider factors such as performance, reliability, compatibility with your specific environment (e.g., remote file systems and clustered mode), and the requirements of your use case. For example, if you are working in a clustered environment, it would be more appropriate to use one of the idempotent read lock strategies or idempotent-changed/idempotent-rename for better reliability and compatibility with clustering. On the other hand, if performance is crucial and your file system supports distributed locks, using the fileLock strategy might be beneficial.'
    - question: 'How does increasing the value of the "readLockCheckInterval" option in the Apache Camel azure-files component affect the behavior of acquiring read locks, and what is the recommended rule of thumb for setting the "readLockTimeout" value relative to the "readLockCheckInterval"?'
      answer: |
       'Increasing the value of the "readLockCheckInterval" option in the Apache Camel azure-files component increases the time between attempts to acquire a read lock. This is particularly useful when using a changed read lock, as it allows more time for slow writes to complete before the lock is acquired. The default value is 1000 milliseconds (1 second), but if your producer (writer) is slow, you might want to consider increasing this interval.              For FTP, the default "readLockCheckInterval" is set at 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds). It''s important to note that the "readLockTimeout" value should always be higher than the "readLockCheckInterval". As a rule of thumb, it''s recommended to set the "readLockTimeout" at least 2 or more times the duration of the "readLockCheckInterval", ensuring ample time is allowed for the read lock process to attempt grabbing the lock before the timeout is hit. This helps guarantee that the read-lock mechanism has sufficient time to function effectively without timing out prematurely.'
    - question: 'How does setting the "readLockDeleteOrphanLockFiles" option in the Apache Camel component Azure-Files to false affect the behavior of picking up orphaned lock files, and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "readLockDeleteOrphanLockFiles" option in the Apache Camel component Azure-Files to false will prevent it from deleting any orphaned read lock files upon startup. If an orphaned lock file exists, Camel will not attempt to pick up that file. This could potentially cause issues if another node is concurrently reading files from the same shared directory. However, if left at its default value (true), the component will delete any such orphaned lock files during startup, ensuring a clean and efficient operation.'
    - question: 'What is the default log level used when a read lock could not be acquired using the Azure Files component in Apache Camel, and how can I change this log level for specific situations? Also, under which circumstances would changing the readLockLoggingLevel option be applicable?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Azure Files within Apache Camel, the default log level when a read lock could not be acquired is "DEBUG". If you wish to modify this behavior in specific situations, you can change the log level by adjusting the "readLockLoggingLevel" option. For instance, you can set it to "OFF" if you don''t want any logging in such cases. It''s important to note that this option is only applicable for read locks of types: changed, fileLock, idempotent, idempotent-changed, idempotent-rename, and rename. Changing the readLockLoggingLevel would be applicable when you want to customize the logging level for these particular read lock scenarios.'
    - question: 'In the context of using the Apache Camel Azure Files component, why is it set by default that a marker file will be used as a lock mechanism for reading files and how can this behavior be adjusted or disabled?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the Apache Camel Azure Files component, a marker file is employed by default as a lock mechanism when reading files. This is to ensure that multiple processes don''t simultaneously pick up the same files, potentially leading to inconsistencies. If you wish to avoid writing marker files to your file systems by the Camel application, you can adjust this behavior by setting the "readLockMarkerFile" option to false in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''readLockMinAge'' option in the Apache Camel Azure Files component, and under what condition is it applied? Also, is this option required when configuring the Azure Files component, and can you provide an example usage scenario for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The ''readLockMinAge'' option in the Apache Camel Azure Files component is designed to optimize the read lock process by specifying a minimum age a file must be before attempting to acquire the read lock. This can speed up the changed read lock as it will only attempt to acquire files which are at least that given age. For instance, setting readLockMinAge=300s would require the file to be at least 5 minutes old. The default value for this option is 0, meaning no minimum age is set by default. This option can be applied only when ''readLock'' is set to ''changed''. It''s important to note that while not required, setting an appropriate readLockMinAge value can help improve the performance of your file access operations within the Azure Files component.              As for an example usage scenario, let''s consider a batch processing job where files are written to an Azure File Share and then processed one by one. To ensure that a file is not being processed concurrently while other jobs might be writing to it, you could set readLock=changed and readLockMinAge=300s in your Camel configuration. This way, the processing job will only attempt to acquire the read lock for files that are at least 5 minutes old, giving time for any writes to complete and ensuring data consistency.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "readLockMinLength" option in the Apache Camel azure-files component and what is its default value, as well as any conditions under which it may be required to set this option to zero?'
      answer: |
       'The "readLockMinLength" option in the Azure Files component of Apache Camel is designed to be used alongside the "readLock=changed" setting. It allows you to configure a minimum file length for read operations. By default, Camel assumes that files contain data and sets the minimum length to 1. However, if you need to process zero-length files, you can set this option to zero. This condition might arise when dealing with files that do not contain any data but still require processing for other reasons.'
    - question: 'How does the "readLockRemoveOnCommit" option in the Apache Camel component Azure-Files behave when set to true, and what is its default value when not explicitly specified?'
      answer: |
       'When you set the "readLockRemoveOnCommit" option in the Apache Camel component Azure-Files to true, it indicates that the file name entry from the idempotent repository will be removed upon successful processing of the file and a commit occurs. This setting is applicable only when readLock=idempotent. However, by default, the file is not removed, ensuring no race conditions occur as another active node may attempt to grab the file later. If this option is not explicitly specified, its default value is false.'
    - question: 'Here''s a question that can be answered based on the provided information:              "What is the default behavior of the ''readLockRemoveOnRollback'' option in the Apache Camel component ''azure-files'', and under what circumstances will this behavior occur if the ''readLock'' option is set to ''idempotent''?"'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the ''readLockRemoveOnRollback'' option in the Azure Files component for Apache Camel is true. This means that when processing a file fails and a rollback happens, the file name entry will be removed from the idempotent repository if the ''readLock'' option is set to ''idempotent''. If this option is set to false, the file name entry will be confirmed (as if the file did a commit) during rollback.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "readLockTimeout" option in the Apache Camel''s azure-files component, its default value, and what are the recommended considerations when setting it?'
      answer: |
       'The "readLockTimeout" option in Apache Camel''s azure-files component is an optional setting that specifies a timeout duration, in milliseconds, for acquiring a read lock on a file. If the read lock cannot be obtained within this timeframe due to contention or other issues, Camel will skip the file and retry it during the next poll. The default value for this option is 10000 (or 10 seconds).              When setting the "readLockTimeout", it''s recommended to consider the rule of thumb that its value should be at least 2 or more times higher than the readLockCheckInterval, to ensure ample time is allowed for the read lock process to try to acquire the lock before the timeout is hit. Additionally, keep in mind that for FTP, the default readLockTimeout value is 20000 instead of 10000.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Azure Files component of Apache Camel, and can it be configured as an integer value without being required?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Azure Files component of Apache Camel is a configuration setting that specifies the number of subsequent errors (polls that fail due to some error) before the backoffMultiplier should become active. By default, it has no preset value, allowing you to set it according to your specific use case. It can be configured as an integer value, and although not required, setting this option can provide a mechanism for retrying failed operations with a sensible delay after several errors have occurred within the threshold you define.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Azure Files component, and is it required or optional? (Answer: The backoffIdleThreshold option in Azure Files component of Apache Camel specifies the number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler kicks-in. It has no default value and is an optional setting under the scheduler group.)'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Azure Files component of Apache Camel is an optional setting within the scheduler group, which specifies the number of subsequent idle polls that should occur before the backoffMultiplier kicks-in. This value is not set by default.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "backoffMultiplier" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files", and under what conditions should it be configured along with "backoffIdleThreshold" and/or "backoffErrorThreshold"? Also, what is the default value for "backoffMultiplier", and can it be considered as a required configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffMultiplier" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files" serves to allow the scheduled polling consumer to pause if a specific number of consecutive idle or error events occur. This multiplier indicates the number of skipped polls before the next attempt is made again, effectively creating a backoff mechanism. When using this option, it is essential to also configure "backoffIdleThreshold" and/or "backoffErrorThreshold" as these parameters define the conditions under which the consumer should idle or fail. The default value for "backoffMultiplier" is null, meaning it does not have a predefined value, and its configuration is optional but recommended where handling retry scenarios in the context of the scheduler group is necessary.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it''s a mandatory option for the "delay" attribute in the "azure-files" component of Apache Camel''s scheduler group, if it exists?'
      answer: |
       'The "delay" attribute in the "azure-files" component of Apache Camel''s scheduler group is an optional setting, which specifies the number of milliseconds before the next poll. Its default value is 500 (half a second), and it accepts integer values as data type.'
    - question: 'Given the provided information about the Apache Camel component azure-files and its option "greedy", what is the purpose of enabling the greedy option in the context of scheduling polling and how does its default value affect this behavior?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "greedy" option in the Azure Files component within Apache Camel, when used with a ScheduledPollConsumer, means that if the previous run polled one or more messages, the consumer will trigger another round of polling immediately. This behavior can be useful for real-time data processing scenarios where you want to process new messages as soon as they arrive. By default, this option is set to false, meaning it does not automatically execute another round of polling after processing a message. However, if you find that your application requires real-time processing of Azure Files, you can set the "greedy" option to true for such functionality.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the optional configuration parameter "initialDelay" in the Apache Camel component named "azure-files"? Also, under which group of options does this parameter belong?'

    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "repeatCount" option in the Apache Camel component "azure-files", and under what circumstances will it cause the scheduler to fire continuously?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of the Apache Camel component "azure-files," the "repeatCount" option specifies a maximum limit for the number of times an action is repeated. If you set it to a positive integer, such as 1 or 5, the scheduler will only fire that number of times. For instance, if you set it to 5, it will execute five times. A value of zero or negative indicates that the action should fire indefinitely, meaning it will continue firing without limit. To summarize, the default value for "repeatCount" is 0, and this option will cause the scheduler to fire continuously only when a non-positive integer is provided.'
    - question: 'What is the default logging level for the "start/complete" log lines generated by the Azure Files component in Apache Camel, when using the "runLoggingLevel" option for consumer logs, and what options are available to configure this logging level beyond its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The default logging level for the "start/complete" log lines generated by the Azure Files component in Apache Camel, when using the "runLoggingLevel" option for consumer logs, is TRACE. You can configure the logging level beyond its default value by specifying a different log level such as DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, or FATAL. These options will control the verbosity of the log messages generated during the polling process. This configuration is useful if you want to fine-tune the amount and type of information that gets logged for improved debugging and monitoring purposes.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom or shared thread pool for an Azure Files component in Apache Camel using the scheduledExecutorService option, and is it mandatory to provide such a configuration?'

If you prefer to manually control the starting of the scheduler, you can change this setting; however, since automatic starting is optional, it''s not necessary to set the `startScheduler` option unless you wish to override the default behavior.'
    - question: 'What is the default time unit for the "initialDelay" and "delay" options in the Azure Files component of Apache Camel, and can the "timeUnit" option be omitted if it has a specific default value?'
      answer: |
       'In the Azure Files component of Apache Camel, the default time unit for both the "initialDelay" and "delay" options is MILLISECONDS. This means that the values specified for these options are interpreted as milliseconds. However, it''s important to note that while the "timeUnit" option is not required in the configuration, you can explicitly specify it if needed, for clarity or to use a different time unit (such as SECONDS or MINUTES).'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and possible alternative of the "useFixedDelay" option under the Apache Camel azure-files component, and can it be configured to run without being required? (Hint: It''s a boolean value.)'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the "useFixedDelay" option in the Azure Files component of Apache Camel is set to true, which means that fixed delay is used. However, you can alternatively set it to false if you prefer fixed rate. This option relates to the ScheduledExecutorService in JDK, where it determines whether a fixed delay or fixed rate will be applied between tasks.
