    - question: 'What is the method or way to use a shared configuration in the Apache Camel olingo2 component, if the user does not want to provide their own configuration object? The provided information suggests that there might be an option for using a shared configuration, but it does not have a default value.'
      answer: |
       'To utilize a shared configuration with the Apache Camel Olingo2 component, follow these steps:              1. Ensure that the desired shared configuration object is available within your project scope.              2. In your route or processor configuration where the Olingo2 component is being used, do not explicitly set the configuration property. Since the provided information indicates that there''s an option for using a shared configuration but it has no default value, you don''t need to provide any value for this property.              3. The Olingo2 component will automatically pick up the shared configuration object from your project scope if it is accessible within the current context.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and maximum allowable range for the connectTimeout option in Apache Camel''s olingo2 component, and can it be set as a required configuration parameter? (Answer: The default value is 30,000 milliseconds (or 30 seconds), and it can be set as an optional configuration parameter.)'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s olingo2 component, the connectTimeout option has a default value of 30,000 milliseconds (30 seconds) for HTTP connection creation timeout. This value is changeable, but it can also be left as an optional configuration parameter since it has a default setting. The maximum allowable range for this option is not explicitly specified in the provided information.'
    - question: 'What is the default Content-Type header value for messages sent using the Apache Camel olingo2 component and when is it possible to specify a different format?'
      answer: |
       'The default Content-Type header value for messages sent using the Apache Camel olingo2 component is `application/json;charset=utf-8`. However, you can specify a different message format, such as XML, by setting the "Content-Type" header value accordingly. This option is available but not required, and it falls under the common group of settings in the component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "entityProviderReadProperties" option in the Apache Camel olingo2 component, and is it a required setting?'
      answer: |
       'The "entityProviderReadProperties" option in the Apache Camel olingo2 component is an optional setting that allows you to apply custom properties to all read operations. By default, this option has no value assigned to it, meaning it does not affect these operations when set to null. This setting can be found under the common group of options within the component''s configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "entityProviderWriteProperties" option in the Apache Camel component Olingo2, and under what circumstances would it be beneficial to use this option instead of the serviceUri configuration parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The "entityProviderWriteProperties" option in the Apache Camel component Olingo2 allows for customizing certain properties when executing create, update, patch, batch, and merge operations. These properties can include skipping the Json object wrapper or enabling content-only mode when sending request data. However, it''s important to note that a service URI set in these properties will always be overwritten by the serviceUri configuration parameter.              Using "entityProviderWriteProperties" could be beneficial when you need more flexible control over the request data sent to the OData service beyond what the serviceUri configuration parameter offers. For instance, if you want to customize how your data is serialized or transmitted, this option provides a way to do so. But, as mentioned, it''s advisable to use the serviceUri configuration parameter instead whenever possible, to ensure consistency and avoid potential conflicts.'
    - question: 'How does setting the "filterAlreadySeen" option in the Apache Camel olingo2 component impact the processing of data, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "filterAlreadySeen" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component to true will filter out results that have already been communicated by this component during the current processing cycle. This can help prevent duplicate data from being processed unintentionally. However, it''s important to note that its default value is false, meaning duplicates are not filtered out by default in the component''s behavior.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "httpHeaders" option in the Apache Camel component "olingo2", and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "httpHeaders" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component is designed to allow you to inject custom HTTP headers into every request made by this component. This can include tokens like OAuth, among other things. By default, no value (null) is set for this option, which means you have to provide your own headers if needed. The usage of "httpHeaders" is optional and it falls under the common group of configuration options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, and whether it''s required for the Apache Camel component olingo2 option named "proxy" in terms of its role in configuring an HTTP proxy server?'
      answer: |
       'The option "proxy" for the Apache Camel OLingo2 component is an object that allows configuration for an HTTP proxy server. It does not have a default value, meaning you must provide values specific to your proxy server when using this option. Whether it''s required depends on your use case; if you need to use an HTTP proxy server, then it is necessary to configure this option accordingly.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "serviceUri" option in the Apache Camel olingo2 component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceUri" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component is designed to specify the base URI of your target OData service. A common example would be http://services.odata.org/OData/OData.svc. It accepts string values as input and has no default value (defaultValue: null). This option is optional, meaning it''s not required in every use case to provide this parameter when configuring the Olingo2 component.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the optional Apache Camel olingo2 component configuration option named ''socketTimeout'', and what unit is it measured in?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional Apache Camel Olingo2 component configuration option ''socketTimeout'' is an integer of 30,000 (units: milliseconds).'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel olingo2 component handle exceptions thrown during message consumption, and can we configure it to bridge these exceptions to the Camel routing Error Handler using the `bridgeErrorHandler` option?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel olingo2 component typically handles exceptions that occur during message consumption by logging them at WARN or ERROR level and ignoring them. However, you can configure it to bridge these exceptions to the Camel routing Error Handler using the `bridgeErrorHandler` option. This allows any exceptions thrown while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages to be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.              Please note that this is only possible if the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. If the component handles exceptions internally, bridgeErrorHandler is not an option. In some scenarios, we may improve the Camel component to hook into the 3rd party component and make this configuration possible for future releases. By default, the consumer will use the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler` to deal with exceptions.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the "splitResult" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component for consumer endpoints that receive arrays or collections, and can this behavior be changed if needed?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "splitResult" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component for consumer endpoints that receive arrays or collections is to map each element as a distinct message. However, if you want to change this behavior, you can set the "splitResult" option to false.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of setting the Apache Camel olingo2 component''s "lazyStartProducer" option to true or false, and what potential impact could it have on the overall processing time of messages?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel olingo2 component determines whether the producer should be started lazily (on the first message). When set to true, the producer will start only when the first message is processed, allowing the CamelContext and routes to startup even if a producer may otherwise fail during starting. This can help handle startup failures that might cause the route not to start. However, it''s important to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some time, which could prolong the total processing time of the messages. Conversely, if set to false, the producer will start immediately during CamelContext startup, potentially causing issues if the producer fails to start, but ensuring quicker overall processing of messages once the route is active.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component, and can it be left as its default value when configuring this component?'
      answer: |
       'The ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component is a boolean setting that determines whether autowiring is enabled for automatic configuration of various services such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, etc. The default value is true, meaning autowiring is enabled by default. If you''re configuring this component and are comfortable with auto-configuration, you can leave the ''autowiredEnabled'' option at its default value.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel `olingo2` component''s `httpAsyncClientBuilder` option and what configuration properties can be adjusted using it, including any default values or requirements?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel `olingo2` component''s `httpAsyncClientBuilder` option serves as a custom HTTP async client builder for more intricate HTTP client configuration. It allows you to override connectionTimeout, socketTimeout, proxy, and sslContext. It is crucial to specify a socketTimeout in the builder as OData requests might block indefinitely otherwise. The default value for this option is not set (null). This option falls under the "advanced" group of configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "httpClientBuilder" option in the Apache Camel component olingo2 and what configuration settings can be customized using this option, as well as whether it is required or has a default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "httpClientBuilder" option in the Apache Camel component Olingo2 serves to provide a custom HTTP client builder for complex HTTP client configurations. This allows you to override settings like connectionTimeout, socketTimeout, proxy, and sslContext. It is essential to specify a socketTimeout within the builder as OData requests could potentially block indefinitely otherwise. The "httpClientBuilder" option is not required, meaning it can be used or skipped at your discretion, and it does not have a default value. This feature falls under the advanced group of configurations in Olingo2.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel olingo2 component to use SSL security with custom SSLContextParameters, given that SSLContextParameters is an optional configuration for security?'
      answer: |
       'To configure Apache Camel''s olingo2 component to utilize SSL security with your custom SSLContextParameters, you can follow these steps:              1. Create an object for SSLContextParameters as per your requirements. This object should contain all the necessary properties such as truststore, keystore, and their respective passwords if needed.              2. When setting up the olingo2 component configuration, include the SSLContextParameters object in the options under the "sslContextParameters" key. For example:              ```javascript       from("olingo2://yourEndpoint")           .configuration()               .property("sslContextParameters", yourSSLContextParametersObject) // Include your custom SSLContextParameters here           .end();       ```              3. Since SSLContextParameters is an optional configuration for security, you can choose whether or not to include it in the configuration based on your use case requirements. If not specified, the component will use its default settings for SSL security.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "useGlobalSslContextParameters" option in the Apache Camel olingo2 component impact its behavior, and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "useGlobalSslContextParameters" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component allows it to utilize global SSL context parameters. This means that instead of defining SSL context settings on a per-connection basis, they can be set once globally and applied to all connections. The default value for this option is false, meaning that individual connection settings will be used if not overridden by the use of this global setting.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "connectTimeout" option for the Apache Camel olingo2 component, and can it be set as a requirement during its configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "connectTimeout" option in the Apache Camel olingo2 component is an integer 30,000 (30 seconds), which signifies the HTTP connection creation timeout in milliseconds. It can be set as a requirement during its configuration, but it''s optional, meaning it''s not strictly required to have it set when configuring the component.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Content-Type header value when using the olingo2 component in Apache Camel to specify a JSON or XML message format, and what is the default value for this option if I do not provide it explicitly?'
      answer: |
       'The Content-Type header value can be configured when utilizing the olingo2 component in Apache Camel to specify either JSON or XML message formats. The default value for this option is application/json;charset=utf-8, meaning that if you do not provide it explicitly, the component will use this setting. You can modify the Content-Type by setting the "contentType" option accordingly within your Camel configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "entityProviderReadProperties" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "entityProviderReadProperties" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component is an optional configuration that allows you to apply custom properties to all read operations. By default, it has no value (null). This feature enables fine-tuning of read operations according to specific use cases and requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "entityProviderWriteProperties" option in the Apache Camel olingo2 component, and are there any specific scenarios where it might be necessary to use this option instead of the "serviceUri" configuration parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The "entityProviderWriteProperties" option in the Apache Camel olingo2 component is designed to allow customization of entity provider write properties during create, update, patch, batch, and merge operations. These properties can enable features like skipping the Json object wrapper or enabling content-only mode when sending request data. However, it''s important to note that a service URI set in these properties will always be overwritten by the "serviceUri" configuration parameter.              While using the "entityProviderWriteProperties" option is not necessary in most cases due to the preference for using the "serviceUri" parameter, there might be specific scenarios where it could prove useful. For instance, if you have complex requirements that cannot be met solely with the "serviceUri" configuration, you may need to use this option to customize your entity provider behavior accordingly.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "filterAlreadySeen" option in the Apache Camel olingo2 component, and what is its default value? Can you also explain when it might be useful to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "filterAlreadySeen" option in the Apache Camel olingo2 component is designed to filter out results that have already been communicated by this component. Its default value is false. This option can be particularly useful when you want to prevent the same data from being processed multiple times, ensuring that only new data gets through for further processing in your workflow. Setting it to true may help reduce redundancy and optimize performance.'
    - question: 'How can I set custom HTTP headers in each request for the Apache Camel Olingo2 component, and is it mandatory to provide values for these headers? (Assuming that this component doesn''t have a default value for custom HTTP headers.)'
      answer: |
       'To set custom HTTP headers in every request for the Apache Camel Olingo2 component, you can configure the "httpHeaders" option. This allows you to inject your own headers, such as OAuth tokens, into each request. However, providing values for these headers is not mandatory; if no value is provided, the default value will be null. You can find this configuration under the "common" group of options in the component''s settings.'
    - question: 'How do you set the name of a parameter to be passed as the body in an Apache Camel exchange using the Olingo2 component, and is it required? Is there a default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'To set the name of a parameter to be passed as the In Body in an Apache Camel exchange using the Olingo2 component, you can use the "option": "inBody" with the desired parameter name under the "component": "olingo2". This is not a required option and it doesn''t have a default value. You can specify a string as the value for this option to denote the name of the parameter to be sent in the exchange body. This setting belongs to the group "common" in Olingo2 component configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and the purpose of the "proxy" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component, and is its use optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxy" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component is an HTTP proxy server configuration. Its default value is null, meaning no default proxy is set. The purpose of this option is to allow you to configure a proxy server when making HTTP requests with the Olingo2 component. Its use is optional, not required.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "serviceUri" option in the Apache Camel component called olingo2, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceUri" option in the Apache Camel component called Olingo2 serves as the target base URI for your OData service. By default, it has no value assigned (defaultValue: null). Its usage is optional; you don''t necessarily need to provide a value for this option when working with the Olingo2 component. The group in which this option can be found is called "common".'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the Apache Camel olingo2 component''s socketTimeout option, and can it be configured as a required setting? Based on the provided information, the default value of the socketTimeout option in the Apache Camel olingo2 component is an integer with a default value of 30,000 (30 seconds). It can also be configured, but it''s not a required setting since the "required" field in the given details is set to false.'
      answer: |
       'The default data type of the socketTimeout option in the Apache Camel olingo2 component is an integer with a default value of 30,000 milliseconds (equivalent to 30 seconds). It can be configured, but it''s not a required setting since the "required" field in the provided information is set to false.'
    - question: 'Can you explain the function of the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option within the Apache Camel Olingo2 component and under what circumstances it would be useful to enable this option for a consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component is designed to manage how idle polling consumers behave when they don''t find any files to process during their scheduled polling interval. When this option is enabled, an empty message (no body) will be sent instead of nothing at all. This can be useful if you want your consumer to maintain a regular heartbeat with the upstream system even when it doesn''t have any data to process, thereby helping to ensure consistent communication and potentially avoiding timeouts or other issues due to idle periods. However, it''s important to note that this option is not required and its default value is false, meaning that no empty message will be sent if it remains unchanged.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior for the Apache Camel olingo2 component''s "splitResult" option when consuming data from an endpoint that returns an array or collection, and can this behavior be changed?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the Apache Camel olingo2 component''s "splitResult" option is to map each element of an array or collection from a consumer endpoint as distinct messages. However, this behavior can be altered by setting the "splitResult" option to false when consuming data from an endpoint that returns an array or collection.'
    - question: 'How does the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel olingo2 component function, and when is it beneficial to set it to true instead of relying on the default ExceptionHandler?'
      answer: |
       'The `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel''s olingo2 component allows for connecting the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions (if supported by the third-party component) that occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages will be treated as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.              Setting `bridgeErrorHandler` to true can be beneficial when you want a more customized error handling strategy for exceptions that might arise during message consumption, rather than relying on the default ExceptionHandler which logs exceptions at WARN or ERROR level and ignores them. It''s essential to note that this feature is only possible if the third-party component allows Camel to be alerted when an exception was thrown; otherwise, it may not be supported.              Moreover, in future releases, there might be improvements to the Camel component to hook into third-party components and make `bridgeErrorHandler` possible for more scenarios. The `consumer (advanced)` group of configurations includes this option for advanced users looking to customize their consumer''s behavior.'
    - question: 'What custom ExceptionHandler can be used with the Apache Camel Olingo2 component, if the user wants to handle exceptions individually instead of the default behavior of logging at WARN or ERROR level and ignoring them? And what settings should be considered when using this option?'
      answer: |
       'To utilize a custom ExceptionHandler with the Apache Camel Olingo2 component, you can configure the "exceptionHandler" option under the consumer settings, labeled as "advanced" group. If the bridgeErrorHandler is disabled, this option will be in effect. Note that when this option is selected, the default behavior of handling exceptions by logging at WARN or ERROR level and ignoring them will no longer apply. Instead, you can implement your own exception handling logic within the provided custom ExceptionHandler.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component, and under which group of options is it considered optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component is an optional setting (grouped under the "consumer (advanced)" category). Its purpose is to define the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange, but it does not have a default value. This means you must explicitly specify the exchange pattern when using this option in your integration solutions.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component, and what is its purpose in controlling the error handling during poll operations before an Exchange has been created and routed in Camel? Also, can you explain where this option belongs in terms of required or optional settings, and which group it belongs to among available groups for this component?'
      answer: |
       'The `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component is a customizable strategy that allows error handling during poll operations before an Exchange has been created and routed in Camel. By default, it does not have a specific value (defaultValue: null). This option is considered optional as indicated by the "required": false attribute. It belongs to the consumer (advanced) group among the available options for this component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and effects of setting the "lazyStartProducer" option to true in an Apache Camel route using the olingo2 component, considering factors like potential startup failures, routing error handlers, prolonged processing time, and its default value?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "lazyStartProducer" option to true in an Apache Camel route using the olingo2 component allows for a more graceful startup of your CamelContext and routes, particularly when dealing with producers that may fail during the initial starting process. This lazy start approach postpones the creation and initialization of the producer until the first message is processed.              In situations where a producer might otherwise cause a route to fail being started due to errors, this lazy startup enables those errors to be handled through Camel''s routing error handlers during message processing instead. This can help improve the overall stability and reliability of your routes.              However, it is important to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take a little extra time, which could potentially prolong the total processing time of the route. Therefore, consider the tradeoff between startup reliability and potential performance impacts when deciding whether to use this option.              By default, the "lazyStartProducer" option is set to false in Apache Camel routes. If you decide to use it, ensure that you are aware of its implications and have a strategy in place for handling any error scenarios that may arise during message processing.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "httpAsyncClientBuilder" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component and what configuration options does it provide for more complex HTTP client setup, specifically regarding connection timeout, socket timeout, proxy, and SSL context? Also, is it mandatory to specify a socketTimeout in the builder when using this option? If so, why could OData requests block indefinitely otherwise?'
      answer: |
       'The "httpAsyncClientBuilder" option in Apache Camel''s Olingo2 component serves as a custom HTTP async client builder, allowing for more intricate configurations of the HTTP client setup. It provides options to override connection timeout, socket timeout, proxy settings, and SSL context. It is essential to specify a socketTimeout in the builder for this option, as failure to do so could result in OData requests potentially blocking indefinitely due to an unlimited socket timeout, causing potential issues with resource consumption or application responsiveness.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "httpClientBuilder" option in the Apache Camel component "olingo2", and what configuration options does it provide for advanced HTTP client setup, specifically regarding connection timeout, socket timeout, proxy, and SSL context? Also, does it have a default value and is its usage considered optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'The "httpClientBuilder" option in the Apache Camel component "olingo2" serves for advanced configuration of HTTP clients, allowing for more complex setups that override connectionTimeout, socketTimeout, proxy, and SSLContext. Notably, a socketTimeout must be explicitly specified within this builder to avoid OData requests from blocking indefinitely. This option does not have a default value and its usage is considered optional, falling under the "advanced" group of configuration settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component, and is its usage associated with any specific group or configuration in the scheduler?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffErrorThreshold" option within the Apache Camel Olingo2 component is designed to define the number of subsequent error polls (failures due to errors) that should occur before the "backoffMultiplier" should take effect. By default, this value is not set ("defaultValue": null). Its usage is associated with the scheduler configuration, specifically within the group named "scheduler".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component when used with the scheduler group, and can it be left as null or must it have a specific integer value?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffIdleThreshold" option within the Apache Camel Olingo2 component, when associated with the scheduler group, determines the number of consecutive idle polls that should occur before the "backoffMultipler" takes effect. This option is an integer but it has a default value of null, meaning it can be left unspecified if desired. However, if set, it should be assigned a specific integer value representing the number of times the component waits without response (idle polls) before increasing the backoff duration for subsequent polls.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "backoffMultiplier" option in the Apache Camel olingo2 component, when should it be used, and what type of value does it expect? Also, can you explain how it interacts with other related options such as "backoffIdleThreshold" and "backoffErrorThreshold", and under which configuration group is this option found?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffMultiplier" option in the Apache Camel olingo2 component is designed to enable a scheduled polling consumer to temporarily halt operation if there has been a certain number of consecutive idle or error events. This value represents the number of polls that will be skipped before the next attempt is made again, allowing the system to recover from potential issues.              When using this option, it''s essential to also configure the "backoffIdleThreshold" and/or "backoffErrorThreshold" options to define the specific conditions under which a backoff should occur (either due to idleness or errors).              The "backoffMultiplier" expects an integer type of value. This indicates the number of skipped polls, as aforementioned.              This set of related options can be found within the "scheduler" configuration group in the Apache Camel olingo2 component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it''s required for the "delay" option in the Apache Camel olingo2 component, and under which group settings this option can be found in the scheduler?'
      answer: |
       'The "delay" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component is designed to specify the number of milliseconds before the next poll. By default, it is set to 500 milliseconds. This option is not mandatory as its usage can be skipped if not required. The data type for this option is "integer". The group under which you can find and adjust this setting is within the scheduler settings.'
    - question: 'What is the behavior of the Apache Camel olingo2 component''s "greedy" option when enabled in relation to the ScheduledPollConsumer, and under what circumstances will it cause the consumer to run immediately again?'
      answer: |
       'When you enable the "greedy" option on the Apache Camel Olingo2 component, it modifies the behavior of the ScheduledPollConsumer. Specifically, if a previous run of the consumer polled one or more messages, then this option will cause the consumer to execute immediately again. This means that if new messages are available in your endpoint, they will be processed more quickly because the consumer will not wait for the scheduled interval to elapse before running again. However, it''s important to note that this option is optional and its default value is false, meaning that the ScheduledPollConsumer will operate as normal unless explicitly set to true.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel olingo2 component, and is it required when configuring this component? (Answer: The default value is 1000 milliseconds, and it is an integer. It is not required when configuring this component.)'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel Olingo2 component, the "initialDelay" option has a default value of 1000 milliseconds (or one second) and it''s an integer data type. This option specifies the number of milliseconds before the first poll starts, but it is not required when configuring this component.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and possible maximum limit for the number of fires when using the "repeatCount" option in Apache Camel''s olingo2 component, if it is not explicitly specified? Also, could you explain how this option affects the scheduler in terms of its firing pattern?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the number of fires when using the "repeatCount" option in Apache Camel''s olingo2 component is unlimited (defaultValue: 0). This means that if you do not explicitly specify a value for repeatCount, the scheduler will fire indefinitely. However, if you set a specific value for repeatCount, it will limit the number of times the scheduler fires. For instance, setting it to 1 would allow the scheduler to fire once, while a value of 5 would allow it to fire five times. If you want the scheduler to fire forever without any limit, you can set its value to zero or leave it unspecified.'
    - question: 'What is the default logging level for the "start/complete" logging in the Apache Camel olingo2 component, and which logging levels can be configured if a custom level is desired, considering that this option belongs to the scheduler group?'
      answer: |
       'The default logging level for the "start/complete" logging in the Apache Camel olingo2 component is TRACE. If you desire a custom logging level, the available options include ALL (for all logs), DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL. Since this option belongs to the scheduler group, ensure that your configuration applies to the scheduler settings for appropriate monitoring of polling events.'
    - question: 'How can you configure a custom or shared thread pool using the scheduledExecutorService option in the Apache Camel olingo2 component, and is it required when not configured?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom or shared thread pool using the `scheduledExecutorService` option in the Apache Camel `olingo2` component, you can set your preferred settings within an object. This allows for fine-tuning the thread management for the consumer. By default, each consumer employs an individual single-threaded thread pool, but if you wish to use a custom or shared one, this is where you make those adjustments. If not configured, each consumer will continue to operate independently with its single-threaded thread pool, as indicated by the "required": false within the component''s documentation under the "scheduler" group.'
    - question: 'What is the default value of the "scheduler" option in the Apache Camel olingo2 component and how can it be configured to use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "scheduler" option in the Apache Camel olingo2 component is none. To configure it to use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz component, you should provide the respective values, i.e., "spring" or "quartz". These built-in schedulers will allow you to schedule your tasks based on a cron expression or other supported scheduling mechanisms.'
    - question: 'What are the valid properties that can be configured in the "schedulerProperties" option for the Apache Camel component named olingo2 when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz, Spring-based schedulers? And is it mandatory to provide values for these properties if I don''t want to use a custom scheduler?'
      answer: |
       'The "schedulerProperties" option for the Apache Camel component named olingo2 allows you to configure additional properties when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz, Spring-based schedulers. These properties are an object type and their use is optional. If you do not wish to use a custom scheduler, it is not mandatory to provide values for these properties.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and requirement status for the option "startScheduler" within the Apache Camel component named "olingo2", and can this option be considered part of the scheduler group?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the option "startScheduler" in the Apache Camel component "olingo2" is true, meaning it is set to auto-start the scheduler. This option is not required, as it can be false if you want to manually start the scheduler. Yes, this option belongs to the scheduler group due to its connection with the scheduling functionality of the component.'
    - question: 'What is the default data type or time unit for the "timeUnit" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component, specifically when it is used with the "initialDelay" and "delay" options within the scheduler group? And if not provided, what would be its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The default data type or time unit for the "timeUnit" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component, when used with the "initialDelay" and "delay" options within the scheduler group, is MILLISECONDS. If not provided explicitly, it defaults to this value.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component, and can its usage be considered optional? Additionally, could you explain what the difference is between fixed delay and fixed rate when using this option, and where to find more details about it in the JDK?'
      answer: |
       'The "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component controls whether a fixed delay or fixed rate is used for scheduling tasks. By default, it''s set to true, meaning a fixed delay is employed. This option can be found under the "scheduler" group. Its usage isn''t required, but setting it can help manage task execution intervals more effectively.              In terms of differences, a fixed delay refers to the time between task executions where each delay is based on the completion of the previous task. On the other hand, a fixed rate implies that new tasks are scheduled with an exact interval of time regardless of whether the previous task has completed or not.              For more details about ScheduledExecutorService in JDK, which provides the basis for this option, you can refer to the Java API documentation. Specifically, look into the Executors class and its methods offering solutions for scheduled tasks, such as ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor and Timer.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and whether it''s required to use the "sslContextParameters" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component for configuring security using SSLContextParameters? And what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "sslContextParameters" option in the Apache Camel Olingo2 component is used to configure security when employing SSLContextParameters. Its use is not mandatory, as denoted by the "required: false". When configuring security using SSLContextParameters, you may choose to include this option, but its default value is null. This means you will need to provide your own SSLContextParameters object for secure communication if you decide to utilize it in your application.'
