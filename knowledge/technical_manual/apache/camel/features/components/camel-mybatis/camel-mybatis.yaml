seed_examples:
    - question: 'What is the default location and data type of the MyBatis configurationUri option in an Apache Camel route, if it''s not explicitly defined, and is its specification optional within a route?'
      answer: |
       'In an Apache Camel route, when the MyBatis configurationUri option isn''t explicitly defined, its default value is "SqlMapConfig.xml" loaded from the classpath. The data type for this option is "string", and it''s specified under the "common" group. So, it''s not mandatory to define the location of the MyBatis xml configuration file within a route.'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel MyBatis component''s "bridgeErrorHandler" option function, and why might it not be possible for every MyBatis instance to utilize this feature?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component allows for integrating exceptions that occur while the MyBatis consumer is attempting to retrieve incoming messages with the Camel routing Error Handler. This means any exceptions will now be processed as a message and managed by the routing Error Handler. However, it''s important to note that this feature isn''t available for all MyBatis instances; only those that allow Camel to receive notification if an exception was thrown can leverage it. Some third-party components may handle exceptions internally and don''t provide the ability for Camel to hook into them, preventing the use of bridgeErrorHandler. If you find your specific MyBatis instance doesn''t support this option, by default, the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler, logging any errors at WARN or ERROR level and discarding them.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `lazyStartProducer` option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component to true affect the startup behavior and potential performance of a Camel route compared to when it is set to false?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `lazyStartProducer` option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component to true allows for deferred producer startup upon the first message processing. This approach enables the route to successfully start even when a producer may otherwise fail during initialization, thus making it more resilient to such issues.              However, it is crucial to be aware that the initial message processing time might increase slightly due to the creation and starting of the producer at runtime. On the other hand, when `lazyStartProducer` is set to false, the producer is started along with the route startup, potentially resulting in a faster initial processing time.              In summary, using lazy startup (true) can help ensure route availability in challenging scenarios, while it may cause a slight increase in processing time during the first message processing. Meanwhile, non-lazy startup (false) offers faster initial processing at the expense of increased likelihood of failure due to producer issues during route initialization.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and potential uses of the ''autowiredEnabled'' option within the Apache Camel component ''mybatis'', and under what conditions can this feature be manually disabled?'
      answer: |
       'The ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component is a boolean configuration set to true by default, indicating that autowiring is enabled. This means automatic wiring of components can occur when there''s a single matching instance type in the registry. It''s useful for configuring various resources such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, and more within your MyBatis integration. If manual configuration is preferred or if multiple instances of a component are needed, you can manually disable autowiring by setting ''autowiredEnabled'' to false under the "advanced" group in your Camel configuration settings.'
    - question: '"In regards to the Apache Camel MyBatis component, what is the purpose of setting the ''sqlSessionFactory'' option when using it, and is it required or optional?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''sqlSessionFactory'' option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component serves to configure an instance of SqlSessionFactory. This allows you to execute SQL statements with the help of maps for query parameters. Its usage is entirely optional within the context of using the MyBatis component; it falls under the advanced group, so it might not be required if you are just getting started with Camel or MyBatis.'
    - question: 'Given the provided information about the Apache Camel "mybatis" component option called "healthCheckConsumerEnabled", a question could be:              What is the default value of enabling or disabling all consumer based health checks from the Apache Camel "mybatis" component, and under what group configuration can this setting be modified (if it is not required)?              Answer: The default value for disabling all consumer-based health checks within the Apache Camel "mybatis" component is true. This setting can be found under the ''health'' configuration group in the Camel XML or Java DSL if you decide to modify it from its default value.'
      answer: |
       'The default value for enabling or disabling all consumer-based health checks within the Apache Camel "mybatis" component is true. This setting can be modified under the ''health'' configuration group in the Camel XML or Java DSL. If you wish to alter it, simply locate this setting within the ''health'' configuration group and adjust accordingly.'
    - question: 'How do you configure the Apache Camel mybatis component''s healthCheckProducerEnabled option to enable or disable all producer-based health checks from this component, and what is its default value if not explicitly set?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the "mybatis" component''s healthCheckProducerEnabled option in Apache Camel, you can set it to true if you wish to enable all producer-based health checks from this component. Note that by default, Camel has disabled all producer based health-checks. You can turn on producer checks globally by setting `camel.health.producersEnabled=true`. If the healthCheckProducerEnabled option is not explicitly set, its default value is true.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the maximum number of messages delivered in a single exchange using the "maxMessagesPerPoll" option with the Apache Camel Mybatis component, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the maximum number of messages delivered in a single exchange using the "maxMessagesPerPoll" option with the Apache Camel MyBatis component, you can set an integer value for this option. By default, there is no maximum limit set, but you can customize it as needed, for example, to a maximum of 1000 messages. To disable it, set a value of 0 or negative. This option belongs to the consumer group in configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "onConsume" option for the Apache Camel MyBatis component, and is it required?'
      answer: |
       'The "onConsume" option for the Apache Camel MyBatis component is a string value that specifies a statement to run after the data has been processed within the route. This option allows you to execute additional SQL statements for specific purposes such as logging, validation, or any custom processing after data consumption. The default value of this option is null, meaning no automatic execution of a statement is set initially. Lastly, it''s optional as indicated by "required:false", which means you can use the MyBatis component without setting this option.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the Apache Camel MyBatis component''s routeEmptyResultSet option, and is it possible to configure this option to allow empty resultsets to be routed to the next hop in a Camel route?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the Apache Camel MyBatis component''s `routeEmptyResultSet` option is set to false, meaning that an empty resultset does not get routed to the next hop in a Camel route. However, this setting can be configured as necessary, allowing you to adjust whether or not empty resultsets will be routed to the following step.'
    - question: 'Can you explain when and why the Apache Camel Mybatis component''s `sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle` option should be set to true for a consumer?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the Apache Camel Mybatis component, setting the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option to true is recommended when your polling consumer does not regularly find any files to process during its idle periods. By enabling this feature, you instruct the component to send an empty message (with no body) instead of waiting idly for new files, thus improving efficiency and reducing potential delays in communication within your integration system. However, it''s important to note that the default value is false, meaning that it''s not required, but can be useful depending on how you have designed your consumer setup in your use case. This option falls under the consumer group configuration settings for the MyBatis component.'
    - question: 'Here is a question related to the Apache Camel MyBatis "transacted" option:              Can you explain the purpose of the transacted option in the MyBatis component of Apache Camel and how it affects the behavior when processing exchanges in a consumer route? Also, can you describe the default value and whether or not it is required for use?'
      answer: |
       'The "transacted" option in the MyBatis component of Apache Camel serves to manage transactional behavior during exchange processing within a consumer route. If set to true, it enables transactions, meaning that if any processing of an exchange fails, it will cause the consumer to terminate further processing of subsequent exchanges, leading to a rollback (undoing any database changes made since the start of the transaction). This option helps maintain data consistency when working with multiple database operations within a single transaction. The default value for this option is false, meaning transactions are not enabled by default. While not required, enabling this option can provide additional control and reliability in your consumer routes that involve database operations.'
    - question: 'Given the documentation of the Apache Camel MyBatis component, specifically the "useIterator" option which allows setting whether to process the MyBatis ResultSet as individual records (false) or as a list (true), and knowing that it defaults to true:              If I were to write a question about this, it would be: What is the default behavior when using the ''useIterator'' option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component for processing the result set, and is it possible to change this behavior?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior when using the ''useIterator'' option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component is to process the ResultSet as a list (true). However, it is possible to change this behavior by explicitly setting ''useIterator'' to false if you prefer to process individual records instead.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component facilitate error handling, compared to the default exception handling mechanism used when it''s disabled?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component significantly enhances error handling compared to the default exception handling mechanism. When enabled, any exceptions that may occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages will be treated as messages and managed by the routing Error Handler. This offers a more robust method for handling errors, as it allows for custom processing of errors rather than simple logging at WARN or ERROR level and ignoring them as in the default behavior. However, it''s important to note that not all third-party components support this functionality, as some may handle exceptions internally without allowing Camel to be alerted. In such cases, the bridgeErrorHandler option may not be applicable. For future releases, there is potential for improvements in the Camel component to interface with these third-party components and make bridging error handling a more universal feature.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom ExceptionHandler for the Apache Camel MyBatis component when using it as a consumer, specifically in an advanced configuration setting? And if the bridgeErrorHandler is enabled, does this option become inactive by default, and how are exceptions handled?'
      answer: |
       'In your Apache Camel MyBatis configuration, to use a custom ExceptionHandler, you can leverage the "exceptionHandler" option. When you set this option, it allows your application to utilize a personalized ExceptionHandler.              Please note that if the "bridgeErrorHandler" is enabled, then the "exceptionHandler" becomes inactive by default, as the bridgeErrorHandler will manage the exceptions at the WARN or ERROR level, ignoring them instead of propagating them.              In an advanced configuration setting like "consumer," you can add the exceptionHandler option to your MyBatis component if you wish to override its behavior when handling exceptions:              ```xml       <mybatisConsumer consumerProperties="exceptionHandler=#myCustomExceptionHandler">           <!-- other properties and components -->       </mybatisConsumer>       ```              In the above example, replace "#myCustomExceptionHandler" with an instance of your custom ExceptionHandler. This allows you to implement a strategy that suits your specific use case when dealing with exceptions.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of setting the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component, and what is its default value? Can you also mention if it is considered a required option for consumers using this component and if it belongs to any specific group (e.g., ''consumer'' or ''advanced'')?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component sets the type of message exchange when the consumer creates an Exchange. Its default value is null, meaning it inherits from the Endpoint''s exchange pattern. This option is not a required one for consumers utilizing this component but belongs to the ''consumer (advanced)'' group, indicating it might be more relevant for advanced users or specific use-cases.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "pollStrategy" option for the Apache Camel MyBatis component, and when is it required to provide a custom implementation for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "pollStrategy" option for the Apache Camel MyBatis component is an optional attribute that allows you to supply a custom implementation of `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy`. This strategy controls error handling during poll operation stages, before an Exchange (message) is created and routed in Camel. By default, there is no default value for the "pollStrategy" option; however, providing a custom implementation is not always required. The group under which this option falls is ''consumer (advanced)'', implying it might be more relevant for advanced use cases or when specific error handling strategies are needed during poll operations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''processingStrategy'' option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component, and can its usage be considered as an advanced feature? Also, under what group does this option belong according to the given information?'
      answer: |
       'The ''processingStrategy'' option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component is designed for using a custom MyBatisProcessingStrategy. By default, it does not have a preset value (defaultValue: null). Its usage can indeed be considered as an advanced feature due to its specificity and the need for deeper knowledge of both Camel and MyBatis. According to the given information, this option belongs to the ''consumer (advanced)'' group in the context of Camel components.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and available options for the "executorType" option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component, and what is its default value when not specified?'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s MyBatis component, the "executorType" option refers to the type of executor to be utilized while executing statements. The available options are SIMPLE, REUSE, and BATCH. When set to SIMPLE, the executor performs no special actions. The REUSE executor reuses prepared statements. On the other hand, the BATCH executor not only reuses statements but also batches updates for improved performance. Its default value is SIMPLE when not specified. This configuration is applicable within the "producer" group.'
    - question: 'Here''s a question that can be answered using the provided information:              What is the purpose of the "inputHeader" option in the Apache Camel Mybatis component and when should it be set to a non-null value? Furthermore, how does setting outputHeader affect the input parameters, and what is the default value for inputHeader?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel MyBatis component, the "inputHeader" option is utilized when you want to use the header value for input parameters instead of the message body. By default, it''s set to null and the input parameters are derived from the message body. However, if you set "outputHeader" to a non-null value, the input parameters will be taken from the header instead of the body. Keep in mind that when outputHeader is set, the inputHeader''s default value remains null.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `outputHeader` option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component affect the storage of query results and the content of the message body?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `outputHeader` option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component allows for the storage of the query result within a message header instead of the message body. By default, the query result is stored in the message body, with any existing content in the message body discarded. However, if you set `outputHeader`, the specified value will be used as the name of the header to store the query result, thereby preserving the original contents of the message body. Additionally, setting outputHeader omits populating the default CamelMyBatisResult header since it would be redundant given the use of `outputHeader`.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "statementType" option in the Apache Camel Mybatis component, and is it required when using a producer?'
      answer: |
       'The "statementType" option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component is intended to specify the type of operation that should be invoked by the producer, making it mandatory for the producer to function correctly. However, this option has no default value, meaning it needs to be explicitly set when using a producer with the MyBatis component.'
    - question: 'Here is a question that can be answered with the provided information:              "What does the ''lazyStartProducer'' option for the Apache Camel MyBatis component do, and what are its benefits and drawbacks in terms of startup time and potential failures during route initialization?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''lazyStartProducer'' option for the Apache Camel MyBatis component allows you to defer the initiation of the producer during the CamelContext and routes startup process. This lazy startup can be beneficial in scenarios where the initialization of the producer may otherwise lead to a failure, causing the entire route to fail being started.              The primary advantage is that by starting the producer lazily, you can utilize Camel''s routing error handlers to manage and recover from such startup failures without affecting the overall success of the route initializing process. However, it is essential to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may require additional time compared to immediately starting the producer during route initialization, potentially extending the total processing time of the CamelContext.              On the other hand, the drawback of using this option is that it could lead to slightly longer initial response times for messages as the producer is only created and started when the first message arrives. Additionally, any potential delays associated with creating and starting the producer should be taken into account when designing the error handling and resilience strategies for your Camel application.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `backoffErrorThreshold` option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component affect its behavior when encountering errors during polling, and what is its default value or whether it''s required when using the scheduler group?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `backoffErrorThreshold` option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component controls the number of consecutive errors that occur during polling before the backoffMultiplier should kick-in, increasing the time between subsequent retries to help mitigate issues caused by temporary failures. Its default value is not specified; therefore, you can set it according to your application''s error handling requirements. When using the scheduler group, setting `backoffErrorThreshold` is optional, so you can choose whether or not to configure it depending on your specific use case and error tolerance needs.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the "backoffIdleThreshold" option within the Apache Camel MyBatis component, if set, and under what context is it used, considering its group belongs to the scheduler?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffIdleThreshold" option within the Apache Camel MyBatis component is a configurable setting that specifies the number of idle polls (queries without results) before the backoffMultiplier kicks in. This means if an operation does not return any results for a certain number of times, it will gradually slow down (back off) to reduce load on the system. The default value for this option is null, meaning it can be set manually by the user. It''s essential to understand that "backoffIdleThreshold" falls under the group "scheduler", which deals with managing periodic or scheduled jobs in Camel. In the context of MyBatis, it helps control the rate at which idle polls occur when working with databases, contributing to better performance and system optimization.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "backoffMultiplier" option within the Apache Camel MyBatis component for a scheduled polling consumer, and what integer values can it take when set, if not provided by default? Also, under which group configuration can we find this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffMultiplier" option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component is used to instigate a backoff strategy for your scheduled polling consumer. When there are a sequence of idle or error occurrences, it allows the consumer to skip a specific number of polls before attempting again. This value is an integer that represents the number of skipped polls before resuming attempts. If not provided by default, it accepts any positive integer value. You can configure this option under the "scheduler" group within your configuration settings. Keep in mind that when using "backoffMultiplier", you should also specify values for "backoffIdleThreshold" and/or "backoffErrorThreshold".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, type, and whether it''s required for the "delay" option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component under the scheduler group, if provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "delay" option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component, when provided (as it''s optional), determines the milliseconds before the next poll. Its default value is 500, meaning there will be a delay of half a second before each subsequent poll if no value is explicitly specified. The type of this option is integer. It belongs to the scheduler group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the function of the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component when used with the ScheduledPollConsumer, and what is its default value and whether it''s required to be set?'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s MyBatis component, the "greedy" option, when enabled with the ScheduledPollConsumer, causes the consumer to run immediately again if the previous run polled one or more messages. Its default value is false, meaning it will not run immediately unless explicitly set to true. However, setting it is optional as you can control the scheduling behavior according to your application''s needs under the "scheduler" configuration group.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel mybatis component when using its scheduler group, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component, when utilized within the scheduler group, has a default value of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) and belongs to the integer data type. It''s an optional setting, meaning that providing it is not mandatory for the correct functioning of the MyBatis component in your Camel application.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "repeatCount" option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component when used with a scheduler, and can this setting be left as its default value if we want the processor to run repeatedly without any limit?'
      answer: |
       'The "repeatCount" option in the Apache Camel MyBatis component, when used with a scheduler, specifies a maximum limit for the number of times the processor can be fired. If you set it to 1, the processor will only fire once; if you set it to 5, it will run five times. A value of zero or negative means the processor will continue to fire indefinitely (or "forever"). Therefore, leaving the default value (0) for the "repeatCount" option implies that the processor will keep running without any limit, providing repeated execution if you wish to do so without setting a specific count.'
    - question: 'What is the default logging level for the Camel MyBatis component''s "runLoggingLevel" option, and which groups of users can configure it if desired?'
      answer: |
       'The default logging level for the "runLoggingLevel" option in the Camel MyBatis component is TRACE. If desired, this setting can be configured by users within the "scheduler" groups as it is an optional property.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom thread pool or shared thread pool for the Apache Camel MyBatis component using the scheduledExecutorService option, and is it required when not using the scheduler groups?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom or shared thread pool for the Apache Camel MyBatis component, you can make use of the "scheduledExecutorService" option. This allows you to define your own thread pool instead of using the single-threaded thread pool that is set by default for each consumer. Although it''s not mandatory when not employing the "scheduler" groups, having a custom thread pool may provide improved concurrency and resource management in situations where multiple consumers are used concurrently.'
    - question: 'What is the recommended method for implementing a schedule in an Apache Camel route when using the MyBatis component, and are there any default values or group configurations associated with this feature?'
      answer: |
       'To implement a schedule in an Apache Camel route while utilizing the MyBatis component, you can employ either the camel-spring or camel-quartz components that provide a cron scheduler functionality. The value "spring" or "quartz" will initialize the built-in schedulers for each respective component. Please note that there are no default values associated with this feature, and it''s an optional configuration grouped under "scheduler."'
    - question: 'What are the possible options for configuring additional properties when using a custom scheduler with the Apache Camel MyBatis component, if choosing to use optional schedulerProperties? And is there any default value associated with these properties?'
      answer: |
       'When utilizing a custom scheduler in conjunction with the Apache Camel MyBatis component and opting for the use of the "schedulerProperties," you may configure additional properties as needed. These properties serve to accommodate various configurations when using Quartz or Spring-based schedulers. However, it is essential to note that there is no default value associated with these properties.'
    - question: 'Here is a possible question that could be asked about the `startScheduler` option of the Apache Camel MyBatis component based on the provided information:              "What is the default behavior and configuration options for auto-starting the scheduler in the MyBatis component of the Apache Camel routing framework?"'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior in the MyBatis component of Apache Camel''s routing framework regarding the auto-start of the scheduler is that it will be started automatically. This behavior can be configured through an option called `startScheduler`. If you choose not to configure this option, it will retain its default value of true, indicating that the scheduler will run automatically. However, you have the flexibility to modify this setting if required by setting it to false.'
    - question: 'What is the default time unit for the ''initialDelay'' and ''delay'' options in the Apache Camel Mybatis component when the ''timeUnit'' option is not specified? Is there a group of configurations to which this setting pertains, specifically within the scheduler settings?'
      answer: |
       'The default time unit for the ''initialDelay'' and ''delay'' options in the Apache Camel Mybatis component is Milliseconds, when the ''timeUnit'' option is not specified. This setting applies to a specific group of configurations within the component called "scheduler".'
    - question: '"What does the ''useFixedDelay'' option in the Apache Camel Mybatis component do, and what is its default value when not specified?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''useFixedDelay'' option in the Apache Camel Mybatis component controls whether a fixed delay or fixed rate is used for scheduling tasks. If set to true (which is the default), it uses a fixed delay, meaning that the task will wait the specified delay after completion before being executed again. For more details about these concepts, you can refer to ScheduledExecutorService in Java''s JDK documentation. This option falls under the scheduler group and isn''t required to be specified when using the Mybatis component if a specific timing isn''t necessary for your application.'
