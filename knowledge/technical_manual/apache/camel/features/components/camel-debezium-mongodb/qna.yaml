    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "additionalProperties" option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and what format should additional properties be when they need to be set for the Debezium engine (such as setting Kafka Connect properties), including an example of how to set the "transactional.id" and "schema.registry.url" properties?'
      answer: |
       'The "additionalProperties" option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component is designed for adding extra properties that can''t be directly set on the camel configurations. This is particularly useful when setting Kafka Connect properties required by the Debezium engine, such as setting KafkaOffsetBackingStore. To use this feature, you should prefix the properties with "additionalProperties."              For example, to set the "transactional.id" and "schema.registry.url" properties for the Debezium engine, you would format your configuration like this:              ```       additionalProperties.transactional.id=12345       additionalProperties.schema.registry.url=http://localhost:8811/avro       ```'
    - question: 'How does the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component function, and under what conditions is it possible for this option to be set to true?'
      answer: |
       'The `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions (if supported by the component) that occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages will be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.              However, this functionality is only possible if the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. Some components handle exceptions internally, in which case `bridgeErrorHandler` cannot be set to true. In situations where this isn''t supported, efforts are being made to improve the Camel component to hook into the 3rd party component and make this possible for future releases.              By default, if the consumer encounters an exception, it will use the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler` to deal with exceptions, which will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. The `bridgeErrorHandler` is an optional configuration, with a default value of false.'
    - question: 'What are the possible configurations available for the debezium-mongodb component in Apache Camel when using it as a consumer, and is it mandatory to provide these configurations?'
      answer: |
       'The "debezium-mongodb" component in Apache Camel, when used as a consumer, allows optional configurations to be set. These configurations are predefined objects that you can use to customize the behavior of this component. While it is not mandatory to provide these configurations, setting them can help tailor the component''s behavior to your specific needs.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "internalKeyConverter" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component and what Converter class should be used if it''s not set, by default?'
      answer: |
       'The "internalKeyConverter" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component is utilized to handle serialization and deserialization of key data for offset management. By default, the org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter class is used for this purpose. If you choose not to specify a custom Converter, the JSON converter will be employed automatically within the consumer group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "internalValueConverter" option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and what Converter class should be used if a custom Converter other than JSON converter is desired?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of the Apache Camel Debezium MongoDB component, the "internalValueConverter" option serves the purpose of defining the Converter class to handle serialization and deserialization of value data for offsets. By default, this is set to the JSON converter. If you wish to use a custom Converter other than JSON, you can specify the desired Converter class as the value for this option. For instance, if you want to use a different Converter, replace "JSONConverter" with your preferred Converter class in the configuration. Please note that it is optional and if omitted or not specified, it defaults to JSON converter.'
    - question: 'What are the valid Java classes for the offsetCommitPolicy option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component that can be used to customize when offsets commit should be triggered, and what is the default value if this option is not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The valid Java classes for the `offsetCommitPolicy` option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component are those that implement the ''OffsetCommitPolicy'' interface. This allows you to customize when offsets commit should be triggered based on the number of events processed and the time elapsed since the last commit. The default value for this option is a periodic commit policy based upon time intervals, meaning it triggers a commit at regular time intervals rather than based on a specific event count or other conditions. If you choose not to specify a custom offsetCommitPolicy, the default value will be used.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum duration (in milliseconds) that can be set for the option "offsetCommitTimeoutMs" in the Apache Camel Debezium MongoDB component, and what is its default value if it is not specified? Additionally, where does this option belong in terms of the consumer group settings?'
      answer: |
       'The maximum duration that can be set for the option "offsetCommitTimeoutMs" in the Apache Camel Debezium MongoDB component is not explicitly specified in the given information, but it''s a duration type with the default value of 5000 milliseconds (or 5 seconds). This option pertains to the consumer group settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default duration for the `offsetFlushIntervalMs` option in the Apache Camel''s debezium-mongodb component and what purpose does it serve within this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default duration for the `offsetFlushIntervalMs` option in the Apache Camel''s debezium-mongodb component is 60000 milliseconds, which equates to 1 minute. This option determines the interval at which to try committing offsets within this component. Specifically, it specifies how often the component will attempt to commit the current position of data consumption in a MongoDB collection, ensuring that it stays synchronized with the source database.'
    - question: 'What is the default Java class used for the persistence of Debezium MongoDB connector offsets when the option `offsetStorage` is not specified in the configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The default Java class used for the persistence of Debezium MongoDB connector offsets, when the option `offsetStorage` is not explicitly specified in the configuration, is org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.FileOffsetBackingStore.'
    - question: 'What should be the path to a file for storing offsets in Apache Camel''s debezium-mongodb component if the offset.storage is set to the FileOffsetBackingStore?'
      answer: |
       'If you set the offset.storage in Apache Camel''s debezium-mongodb component to the FileOffsetBackingStore, the path to a file for storing offsets should be specified using the option "offsetStorageFileName". The default value is null, but you can provide a custom string value for this option if desired.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the "offsetStoragePartitions" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component, and when is it required? (Hint: This option affects the creation of offset storage topics.)'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStoragePartitions" option within the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component determines the number of partitions used when creating the offset storage topic. This configuration is essential when the offset.storage setting is set to the ''KafkaOffsetBackingStore''. By default, this value is not defined ("defaultValue": null). However, its usage is optional under the "consumer" group of settings. In summary, this option impacts the creation of offset storage topics in your Debezium-MongoDB setup when using Kafka for storing offsets.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "offsetStorageReplicationFactor" option within the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb", and under what circumstances would it be required?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageReplicationFactor" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb" is used to specify the replication factor when creating the offset storage topic. This setting is important when the offset.storage is set to the KafkaOffsetBackingStore. It determines the number of replicas for your Kafka topics, ensuring data redundancy and availability. However, it''s worth noting that the default value for this option is null, meaning no replication factor is applied by default. Therefore, you would only need to set this parameter if you wish to customize the replication factor according to your specific use case or requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "offsetStorageTopic" option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and is it required when using the KafkaOffsetBackingStore?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageTopic" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component is used to specify the name of the Kafka topic where offsets are stored. This is particularly useful when the `offset.storage` is set to the KafkaOffsetBackingStore. However, it''s not a required field, as you can use other methods for storing offsets if preferred. The default value for this option is null, meaning you need to provide a topic name when you want to utilize this feature. This option falls under the "consumer" group in the component''s configuration settings.'
    - question: 'Here''s a question that could be asked about the `autowiredEnabled` option in the Apache Camel `debezium-mongodb` component:              "What is the purpose of the `autowiredEnabled` option in the Apache Camel `debezium-mongodb` component, and what is its default value? Also, is it required for using this component, and under which group of configuration options does it fall?"'
      answer: |
       'The `autowiredEnabled` option in the Apache Camel `debezium-mongodb` component is utilized for enabling or disabling automatic autowiring. When set to true (default value), this option allows Camel to automatically look up and configure an instance of a matching type from the registry if there''s only one available. This can be advantageous when you want to effortlessly configure JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, among other similar options. It is not required for using this component, and it falls under the "advanced" group of configuration options.'
    - question: 'What are the two available options for the ''captureMode'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-mongodb'', and what is the difference between ''change_streams'' and ''change_streams_update_full'' when capturing changes from a MongoDB server? And, does the ''captureMode'' option have a default value? If yes, what is it?'
      answer: |
       'The ''debezium-mongodb'' component in Apache Camel provides two options for capturing changes from a MongoDB server: ''change_streams'' and ''change_streams_update_full''. The ''change_streams'' option allows you to capture changes via MongoDB Change Streams, but the update events do not contain full documents. On the other hand, the ''change_streams_update_full'' (the default) method also captures changes via MongoDB Change Streams, but the update events contain full documents. The ''captureMode'' option has a default value of ''change_streams_update_full''.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the option "collectionExcludeList" in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb", and what is its default value, data type, and whether it''s required or not?'
      answer: |
       'The "collectionExcludeList" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb" can be configured as a comma-separated list of regular expressions or literals that match the collection names for which changes are to be excluded. This configuration is of type string, and its default value is null. It''s important to note that this option is not required, meaning you can choose to exclude certain collections during data replication if needed. The group it belongs to is "mongodb".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''collectionIncludeList'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The ''collectionIncludeList'' option within the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component is used to specify a list of collections for which changes will be captured. This can either be a comma-separated list of regular expressions or simple literals that match the desired collection names. By default, no collections are selected (defaultValue: null). It''s an optional configuration, meaning it''s not required if you want to capture changes from all MongoDB collections.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "converters" option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and how can custom converters be defined and configured for it?'
      answer: |
       'The "converters" option in the Apache Camel Debezium MongoDB component is an optional feature that allows you to use custom converters instead of the default ones provided. These custom converters are used to transform data between Java objects and BSON (Binary JSON) format, which is how MongoDB stores data.              To define and configure custom converters for this component, you can utilize the ''.type'' config option to specify the type of the custom converter, followed by the configuration options using ''.'' notation. For instance, if you choose Jackson2Json as your custom converter, you would use ''.type'' with value "org.apache.camel.dataformat.jackson.JacksonDataFormat" and configure it with necessary options like ''.prettyPrint'', ''.traces'' etc.              It is essential to note that the usage of custom converters is optional since default converters are already provided for basic data transformations. If no custom converter is specified, the component will use the default ones.'
    - question: 'What is the default waiting time in milliseconds and whether it is required for the "cursorMaxAwaitTimeMs" option of the "debezium-mongodb" component in Apache Camel, if it has a group associated with it called "mongodb"?'
      answer: |
       'The default waiting time in milliseconds for the "cursorMaxAwaitTimeMs" option of the "debezium-mongodb" component in Apache Camel is null. It is not required, meaning you can specify a different value if needed, though it belongs to the "mongodb" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "customMetricTags" option in the Apache Camel component named "debezium-mongodb", and what is its default value, type, and whether it is required or not? Also, could you provide an example of how to set custom metric tags for this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "customMetricTags" option in the Apache Camel component named "debezium-mongodb" allows you to customize the MBean object name by accepting key-value pairs. Each key represents a tag for the MBean object name, and the corresponding value is the value of that tag. For instance, if you set `k1=v1,k2=v2`, your MBean object name would be appended with `k1=v1,k2=v2`. This feature is optional, as it has a default value of null and can be found under the "mongodb" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "databaseExcludeList" option in the Apache Camel component Debezium-MongoDB, and is it mandatory or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseExcludeList" option in the Apache Camel component Debezium-MongoDB serves to exclude specific databases from monitoring for changes. It accepts a comma-separated list of regular expressions or literal database names. By default, there is no predefined default value for this option. Lastly, it''s important to note that using ''databaseExcludeList'' is optional; you can choose whether or not to specify databases for exclusion when configuring the Debezium-MongoDB component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "databaseIncludeList" option in the Apache Camel''s debezium-mongodb component, and what type of data should it contain? Is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseIncludeList" option in Apache Camel''s debezium-mongodb component is designed to specify a comma-separated list of database names for which changes are to be captured. This can either be regular expressions or simple literals that match the desired databases. By default, it doesn''t have a value (defaultValue: null). Whether you need to provide this option is optional, as it is marked as "required: false". The data it should contain are database names in string format that are grouped under the "mongodb" category.'
    - question: 'What is the default and maximum value for the "errorsMaxRetries" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb", and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "errorsMaxRetries" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb" is -1, indicating no limit on retries when connection errors occur. The maximum value is not explicitly specified, but since it''s an integer, it can theoretically be quite large. Additionally, this option is optional as it has a false value for the "required" field in its configuration.'
    - question: 'What are the available options for handling failures during processing of events in Apache Camel''s debezium-mongodb component, including the default value and their respective behaviors?'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s Debezium-MongoDB component, there are three available options for handling failures during event processing: ''fail'', ''warn'', and ''ignore''. The default value is ''fail''. When set to ''fail'', an exception indicating the problematic event and its position is raised, causing the connector to stop. With the ''warn'' option, the problematic event and its position are logged and the event will be skipped. Lastly, when set to ''ignore'', the problematic event will be entirely skipped without any logging or exception.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "fieldExcludeList" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "fieldExcludeList" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb" is an optional string parameter that allows you to exclude specific fields from the change event message values. It accepts a comma-separated list of fully-qualified field names. By default, it has no value, meaning all fields will be included unless explicitly excluded. Whether or not you need to provide a value for "fieldExcludeList" when using this component depends on your specific use case and the fields you wish to exclude from the change events.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and description of the "fieldRenames" option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, how can it be configured, what is its default value, and under which group setting does it belong?'
      answer: |
       'The "fieldRenames" option in the Apache Camel Debezium MongoDB component allows for renaming fields within change event message values. It takes a comma-separated list of fully-qualified field replacement rules, where each rule specifies an old name and a new name using the format `databaseName.collectionName.fieldName.nestedFieldName:newNestedFieldName`. Wildcards (`()`) can be used in databaseName and collectionName for matching any characters. The colon character (:``) determines the rename mapping of the field.              This option is configured by providing a string that contains the list of field replacement rules, separated by commas. For example: `myDatabase.myCollection.field1.nestedField1:newNestedFieldName1, myDatabase.myCollection.field2.nestedField2:newNestedFieldName2`.              The default value for this option is null, meaning that no field renaming will be performed if it is not explicitly configured.              Finally, the "fieldRenames" option belongs to the MongoDB group setting in Apache Camel Debezium.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "heartbeatIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and can it be configured to send heartbeat messages periodically if not disabled by default?'
      answer: |
       'The "heartbeatIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium MongoDB component is responsible for defining the interval, in milliseconds, at which the connector sends periodic heartbeat messages to a specified heartbeat topic. By default, this option is set to 0ms, indicating that heartbeat messages are disabled. However, you can configure it to send heartbeats if desired, with non-zero values. If configured, the connector will periodically check its health status and send the heartbeats according to the defined interval. This option falls under the MongoDB group of configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "heartbeatTopicsPrefix" option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and can this option be considered as required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "heartbeatTopicsPrefix" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component is "__debezium-heartbeat". This option is not required when using this component, as it has a default value if left unspecified.'
    - question: 'What are the available strategies for watermarking during an incremental snapshot when using the debezium-mongodb component in Apache Camel, and how do they differ in terms of signaling open and close operations on the signal data collection? (Please include the default value and specify if a strategy is optional or required.)'
      answer: |
       'When working with the debezium-mongodb component in Apache Camel for an incremental snapshot, you have two strategies available for watermarking: ''insert_insert'' and ''insert_delete''.              The default strategy is ''insert_insert'', where both open and close signal is written into the signal data collection. This means that during the incremental snapshot process, both the start (open) and end (close) of a change event are recorded in the signal data collection.              On the other hand, the ''insert_delete'' strategy only writes the open signal on the signal data collection. The close operation will delete the corresponding open signal from the signal data collection at a later time. This approach can help optimize storage and processing by reducing the number of records in the signal data collection over time as changes are applied and committed in the source MongoDB database.              Both strategies are optional, meaning that you can choose to specify one or use the default ''insert_insert'' if you prefer. The choice between these two strategies depends on your specific use case and requirements for data storage and processing.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum number of source records that can be included in a single batch when using the debezium-mongodb component in Apache Camel, and what is its default value if not explicitly set?'
      answer: |
       'The maximum number of source records that can be included in a single batch when using the "debezium-mongodb" component in Apache Camel is determined by the option "maxBatchSize". By default, this setting is set to 2048 records if not explicitly specified.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the maxQueueSize option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and why should it generally be larger than the maximum batch size?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "maxQueueSize" option in the Apache Camel Debezium MongoDB component is 8192. This option sets the maximum size of the queue for change events read from the database log but not yet recorded or forwarded. It''s important to note that this value should generally be larger than the maximum batch size, as it ensures that there is enough capacity in the queue to accommodate the incoming change events, preventing potential overflow situations when a large number of events are generated at once.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "maxQueueSizeInBytes" option for the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb", and is it required when using this component? Furthermore, what does this option control regarding the dequeuing of change events in this context?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "maxQueueSizeInBytes" option for the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb" is 0. This option is not required when using this component, but it controls the maximum size of the queue in bytes for change events read from the MongoDB database log but not yet recorded or forwarded. If set to a value greater than zero, it enables the feature and limits the amount of data that can be buffered before events start being dropped. This helps prevent the system from becoming overwhelmed with large amounts of data and ensures efficient dequeuing of change events in this context.'
    - question: 'What is the optional string value for the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component''s mongodbAuthSource option, which refers to the database containing user credentials, if it is not specified explicitly?'
      answer: |
       'If not specified explicitly, the default string value for the "mongodbAuthsource" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component is "admin".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "mongodbConnectionString" option in the Apache Camel component called "debezium-mongodb", and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "mongodbConnectionString" option in the Apache Camel component named "debezium-mongodb" serves as a database connection string. This connection string establishes a link to your MongoDB instance. The default value for this option is null, meaning you''ll need to provide your own connection string to use this component effectively. It''s an optional parameter, which means you can still use the component without it if you have other means of connecting to your MongoDB database.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and maximum durability for the optional connection timeout parameter "mongodbConnectTimeoutMs" in the Apache Camel component debezium-mongodb? Also, is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional connection timeout parameter "mongodbConnectTimeoutMs" in the Apache Camel component debezium-mongodb is 10 seconds (10,000 ms). The maximum durability for this parameter is not explicitly specified in the provided information. It''s worth noting that providing a value for this option is not mandatory, as it is marked as "required: false" in the configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "mongodbHeartbeatFrequencyMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component, and can it be configured, if so, what are its possible unit options?'
      answer: |
       'The "mongodbHeartbeatFrequencyMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component is a duration that sets the frequency at which the cluster monitor attempts to reach each server. Its default value is 10 seconds (10,000 ms). This option allows you to configure how often the heartbeat occurs, and it can be configured as it has been set to false by default. The possible unit options for this configuration are durations, such as milliseconds (ms), seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h), or days (d).'
    - question: 'What is the required string value for the "mongodbPassword" option in the Apache Camel''s Debezium-MongoDB component when connecting to a MongoDB database? Is it necessary even if no default value is provided and the group associated with this option is "mongodb"?'
      answer: |
       'The "mongodbPassword" option in Apache Camel''s Debezium-MongoDB component is a required string value when connecting to a MongoDB database. This password is utilized for connection purposes if necessary. Even though there is no default value provided, it must be specified as the associated group with this option is "mongodb".'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "mongodbPollIntervalMs" option for the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and is it a required configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "mongodbPollIntervalMs" option for the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component has a default value of 30 seconds (30,000 ms) and its data type is duration. This option is not required for configuration. It determines the interval for looking for new, removed, or changed replica sets within MongoDB.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "mongodbServerSelectionTimeoutMs" option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and can this configuration be considered as a mandatory requirement when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "mongodbServerSelectionTimeoutMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component is of type duration with a default value of 30 seconds (30,000 ms).

    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the optional configuration option "mongodbSocketTimeoutMs" in the Apache Camel''s debezium-mongodb component, and what is its purpose within that context?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional configuration option "mongodbSocketTimeoutMs" in the Apache Camel''s Debezium-MongoDB component is 0ms. This option is of type duration, meaning it expects a value given in milliseconds. Its purpose within that context is to define the socket timeout, which sets the maximum time that a socket operation may take before being considered a failure or timeout. However, it''s important to note that if this option is not provided explicitly, it defaults to 0 ms, indicating an infinite timeout.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and whether it is required for the `mongodbSslEnabled` option in the Apache Camel''s Debezium-MongoDB component, and can this option be used to configure the connector to use SSL when connecting to MongoDB instances?'
      answer: |
       'The `mongodbSslEnabled` option in the Apache Camel''s Debezium-MongoDB component is a boolean type, with its default value being false. This means that by default, the connector does not use SSL to connect to MongoDB instances. However, it''s important to note that this option is not required for configuration; you can choose whether or not to enable SSL when connecting to your MongoDB instances.'
    - question: 'Is it necessary to enable the "mongodbSslInvalidHostnameAllowed" option in the Apache Camel''s Debezium-MongoDB component when using SSL connections, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'No, it''s not necessary to enable the "mongodbSslInvalidHostnameAllowed" option in the Apache Camel''s Debezium-MongoDB component when using SSL connections by default. This option allows invalid host names during SSL, which can potentially open your connection up to man-in-the-middle attacks if set to true. The default value is false, meaning that the connection will prevent such attacks. However, you can change it to true if you wish, but be aware of the security implications.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and requirement status of the option "mongodbUser" in the Apache Camel component named "debezium-mongodb", and can you explain its purpose within this context?'
      answer: |
       'The option "mongodbUser" in the Apache Camel component named "debezium-mongodb" has a default value of null, meaning it is not set by default. This option represents the database user for connecting to MongoDB if required. It can be specified when configuring this component and will be used to authenticate with MongoDB during data transactions. The requirement status of "mongodbUser" is optional, indicating that providing it is not necessary for the functioning of the debezium-mongodb component.'
    - question: '"What is the purpose and default value of the ''notificationEnabledChannels'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-mongodb'', and is it required for use?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''notificationEnabledChannels'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-mongodb'' serves as a list of notification channels names that are enabled. It is optional, meaning you can choose to provide a value or not. If no value is provided, it defaults to null. This option pertains to the MongoDB group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "notificationSinkTopicName" option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and is it required when ''sink'' is included among the enabled channels?'

    - question: 'How does the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component work, and when is it beneficial to use it rather than the default exception handling provided by Camel?'
      answer: |
       'The `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which means any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. This can be advantageous when you want a more customized error handling strategy for your MongoDB operations rather than the default exception handling provided by Camel, which logs exceptions at WARN or ERROR level and ignores them. However, it''s important to note that this feature is only possible if the third-party component (in this case, Debezium-MongoDB) allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. Some components may handle exceptions internally only, and therefore `bridgeErrorHandler` is not possible in those cases. In situations where this functionality isn''t supported yet, improvements are being made to the Camel component to hook into the third-party component to make this possible for future releases.'

       'The "snapshotMode" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component determines how a snapshot is run upon the connector''s startup. The default value for this option is ''initial''. When set to ''initial'', if the connector does not detect any offsets for the logical server name, it executes a snapshot that captures the current full state of the configured tables. After the snapshot completes, the connector starts streaming changes from the oplog. Alternatively, you can choose the ''never'' option, which prevents the connector from running a snapshot upon startup. Instead, upon first startup, the connector immediately begins reading from the beginning of the oplog without taking a snapshot.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotData" option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotData" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component allows you to configure whether data should be snapshotted or not, by setting ''snapshot.mode'' as configuration_based. Its default value is false, meaning that a snapshot will not be taken unless explicitly configured. This option is not required when using this component, as it provides flexibility for managing when a snapshot should be initiated in your data synchronization process with MongoDB.'
    - question: 'How does configuring the `snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnDataError` option for the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb" impact the snapshotting process when an error occurs during data transfer, considering its default value and whether it is required or not?'
      answer: |
       'Configuring the `snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnDataError` option for the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb" allows you to control snapshotting when an error occurs during data transfer. By setting ''snapshot.mode'' as configuration-based, if you specify this option as true, it will enable snapshotting in case of an error. However, since its default value is false and it''s not required, snapshotting won''t happen automatically when an error occurs if you don''t explicitly set it to true. Essentially, this option provides a way to decide whether or not to take a snapshot during data transfer errors, based on your specific needs within the MongoDB group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnSchemaError" option in the Apache Camel''s debezium-mongodb component, and is it required for configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnSchemaError" option within the Apache Camel''s debezium-mongodb component serves the purpose of allowing you to specify whether the schema should be snapshotted or not in case of an error, when ''snapshot.mode'' is set as configuration_based. By default, this setting is set to false, meaning that if there''s an error, the schema will not be snapshotted. It is not required for configuration, as indicated by the "required":false attribute.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotSchema" option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and is it a required configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotSchema" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component is designed to control whether the schema should be snapshotted or not when ''snapshot.mode'' is set as configuration_based. Its default value is false, meaning the schema will not be snapshotted by default. This setting is optional and falls under the MongoDB configuration group in Debezium-MongoDB component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedStartStream" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb", and is it required for configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedStartStream" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb" determines whether a stream should start or not after snapshot based on the configuration of ''snapshot.mode''. If set to true, the stream will begin after the snapshot has been taken; otherwise (its default value), it won''t. This setting is optional and falls under the MongoDB group of configurations.'
    - question: 'What should be the value or type of configuration when using the ''snapshotModeCustomName'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, if we want to customize the implementation for determining whether a snapshot should be taken upon app boot? And is it required?'
      answer: |
       'The value or type of configuration when using the ''snapshotModeCustomName'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, if you want to customize the implementation for determining whether a snapshot should be taken upon app boot, should be a string. This string specifies the name of the custom implementation provided in the ''name()'' method, which must implement the ''Snapshotter'' interface. It is not required to set this configuration, as the default value is null.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "sourceinfoStructMaker" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb", and is it required to be explicitly set when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "sourceinfoStructMaker" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb" is io.debezium.connector.mongodb.MongoDbSourceInfoStructMaker. It''s not required to be explicitly set when using this component as it has a default value.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the "streamingDelayMs" option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and is it a required configuration parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "streamingDelayMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component is 0 milliseconds (ms). Its data type is duration. This configuration parameter is not required, meaning you can choose to provide a different value if needed, but it will function just fine without one as well. The group associated with this configuration option is "mongodb".'
    - question: 'In the context of the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component, when setting up the configuration for a data source, how can I modify the behavior to ensure that Kafka receives both a delete event and a tombstone event for key-based deletions in MongoDB, rather than just a delete event? Is it possible to change the default value to true for the ''tombstonesOnDelete'' option?'
      answer: |
       'To ensure that your Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB setup emits both a delete event and a tombstone event for key-based deletions in MongoDB, you can modify the ''tombstonesOnDelete'' option to true within your configuration. The default value is currently false, but by setting it to true, you can change this behavior to emit tombstone events, allowing Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to the given key once the source record gets deleted.'
    - question: 'What is the default value of the "topicNamingStrategy" option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component and what type of string should be used for a custom implementation, if any?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "topicNamingStrategy" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component is "io.debezium.schema.SchemaTopicNamingStrategy". If you wish to implement a custom TopicNamingStrategy, it should be a string adhering to the required type of "string". However, note that using a custom implementation is optional.'
    - question: 'What should be the required format for the "topicPrefix" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb", given that it identifies a namespace for the database server/cluster, only accepts alphanumeric characters, hyphens, dots and underscores, and must be unique across all other connectors?'
      answer: |
       'The required format for the "topicPrefix" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb" should consist of only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, dots, and underscores. This value identifies a namespace for the database server/cluster, and it must be unique across all other connectors since it is used as a prefix for all Kafka topic names that receive events emitted by this connector.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "transactionMetadataFactory" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component, and is it required to be set when using this component? Also, could you explain what role does the transactionMetadataFactory play in the context of the Debezium-MongoDB component?'
      answer: |
       'The "transactionMetadataFactory" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component is a class designed to create transaction context and transaction struct/schemas. Its default value is io.debezium.pipeline.txmetadata.DefaultTransactionMetadataFactory, which is a built-in factory provided by Debezium. This option is not required to be set explicitly as it has a default value, but setting a custom implementation can allow for more specific control over the transaction metadata creation process. The role of transactionMetadataFactory in the Debezium-MongoDB component is to provide the necessary structures and context for transactions, facilitating consistent and efficient handling of database operations within a transactional scope.'
