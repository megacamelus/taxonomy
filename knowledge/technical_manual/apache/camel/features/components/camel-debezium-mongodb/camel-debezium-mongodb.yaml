    - question: 'What are the acceptable usage patterns and example values for the "additionalProperties" option within the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb", which is used to set Debezium component properties that cannot be set directly on Camel configurations? Furthermore, could you provide an explanation of a property like additionalProperties.transactional.id=12345 and additionalProperties.schema.registry.url=http://localhost:8811/avro in this context?'
      answer: |
       'The "additionalProperties" option within the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb" is used to set Debezium component properties that cannot be configured directly on Camel configurations. These additional properties are prefixed with "additionalProperties.".              For example, "additionalProperties.transactional.id=12345" is a property related to the transaction mechanism in the Debezium engine. The value "12345" is setting a specific transaction ID. This could be useful for managing transactions and ensuring their correct behavior within your Debezium-MongoDB integration.              On the other hand, "additionalProperties.schema.registry.url=http://localhost:8811/avro" is a property that sets the URL of Avro schema registry. This configuration informs the Debezium engine where to find and use the Avro schemas for your messages during data synchronization. In this case, it points to a local Avro schema registry running on port 8811.'
    - question: 'How does setting the "bridgeErrorHandler" option to true in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component affect the handling of exceptions, compared to its default value (false), and under what conditions is it possible to utilize this feature?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "bridgeErrorHandler" option to true in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component enables the bridging of the consumer to the routing Error Handler, meaning any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages will be treated as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler. This is only possible if the third-party component allows Camel to be notified when an exception was thrown; otherwise, the default exception handling (logging at WARN or ERROR level and ignoring) is used. This feature may improve in future releases as Camel components are improved to integrate with more third-party components for better exception handling.'
    - question: 'What are the possible configurations that can be set for the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and is it required to provide such configurations when using this component in a consumer pattern?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component allows you to pre-configure certain settings via an object configuration. However, providing these configurations when using this component in a consumer pattern is not mandatory as indicated by its "required: false". In essence, this means that there are available options to set configurations for this component, but you can still use it even if no specific configuration is provided. For more information about the supported configuration groups, please refer to the "consumer" group within your specific Apache Camel documentation.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "internalKeyConverter" option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component and what class should be used as its default value if no custom converter is specified?'
      answer: |
       'The "internalKeyConverter" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component serves the purpose of handling serialization and deserialization of key data for offsets in Kafka Connect. If no custom converter is specified, the default class used is `org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter`. This means that key data will be converted to JSON format when sent to Kafka, and back from JSON format when consumed from Kafka.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "internalValueConverter" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb", and what Converter class is used by default when this option is not specified? Also, are there any prerequisites or groups associated with this configuration option in terms of usage?'
      answer: |
       'The "internalValueConverter" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb" serves the purpose of specifying a Converter class to be used for converting value data into offsets. By default, when this option is not explicitly specified, org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter is used for serialization and deserialization tasks. This Converter class is responsible for working with JSON data. It''s worth noting that the usage of this configuration option is associated with the "consumer" group in terms of its relevance. While there is no explicit requirement to provide a value for this option, you can customize it if needed, to cater to different data types or conversion requirements in your use case.'
    - question: 'What are the valid options for the `offsetCommitPolicy` in Apache Camel''s debezium-mongodb component, and what is its purpose regarding the commit of offsets? Furthermore, is the usage of this option mandatory (required: false) and does it have a default value?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel''s Debezium-MongoDB component, the `offsetCommitPolicy` option allows you to specify a Java class for the commit policy of offsets. This class should implement the ''OffsetCommitPolicy'' interface, defining when offsets commit is triggered based on the number of events processed and time elapsed since the last commit. By default, it uses a periodic commit policy based on time intervals, but you can customize this behavior by providing a suitable Java class. The usage of `offsetCommitPolicy` is optional, as indicated by its "required: false" setting. There''s no default value provided for this option.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel option `offsetCommitTimeoutMs` within the Debezium MongoDB component, and what is its default value and data type? Additionally, is it required when configuring this component and in which groups (if applicable) can we find it?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel option `offsetCommitTimeoutMs` in the Debezium MongoDB component serves to control the maximum duration (in milliseconds) that records are allowed to be flushed and partition offset data committed to offset storage before a process is cancelled. If the operation takes longer than this time, it will be aborted and retried in a future attempt. The default value for this option is 5 seconds (5000 milliseconds). It''s important to note that using this option is not mandatory, as it has a default value. This configuration can be found within the consumer groups when configuring this component.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and description of the "offsetFlushIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-mongodb" component, and can it be configured during the setup process? Furthermore, what data type is expected for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetFlushIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-mongodb" component is a duration type configuration that describes the interval at which to try committing offsets. Its default value is 60000 milliseconds (1 minute). This option can be configured during the setup process, however it''s optional as it has a default setting in place. The expected data type for this option is "duration".'
    - question: 'What is the default Java class used for storing Debezium MongoDB connector offsets in an Apache Camel route when the option for offsetStorage is not specified explicitly, and which group does this option belong to within the debezium-mongodb component configuration?'
      answer: |
       'In an Apache Camel route using the Debezium MongoDB component, if the option for offsetStorage is not explicitly specified, the default Java class used for storing connector offsets will be org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.FileOffsetBackingStore. This class is responsible for persisting the connector''s offsets in a file-based system. The option "offsetStorage" falls under the "consumer" group within the debezium-mongodb component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "offsetStorageFileName" option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, what is its default value, and under what circumstances is it required?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageFileName" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component serves as the path to store the offsets, which are crucial for keeping track of where a Kafka consumer has last read. This option becomes mandatory when you set `offset.storage` to the `FileOffsetBackingStore`. By default, it has no specified value (null). You will require this option when you wish to persist offsets on disk using a file storage system instead of the in-memory mode or other types of storage systems provided by Kafka itself. This configuration falls under the category of consumer settings for managing and processing data streams effectively within Camel.'
    - question: 'How many partitions should be used for the offset storage topic when using the Debezium MongoDB component with the KafkaOffsetBackingStore, and is it mandatory to specify this value? (Note: The default value can vary if specified.)'
      answer: |
       'When using the Debezium-MongoDB component alongside KafkaOffsetBackingStore, the number of partitions for the offset storage topic is optional and defaults to null. However, you can specify the number of partitions (an integer value) if you prefer. This setting dictates the partition structure when creating the offset storage topic.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the `offsetStorageReplicationFactor` option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and under what conditions is it required?'
      answer: |
       'The `offsetStorageReplicationFactor` option in the Apache Camel Debezium MongoDB component configures the replication factor used when creating the offset storage topic. This option is necessary when your offset.storage is set to the KafkaOffsetBackingStore. However, its default value is null, meaning if you don''t explicitly specify it, it won''t be set. Therefore, this parameter is only required under specific conditions where you intentionally use Kafka for offset storage and want to configure the replication factor for that storage. This falls under the "consumer" group of options within the component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "offsetStorageTopic" option within the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and is it a required parameter when the offset.storage is set to KafkaOffsetBackingStore?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageTopic" option within the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component serves the purpose of storing offsets in a specific Kafka topic. This is necessary when the `offset.storage` is set to KafkaOffsetBackingStore. However, it''s not a required parameter, as indicated by its group "consumer" and default value of null.'
    - question: 'Can you explain the purpose and default value of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb", and under what circumstances it may be necessary to set this option to false?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb" determines whether autowiring is enabled. This feature automatically configures components like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, among others, by looking up in the registry for a single instance of matching type. By default, this option is set to true.              However, setting it to false may be necessary if you prefer to manually configure your "debezium-mongodb" component, rather than having Camel perform the configuration automatically. For instance, you might want more control over how certain options or dependencies are configured for your specific use case.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and description of the ''captureMode'' option for the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and what other options are available for this setting in configuring it to capture changes from a MongoDB server?'
      answer: |
       'The ''captureMode'' option for the Apache Camel Debezium MongoDB component is set to ''change_streams_update_full'' by default. This setting determines how changes are captured from a MongoDB server. Using ''change_streams'' will capture changes via MongoDB Change Streams, but update events won''t contain full documents. Alternatively, selecting ''change_streams_update_full'' (the default) captures changes via MongoDB Change Streams and the update events will contain full documents. The ''captureMode'' option is of type string, optional, and belongs to the mongodb group when configuring it for capturing changes from a MongoDB server.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value, if any, of the `collectionExcludeList` option in the Apache Camel `debezium-mongodb` component when using this option to exclude specific MongoDB collection changes from monitoring? Additionally, is the use of this option optional or required, and where would you find it within the group options for this component?'
      answer: |
       'The `collectionExcludeList` option in the Apache Camel `debezium-mongodb` component is used to specify a comma-separated list of collection names that should be excluded from monitoring for changes. This can be either regular expressions or literal names. By default, no collections are excluded (i.e., `defaultValue` is null). The use of this option is optional as indicated by the `required: false`. You can find this option within the `groups` specifically under `mongodb`.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''collectionIncludeList'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The ''collectionIncludeList'' option within the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component allows you to specify a comma-separated list of collection names for which changes will be captured. This is an optional configuration as its default value is null, meaning that all collections are initially tracked if no value is provided. The purpose of this option is to limit or select specific collections based on desired criteria when working with your MongoDB database.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the ''converters'' option within the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and what are its default and allowed configuration values?'
      answer: |
       'The ''converters'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component allows you to use custom converters instead of the default ones provided. These custom converters can be defined using the ''.type'' config option and configured using various options that follow a ''.'' notation. For instance, if you define ''myCustomConverter.type'' as the converter type, you might configure it with options like ''myCustomConverter.someOption''. The default value for this option is null, meaning no custom converters are initially set. This feature can be found within the MongoDB group of configuration settings and its usage aims to facilitate mapping data between different schemas or formats as needed during database change data capture (CDC) processes.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the ''cursorMaxAwaitTimeMs'' option in the Apache Camel ''debezium-mongodb'' component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The ''cursorMaxAwaitTimeMs'' option in the Apache Camel ''debezium-mongodb'' component is an optional duration type configuration that specifies the maximum processing time in milliseconds to wait for the oplog cursor to process a single poll request from MongoDB. The default value for this option is null, which means there is no specified limit and it will wait indefinitely if necessary.'
    - question: 'What are the possible customizations for the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component''s MBean object name using the "customMetricTags" option, and how should a valid set of tags be formatted? (Example: k1=v1,k2=v2)'
      answer: |
       'The customization for the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component''s MBean object name can be achieved using the "customMetricTags" option. This allows you to provide key-value pairs that will customize the MBean object name. Each key represents a tag for the MBean object name, and the corresponding value is the value of that tag. For instance, you might set tags like k1=v1,k2=v2. Please note that the use of this option is optional, and by default it has no value.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "databaseExcludeList" option in the Apache Camel component named "debezium-mongodb"? Additionally, could you explain if this option is mandatory and under which group it falls?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseExcludeList" option in the "debezium-mongodb" component of Apache Camel serves a purpose to exclude certain databases from tracking changes. This option accepts a comma-separated list of regular expressions or literals that match the database names you want to ignore. By default, there is no predefined value for this option, as new or existing databases will be tracked unless specifically excluded. It is not a required option, so its usage can be optional depending on your needs. This particular option falls under the "mongodb" group since it relates specifically to MongoDB configurations in the Apache Camel routing framework.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, required status, and applicable groups of the option "databaseIncludeList" within the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb"?'
      answer: |
       'The option "databaseIncludeList" within the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb" serves to specify a comma-separated list of regular expressions or literals that identify the databases for which changes will be captured. This means you can limit data capture to specific databases according to specified patterns. The default value is null, implying no databases are included unless explicitly defined. The data type for this option is string. It is not a required parameter, meaning it may be omitted if all database changes are desired to be captured. This option applies only to the MongoDB group of components in Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and allowed range for the optional configuration parameter "errorsMaxRetries" in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component when dealing with connection errors?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional configuration parameter "errorsMaxRetries" in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component, when dealing with connection errors, is -1. This means there is no limit on the number of retries. However, you can specify a positive integer to set the maximum number of retries. If you prefer to disable retries, you can set it to 0.'
    - question: 'What are the different methods for handling failures during processing of events in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and what is the default value if no option is provided? (Options include: ''fail'', ''warn'', or ''ignore'')'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component provides three methods for handling failures during event processing: ''fail'' (default), ''warn'', and ''ignore''. In the ''fail'' mode, an exception indicating the corrupted event and its position is raised, causing the connector to stop. In the ''warn'' mode, the problematic event and its position will be logged and the event will be skipped without affecting the connector''s operation. Lastly, in the ''ignore'' mode, the problematic event will simply be ignored and the connector will continue processing other events. The default value for this option is ''fail''.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "fieldExcludeList" option within the "debezium-mongodb" component in Apache Camel, and can it be configured if it''s not required?'
      answer: |
       'The "fieldExcludeList" option within the "debezium-mongodb" component in Apache Camel is an optional configuration that allows you to exclude specific fields from being included in the change event message values. It expects a comma-separated list of fully-qualified names for the fields to be excluded, and its default value is null. If "fieldExcludeList" is not required for your use case, it can still be left unconfigured or set to an empty string ("") to include all fields in the change event messages.'
    - question: 'How can I use the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb option "fieldRenames" to rename specific fields in change event message values from a MongoDB database, and what is its default value and data type?'
      answer: |
       'To utilize the "fieldRenames" option offered by Apache Camel''s Debezium-Mongodb component, you can rename specific fields in change event message values from a MongoDB database by providing a comma-separated list of fully-qualified replacements. The format for this list is: `databaseName.collectionName.fieldName.nestedFieldName:newNestedFieldName`. You can use wildcards () to match any characters in databaseName or collectionName if needed.       The colon character (:) acts as a delimiter and determines the mapping of field renames. This option is not mandatory and its default value is null. Lastly, it''s important to note that the type of this option is a string and can be configured under the group "mongodb".'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "heartbeatIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and can it be required or disabled?'
      answer: |
       'The "heartbeatIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium MongoDB component is a duration value (in milliseconds) that specifies an interval during which the connector sends heartbeat messages to a designated heartbeat topic. By default, this feature is disabled (with a default value of 0ms). It can be set and used to monitor the status of the connector, but it''s optional. You may enable it if needed, or choose to leave it disabled.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and datatype of the option "heartbeatTopicsPrefix" in Apache Camel''s debezium-mongodb component, and can it be set as optional when configuring this component? (Hint: The description states that it is a string with a default value of __debezium-heartbeat and that it''s not required)'
      answer: |
       'The option "heartbeatTopicsPrefix" in Apache Camel''s debezium-mongodb component is a string type with a default value of "__debezium-heartbeat". This option is used to name heartbeat topics, and it''s not mandatory when configuring this component as indicated by the ''required: false''.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `incrementalSnapshotWatermarkingStrategy` option in Apache Camel''s `debezium-mongodb` component to `''insert_delete''` impact the signal data collection, compared to using its default value `INSERT_INSERT`?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `incrementalSnapshotWatermarkingStrategy` option in Apache Camel''s `debezium-mongodb` component to `''insert_delete''` results in writing only an open signal on the signal data collection, with the close being marked by deletion of the corresponding open signal. This contrasts with the default value `INSERT_INSERT`, where both open and close signals are written into the signal data collection.'
    - question: 'What is the default maximum size of a batch of records that can be set for the debezium-mongodb component in Apache Camel, and what is the data type of this option? If this value is not required and can be overridden, is there a way to do so, and if so, what are the possible range limits for the value when customizing it?'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel, for the debezium-mongodb component specifically, the default maximum size of a batch of source records is 2048. This option, referred to as "maxBatchSize", is of integer data type. If you''d like to override this value, it can be done as it''s an optional setting. When customizing the maxBatchSize, the acceptable range lies within your configuration, but keep in mind that values should be greater than or equal to 1.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and recommended usage of the "maxQueueSize" option in the Apache Camel component named "debezium-mongodb"? Also, explain when it''s necessary to ensure this value exceeds a certain threshold.'
      answer: |
       'The "maxQueueSize" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb" has a default value of 8192. This setting controls the maximum size of the queue for change events read from the MongoDB database log but not yet recorded or forwarded. It is recommended that this value always be larger than the maximum batch size to ensure smooth operation. This threshold needs to be ensured primarily because a larger maxQueueSize allows more events to buffer before being processed, which can improve performance and prevent bottlenecks when dealing with high volumes of change events. However, it''s essential to maintain a balance between buffering capacity and available system resources to avoid excessive memory consumption and potential service delays.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the option "maxQueueSizeInBytes" for the Apache Camel Debezium MongoDB component, and can this option be considered as required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the option "maxQueueSizeInBytes" in the Apache Camel Debezium MongoDB component is 0, which means this feature is not enabled by default. It has an integer data type, allowing it to accept whole numbers. However, using this option is not a requirement when working with the Debezium-MongoDB component as indicated by its "required" property being set to false.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and optional default value of the "mongodbAuthSource" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb", and when should this configuration be provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "mongodbAuthSource" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb" is designed for providing database credentials. Specifically, it refers to a database that contains user authentication information. Its default value is "admin", but this can be overridden if needed. This configuration is optional and should only be provided when connecting to a MongoDB server requiring authentication. It ensures secure communication by validating user credentials against the specified database.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "mongodbConnectionString" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "mongodbConnectionString" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component serves as the database connection string for establishing a connection to MongoDB. By default, this value is not set, meaning it requires manual configuration. Its usage is optional within the "mongodb" groups of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible range (with units) for the "mongodbConnectTimeoutMs" option in the Apache Camel component called "debezium-mongodb"? Additionally, is it a mandatory option and can it be grouped with any specific options?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "mongodbConnectTimeoutMs" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb" is 10 seconds (or 10,000 milliseconds), as it is a duration type. Although it''s not mandatory (set to false in the groups), it can be found under the "mongodb" group along with other related options.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible range (including whether it can be set to custom values) for the Debezium MongoDB component option ''mongodbHeartbeatFrequencyMs'', which specifies the interval at which the cluster monitor attempts to reach each server in seconds?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the ''mongodbHeartbeatFrequencyMs'' option in the Debezium MongoDB component is 10,000 milliseconds (equivalent to 10 seconds). It can be set to custom values as it has a type of ''duration'', and while it is not required, it is part of the ''mongodb'' group if you need to refer to it in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the mandatory string type field "mongodbPassword" in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb", which represents a password for connecting to MongoDB, when and if required?'
      answer: |
       'The "mongodbPassword" field, which is of string type and mandatory within the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb", serves as the password for establishing a connection to MongoDB when necessary. This means that, during the configuration of this particular component, you will need to provide this password if your setup requires it in order to successfully connect and interact with your MongoDB database.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the optional parameter ''mongodbPollIntervalMs'' in Apache Camel''s debezium-mongodb component, and what is its purpose?'
      answer: |
       'The optional parameter ''mongodbPollIntervalMs'' in Apache Camel''s debezium-mongodb component defaults to a duration of 30 seconds (30,000 ms). Its data type is duration. This parameter defines the interval for looking for new, removed, or changed replica sets, within your MongoDB environment, and can be adjusted as needed. It belongs to the ''mongodb'' group in the configuration options.'
    - question: 'What is the default duration and possible range of values for the "mongodbServerSelectionTimeoutMs" option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, if it is not required to be set? And what data type does this option use?'
      answer: |
       'The default duration for the "mongodbServerSelectionTimeoutMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component is 10,000 ms (or 10 seconds), as it defaults to this value if not specified explicitly. However, it can be adjusted as per requirement and accepts a range of durations, with a possible maximum set for this option being 30 seconds as indicated in the provided information. The data type for this option is "duration".'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the option "mongodbSocketTimeoutMs" when using the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb", and can it be considered as a required configuration? Also, what unit (e.g., milliseconds, seconds) is used for this option''s duration value?'
      answer: |
       'The option "mongodbSocketTimeoutMs" when using the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb" defaults to 0 milliseconds (ms). It is of data type "duration", indicating it accepts time values in units of seconds, minutes, or milliseconds. This option is not required as it can be configured but not mandatory for usage. The unit used for this duration value is milliseconds (ms).'
    - question: 'Given the provided information, here''s a question:              "What is the default value for the ''mongodbSslEnabled'' option in Apache Camel''s debezium-mongodb component, and is it required to specify this option when using this component?"'
      answer: |
       'The provided information states that the default value for the ''mongodbSslEnabled'' option in Apache Camel''s debezium-mongodb component is false, which means SSL is not enabled by default when connecting to MongoDB instances. Additionally, specifying this option is not a requirement when using the debezium-mongodb component.'
    - question: 'Here''s a possible question that can be answered based on the provided information:              "What is the default value for the ''mongodbSslInvalidHostnameAllowed'' option in the Apache Camel ''debezium-mongodb'' component, and what is its purpose in relation to SSL security?"'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the ''mongodbSslInvalidHostnameAllowed'' option in the Apache Camel ''debezium-mongodb'' component is false. This option controls whether invalid hostnames are allowed when using SSL. If set to true, the connection will not prevent man-in-the-middle attacks since it bypasses the validation of the server certificate against the hostname presented. Therefore, it poses a security risk and should be used with caution or explicitly configured to true only when necessary.'
    - question: 'What is the optional string parameter `mongodbUser` in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component used for and does it have a default value or is its use required?'
      answer: |
       'The `mongodbUser` is an optional string parameter within the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component. Its purpose is to specify the database user for connecting to MongoDB when necessary, although if it''s not provided, a default value will not be assigned. It belongs to the "mongodb" group of options in the component configuration.'
    - question: 'How does one set or configure the list of enabled notification channels using the `notificationEnabledChannels` option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component? If this option is not required, what would be an example of its use if it were required?'
      answer: |
       'To set or configure the list of enabled notification channels using the `notificationEnabledChannels` option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component, you can provide a comma-separated list of channel names. For example:              ```java       debezium-mongodbComponent().with(notificationEnabledChannels("emailChannel, slackChannel"));       ```              This will enable both ''emailChannel'' and ''slackChannel'' as notification channels. If this option is not required, it can be left null or omitted from the configuration entirely.              As for an example of its use if it were required, suppose you have three different notification channels - Email, SMS, and Slack. To enable only the Email channel when using the Debezium-MongoDB component, you would set:              ```java       debezium-mongodbComponent().with(notificationEnabledChannels("Email"));       ```              In this example, SMS and Slack channels are not enabled because they''re not included in the notificationEnabledChannels list.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "notificationSinkTopicName" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb", and is it mandatory for usage? (Hint: This option is used to set the name of the topic for notifications, but its use depends on whether ''sink'' is enabled.)'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb," the "notificationSinkTopicName" option sets the name of the topic for the notifications. This option is only necessary when the ''sink'' channel is enabled in your configuration, as it is one of the channels supported by the Debezium MongoDB connector for publishing change events. The default value for this option is null, meaning you have to provide a custom string value if you choose to use it. However, it is not a mandatory parameter for using the debezium-mongodb component.'

    - question: 'In the context of the Apache Camel''s debezium-mongodb component, when setting up a connection, if the option ''tombstonesOnDelete'' is set to true, what kind of behavior will it exhibit regarding delete operations in comparison to when it is set to false?'
      answer: |
       'When you set the ''tombstonesOnDelete'' option for the Apache Camel''s Debezium-MongoDB component to true, it will exhibit a behavior where delete operations are represented by both a delete event and a subsequent tombstone event. This allows Kafka to completely remove all events associated with a given key once the source record is deleted in MongoDB. On the other hand, if ''tombstonesOnDelete'' is set to false, it will only generate a delete event without emitting any tombstone event, meaning that the old data may persist in Kafka for the specified retention time.'
    - question: 'What is the default value of the `topicNamingStrategy` option in the Apache Camel Debezium MongoDB component and what kind of string class should it be when a custom TopicNamingStrategy is specified?

      answer: |
       'The `topicPrefix` option in Apache Camel''s debezium-mongodb component should be a string format consisting of only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, dots, and underscores. This prefix is used to identify and provide a unique namespace for the Kafka topics receiving events emitted by this connector. Since multiple connectors may run concurrently, it is crucial that the topic prefix is unique across all connectors.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "additionalProperties" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-mongodb" component, and what type of data should be provided if I wish to set properties that cannot be directly configured on the Camel configuration, but rather on the underlying Debezium engine such as Kafka Connect properties (for example setting Kafka OffsetBackingStore or Schema Registry URL)?'
      answer: |
       'The "additionalProperties" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-mongodb" component serves a specific purpose of accommodating additional properties required by Debezium components, which can''t be set directly on Camel configurations. These properties often include settings for Kafka Connect, such as Kafka OffsetBackingStore and Schema Registry URL. To provide values for such properties, they should be prefixed with "additionalProperties". For example, you can set the Kafka OffsetBackingStore and Schema Registry URL by providing:              1. `additionalProperties.transactional.id=12345` (for Kafka OffsetBackingStore)       2. `additionalProperties.schema.registry.url=http://localhost:8811/avro` (for Avro Schema Registry URL).

      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel Debezium MongoDB component, the "internalKeyConverter" option serves to define a Converter class responsible for serializing and deserializing key data used for offset management purposes. The default Converter is org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter, but it''s optional as you can provide a custom one if required. This option pertains to consumer configuration since it influences the manner in which the component consumes records from MongoDB, particularly how it handles the keys associated with those records.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "internalValueConverter" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb", and what class should be used as its default value if it''s not explicitly set? Furthermore, can we specify this option as mandatory in our configuration?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb," the "internalValueConverter" option is utilized for serially and deserializing value data related to offsets during the data transfer process. By default, it uses an instance of org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter, which means the data will be converted in JSON format. You can set a different Converter class if you wish to, but it''s optional; it may not be required explicitly in your configuration. If left unspecified, the default JSON converter will be used.'
    - question: 'What are the valid options for the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component''s offsetCommitPolicy option when defining a custom commit policy, and how can I implement such a class if I want to trigger offset commits based on both the number of events processed and the time elapsed since the last commit?'
      answer: |
       'To define a custom commit policy for Apache Camel''s debezium-mongodb component''s offsetCommitPolicy option, the valid choice would be implementing the ''OffsetCommitPolicy'' interface in Java. This class should trigger offset commits based on both the number of events processed and the time elapsed since the last commit.              The default is a periodic commit policy based upon time intervals, but for a custom approach, you can create your own class that extends or implements OffsetCommitPolicy as per your requirements. In this class, implement methods like `shouldCommit()` to determine when to trigger commits and adhere to the interface''s contract. For example:              ```java       public class CustomOffsetCommitPolicy implements OffsetCommitPolicy {           // Define necessary variables and logic for number of events processed and time elapsed since last commit                  @Override           public void configure(Context context) {               // Initialize variables and optional settings here           }                  @Override           public boolean shouldCommit() {               // Determine if a commit should be triggered based on both number of events processed and time elapsed                      return true/false; // Return true if commit should be triggered, false otherwise           }       }       ```'

It''s important to note that the default value for this option is null. This means it doesn''t have a preset value when using the component, and it can be set according to your specific use case if necessary. The "snapshotFetchSize" option falls under the MongoDB group of options and isn''t required to be specified when utilizing the debezium-mongodb component. However, adjusting this setting can help optimize your snapshot operation as per your memory constraints and data handling requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the option ''snapshotIncludeCollectionList'' in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The ''snapshotIncludeCollectionList'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component specifies a list of collections whose snapshot must be taken when creating or restarting the connector. This setting is not mandatory, as it has a default value of null, meaning that all collections are included by default if this option is left unspecified. If you wish to include only specific collections in the snapshot process, you should provide their list explicitly for this option. This feature falls under the MongoDB group of settings within this component.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and maximum allowable configuration for the ''snapshotMaxThreads'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component, and can this option be marked as required during its usage?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the ''snapshotMaxThreads'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component is 1, meaning only one thread will be used to perform the snapshot. However, you can configure a maximum number of threads according to your needs. This option is not marked as required by default, so you can choose whether or not to set a value for it during usage.'
    - question: 'What are the two options available for the `snapshotMode` of the Apache Camel component ''debezium-mongodb'' and what does each option do with regards to taking a snapshot upon startup of the connector? Furthermore, which option is set as the default value if no value is specified during configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The `debezium-mongodb` component within Apache Camel provides two options for the `snapshotMode` setting: ''initial'' (default) and ''never''. The ''initial'' option causes the connector to take a snapshot of the configured MongoDB tables upon startup if it does not detect any existing offsets for the specified logical server name. This snapshot captures the current full state of the tables. After completing the snapshot, the connector begins reading changes from the oplog. On the other hand, the ''never'' option prevents a snapshot from being taken during connector startup; instead, it immediately starts reading data from the beginning of the oplog upon first startup. By default, the ''initial'' snapshot mode is used when no value for `snapshotMode` is specified during configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotData'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component when its ''snapshot.mode'' configuration is set to configuration_based, and what is its default value and type?'
      answer: |
       'The ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotData'' option within the Apache Camel Debezium MongoDB component is designed to allow you to control whether data should be snapshotted when the ''snapshot.mode'' configuration is set to ''configuration_based''. By default, this option has a false value, meaning that data snapshots will not be taken unless explicitly configured to do so. It''s a boolean type and, while it is not required, it belongs to the MongoDB component groups.'
    - question: '"What is the default value and purpose of the ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnDataError'' option within the Apache Camel component ''debezium-mongodb'', and can this setting be set as required or omitted when using this component?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnDataError'' option within the Apache Camel component ''debezium-mongodb'' is a boolean configuration that determines whether data should be snapped during an error scenario when ''snapshot.mode'' is set to configuration-based. By default, this setting is disabled (false). It can be omitted as it has a false value by default and is not marked as required in its group (''mongodb'').'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and possible values for the "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnSchemaError" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component when configuring the snapshot mode as configuration-based, and is it necessary to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnSchemaError" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-MongoDB component, when configured with snapshot mode set as ''configuration_based'', is that it does not permit schema snapshotting in case of error. This setting accepts boolean values (true or false). However, providing a value for this option is optional as its default value is false.'
    - question: 'In the context of using the Apache Camel''s Debezium MongoDB component, could you explain when and why it would be beneficial to set the "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotSchema" option to true while working with the ''debezium-mongodb'' component? And, what is its default value if this configuration is not specified?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using Apache Camel''s Debezium MongoDB component, setting the "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotSchema" option to true would allow you to explicitly choose when the schema should be snapshot during an operation. This can be beneficial when you need to control the schema capture in your specific use case, such as if you have a complex or evolving schema that requires precise timing for data consistency. If this configuration is not specified, its default value is false, meaning the schema will not be snapshotted automatically.'
    - question: 'How is the behavior of a debezium-mongodb stream determined when using the ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedStartStream'' option in Apache Camel, and what happens if it''s set as false or not provided (since its default value is false)?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using Apache Camel with Debezium for MongoDB integration, the ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedStartStream'' option determines the behavior of the stream regarding the starting point when the snapshot mode is set to configuration-based (i.e., ''snapshot.mode'' is ''configuration_based''). If this setting is set to false or not provided (since its default value is false), it indicates that the stream will start at the latest available position in the change stream, and no explicit snapshot will be taken before the stream starts. In other words, the stream continues from where it was left off during the last execution, rather than starting a fresh snapshot based on the provided configuration.'
    - question: 'How should the `snapshotModeCustomName` option be configured in an Apache Camel route that uses the Debezium MongoDB component, if you want to specify a custom snapshot implementation for determining whether to do a snapshot during app boot? And what should the specified value represent in this case?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the `snapshotModeCustomName` option in an Apache Camel route using the Debezium MongoDB component, you should set its value to the specific name of your custom implementation that implements the ''Snapshotter'' interface. This name must be returned from the ''name()'' method within the custom implementation. If ''snapshot.mode'' is set as custom and ''snapshotModeCustomName'' is specified, the component will call this custom implementation during app boot to determine whether to do a snapshot.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the optional "sourceinfoStructMaker" option in the Apache Camel debezium-mongodb component, and what is its purpose in defining the SourceInfo schema and struct?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional "sourceinfoStructMaker" in the Apache Camel Debezium MongoDB component is io.debezium.connector.mongodb.MongoDbSourceInfoStructMaker. This class is responsible for returning the SourceInfo schema and struct, essentially defining the structure of data that will be replicated from a MongoDB database to another system using Apache Camel Debezium connector.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb" option called "tombstonesOnDelete", and when is it typically set to true?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb" option titled "tombstonesOnDelete" is false. This option determines whether delete operations should be represented by a single delete event or a delete event followed by a tombstone event. When set to true, the component will emit an additional tombstone event after deleting a record, allowing Kafka to fully erase all related events tied to the given key from the source database. However, setting it to true is optional and its typical use depends on the specific data retention requirements of your application.'
    - question: 'What is the default TopicNamingStrategy class used by the debezium-mongodb component in Apache Camel for determining the topic name for data, schema, transaction, heartbeat events, if a custom naming strategy is not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The default TopicNamingStrategy class used by the debezium-mongodb component in Apache Camel, when no custom naming strategy is specified, is "io.debezium.schema.SchemaTopicNamingStrategy".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, allowed character set, default value, type, and whether it''s required for the option named "topicPrefix" in the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb", and what are the acceptable characters for this option apart from alphanumeric?'
      answer: |
       'The "topicPrefix" option within the Apache Camel component "debezium-mongodb" serves as a unique namespace for the particular database server/cluster that this connector is capturing changes from. This prefix is essential since it is prepended to all Kafka topic names receiving events emitted by this connector.              The allowed character set for this option includes alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-), dots (.), and underscores (_). It does not have a default value and must be provided as it is required. This setting belongs to the "mongodb" group.'
