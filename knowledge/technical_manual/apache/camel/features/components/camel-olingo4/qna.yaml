    - question: 'What is the method to use a shared configuration in Apache Camel''s Olingo4 component, and is it required? Also, what type of value does this option accept, and where can we find more information about the ''common'' groups in this context?'
      answer: |
       'To utilize a shared configuration with Apache Camel''s Olingo4 component, you should set the option to "configuration" and pass an object that contains your desired settings. It is not mandatory to use this option, as it has a default value of null, meaning no specific configuration will be applied if not provided.              Regarding the ''common'' groups in this context, they refer to a predefined category or collection of options within the Olingo4 component that may be used together. For detailed information about these groups and other aspects of using Olingo4 with Apache Camel, you can refer to the respective documentation provided by the Apache Camel project.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and range for the Apache Camel olingo4 component option named "connectTimeout", and can it be set as a required configuration? Based on the provided information, the default value of the "connectTimeout" option in the Apache Camel olingo4 component is 30,000 milliseconds (30 seconds), and its range is any positive integer. The configuration of this option is not marked as required, meaning it can be omitted if a different value is not needed.'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "connectTimeout" option in the Apache Camel olingo4 component is 30,000 milliseconds (30 seconds), and its range is any positive integer. It can be set as a configuration option but is not marked as required, meaning it can be omitted if a different value is not needed.'
    - question: 'What is the default Content-Type header value for messages in Apache Camel''s olingo4 component when using JSON or XML message format, and is it required to specify this value explicitly?'
      answer: |
       'The default Content-Type header value for messages in Apache Camel''s olingo4 component is `application/json;charset=utf-8`, however, specifying this value explicitly is not required as it defaults to JSON format. If you wish to use XML, you can adjust the Content-Type accordingly.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "filterAlreadySeen" option in the Apache Camel olingo4 component, and can it be considered as a mandatory configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "filterAlreadySeen" option in the Apache Camel olingo4 component is designed to filter out results that have already been communicated by this component. Its default value is false, meaning it''s not set to filter out any previously communicated results by default. This option can be considered as an optional configuration since it''s not required for the component to function.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "httpHeaders" option in the Apache Camel component "olingo4", and is it required or optional? Also, where can this option be found in terms of its group name?'
      answer: |
       'The "httpHeaders" option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component allows you to customize HTTP headers that will get injected into every request. This could include OAuth tokens or any other headers you might need, such as custom authentication tokens. By default, it has no value ("defaultValue": null). Whether this option is used or not depends on your specific requirements as it''s optional ("required": false). You can find this option under the "common" group of settings in the component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the ''proxy'' option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component, and is it required when configuring this component? Also, could you briefly explain what the ''proxy'' option does?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the ''proxy'' option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component is null, meaning no default proxy server configuration is set. The ''proxy'' option allows you to configure an HTTP proxy server when using this component. When setting up this component, providing a proxy configuration is optional but can be useful if your system needs to send requests through a proxy server.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "serviceUri" option in the Apache Camel olingo4 component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceUri" option in the Apache Camel olingo4 component is an optional setting for specifying the base URI of the OData service you wish to interact with. The default value for this option is null, meaning that no service base URI is set by default. It belongs to the common group of options, suggesting it is a general configuration option for using this component with OData services.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the optional Apache Camel component olingo4 configuration option named "socketTimeout", and how can it be specified when using this option in a Camel route?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional Apache Camel component olingo4 configuration option named "socketTimeout" is an integer value of 30,000 (30 seconds). This setting determines the HTTP request timeout in milliseconds. If you wish to specify a different value when using this option in a Camel route, you can do so by providing an integer as follows: socketTimeout(YOUR_TIMEOUT_VALUE_IN_MILLISECONDS).'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel component olingo4''s bridgeErrorHandler option and when should it be set to true? Also, can you explain the default behavior when this option is not set or false?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel component "olingo4" enables bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages will be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.              This feature is only applicable if the third-party component allows Camel to be notified when an exception was thrown. Some components handle exceptions internally, in which case the "bridgeErrorHandler" is not possible. However, in situations where we can hook into the third-party component, this functionality may be improved for future releases.              By default, when the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is not set or false, the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions. These exceptions will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and then ignored. Setting the "bridgeErrorHandler" to true allows for more customized error handling of exceptions within the Camel routing system.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the "splitResult" option in the Apache Camel olingo4 component when consuming data from an endpoint that returns an array or collection, and under what circumstances can this behavior be overridden?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "splitResult" option in the Apache Camel olingo4 component is to map each element of an array or collection returned by an endpoint as individual messages. However, you can override this default behavior by setting the "splitResult" option to false. This can be done when you want a single message instead of multiple messages from an endpoint that returns an array or collection.'
    - question: 'How does the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component affect the behavior of the producer, and why might it be useful to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component allows you to defer the start of a producer until the first message is processed. This can be beneficial when a producer may otherwise fail during the CamelContext or route startup, causing the entire route to fail.              By setting this option to true, you enable error handling within the routing system using Camel''s routing error handlers. However, be aware that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some additional time, thereby extending the total processing time for that message. This approach can help ensure a more robust start-up process for your routes, especially in situations where a producer might cause issues during the initial startup phase.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component, and can this option be marked as required?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component is designed to control whether autowiring is enabled for automatic autowiring of options. Its default value is true, meaning that autowiring is enabled by default. This option allows finding a single instance of matching type in the registry and configuring it on the component automatically, which can be useful for configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, etc. The "autowiredEnabled" option can be marked as required if needed, but its use is optional within the advanced configuration groups.'
    - question: 'How can you customize the connection timeout, socket timeout, proxy settings, and SSL context for HTTP requests in Apache Camel''s olingo4 component using the httpAsyncClientBuilder option, and what is the default value of this option?'
      answer: |
       'To customize the connection timeout, socket timeout, proxy settings, and SSL context for HTTP requests in Apache Camel''s olingo4 component, you can utilize the `httpAsyncClientBuilder` option. This allows for more complex HTTP client configuration. By overriding this builder, you can set specific values for connectionTimeout, socketTimeout, proxy, and sslContext. It is crucial to specify a socketTimeout in the builder; otherwise, OData requests could potentially block indefinitely. Please note that providing a value for this option is optional, with no default value assigned by default. This configuration group falls under the ''advanced'' settings category in Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the custom HTTP client builder for the Apache Camel Olingo4 component to set specific values for connectionTimeout, socketTimeout, proxy, and sslContext? Does the configuration require providing a socketTimeout value in the builder, and if so, why is this necessary?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the custom HTTP client builder for the Apache Camel Olingo4 component, you can set specific values for connectionTimeout, socketTimeout, proxy, and sslContext. This is done within the "option" field designated as "httpClientBuilder."              Since the OData requests could block indefinitely if a socketTimeout isn''t specified in the builder, it is essential to provide a socketTimeout value in your configuration. The necessity of this setting arises from the potential for network issues that might cause delays, ensuring your application doesn''t get stuck waiting for a response.              Remember that while providing these configurations is optional (as indicated by "required": false), they can be particularly useful when dealing with more complex HTTP client configuration scenarios. These settings are categorized under the advanced group of options in the configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `sslContextParameters` option in the Apache Camel olingo4 component, and can it be configured without a default value? Is its use related to enhancing security features within this component?'
      answer: |
       'The `sslContextParameters` option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component is designed for configuring security using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) context parameters. Although it doesn''t have a default value, you can choose to configure it if needed within your setup. Its purpose is indeed related to enhancing the security features within this component by enabling secure connections between the consumer and producer of messages using SSL/TLS protocols.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "useGlobalSslContextParameters" option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component impact the SSL context configuration, and what is its default value when this option is not explicitly set?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "useGlobalSslContextParameters" option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component allows for the global SSL context parameters to be utilized during SSL connections. This means that instead of setting SSL context properties separately for each connection, you can configure them once globally. When this option is not explicitly set, its default value is false, meaning that individual SSL context parameters will be used for each connection rather than relying on the global ones.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and maximum allowable range for the Apache Camel olingo4 component''s connectTimeout option in milliseconds? Also, is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel olingo4 component''s connectTimeout option is 30,000 milliseconds (30 seconds). The maximum allowable range isn''t specified in the information provided, but it typically allows values as an integer. It is not mandatory to provide a value for this option as it has a default value set.'
    - question: 'What is the default Content-Type header value when using the olingo4 component in Apache Camel for JSON or XML message format, and can it be explicitly set to another value if needed?'
      answer: |
       'The default Content-Type header value when working with the olingo4 component in Apache Camel is `application/json;charset=utf-8`. However, you have the option to explicitly set this value to JSON or XML format, depending on your requirements, as it can be used to specify the message format.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "filterAlreadySeen" option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component, and can it be considered as a mandatory configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "filterAlreadySeen" option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component is designed to filter out results that have already been communicated by this component. Its default value is false, meaning this filtering is not automatically enabled. While it''s not mandatory to set this option, if you wish to exclude previously communicated results from further processing, you can configure it to true.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "httpHeaders" option in the Apache Camel olingo4 component and can it be left empty or does it require a specific value, as well as what type of data it expects and whether its usage is optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "httpHeaders" option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component serves to inject custom HTTP headers into every request. This can include tokens such as OAuth for authentication purposes. The default value for this option is null, meaning it doesn''t have a predefined value when the component is initialized. It expects data in an object format, which can contain multiple key-value pairs representing different HTTP headers. Its usage is optional; you can choose to not provide any value if you don''t need to inject custom headers into your requests.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "inBody" option in the Apache Camel component olingo4, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "inBody" option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component allows you to set the name of a parameter to be passed in the exchange In Body. Its default value is null, meaning no predefined value is assigned if not explicitly provided. It''s worth noting that providing a value for this option is optional, as indicated by the "required" field being set to false.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the HTTP proxy server for the Apache Camel Olingo4 component when using it in a Camel route?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the HTTP proxy server for the Apache Camel Olingo4 component within a Camel route, you would need to create an object with "proxy" as the option and set its properties accordingly. Here''s an example of how to do this:              ```java       Properties proxyProperties = new Properties();       proxyProperties.put("host", "<your_proxy_host>");       proxyProperties.put("port", "<your_proxy_port>");       proxyProperties.put("username", "<your_proxy_username>");       proxyProperties.put("password", "<your_proxy_password>");              Olingo4Component olingo = new Olingo4Component();       olingo.setProperty(Exchange.HTTP_PROXY_PROPERTY, proxyProperties);       ```              Then, include this component in your Camel route:              ```java       from("direct:start")           .to("olingo4://<your_service>?" +               "proxy=" + olingo.getClass().getName() + ''&'' +               Exchange.HTTP_PROXY_PROPERTY + "=#proxyProperties");       ```'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "serviceUri" option in the Apache Camel component "olingo4"? And, is it a required parameter? If not, does it have a default value if not provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceUri" option in the Apache Camel component "olingo4" serves as the Target OData service base URI, such as http://services.odata.org/OData/OData.svc. It is an optional parameter, meaning it can be provided during configuration but its absence will not prevent the component from initializing. If you do not provide a "serviceUri", there is no default value assigned to it.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the socketTimeout option for the Apache Camel component olingo4, and can this option be marked as required?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `socketTimeout` option in the Apache Camel `olingo4` component is an integer of 30,000 milliseconds (equivalent to 30 seconds). This option represents the HTTP request timeout in milliseconds, which can be adjusted if necessary. Regarding your second question, it is worth noting that this option can be set as optional, since its default value is provided and its usage isn''t compulsory.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle'' option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component, and can it be configured as a required or optional setting? (Answer: The purpose of the ''sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle'' option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component is to allow you to send an empty message if the polling consumer did not poll any files. Its default value is false, and it can be configured as an optional setting.)'
      answer: |
       'The ''sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle'' option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component allows you to configure it to send an empty message (no body) if the polling consumer did not poll any files during idle periods. Its default value is false, meaning this feature is disabled by default. This setting can be configured as an optional one within the ''consumer'' group.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and required nature of the "splitResult" option in the Apache Camel olingo4 component when consuming data from an endpoint that returns an array or collection? Additionally, how can this behavior be overridden if needed?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "splitResult" option in the Apache Camel olingo4 component is to map each element of an array or collection returned by an endpoint to distinct messages. This behavior can be overridden if needed, as the option has a default value of true but is also optional and can be set to false in your configuration to prevent splitting the result into individual messages.'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel olingo4 component handle exceptions during message consumption, and can the bridgeErrorHandler option be used to route these exceptions as messages to the Camel routing Error Handler? Additionally, what is the default behavior when the bridgeErrorHandler option is not set (i.e., its value is false)?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel olingo4 component, by default, exceptions that occur during message consumption are handled internally using the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler`. These exceptions are logged at WARN or ERROR level and then ignored. However, if you want to route these exceptions as messages to the Camel routing Error Handler, you can make use of the "bridgeErrorHandler" option.              The bridgeErrorHandler allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, meaning any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. It''s important to note that this feature is only possible if the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. Some components manage exceptions internally, making bridgeErrorHandler usage impossible.              When the bridgeErrorHandler option is not set (i.e., its value is false), it follows the default behavior as described above.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom ExceptionHandler when using the Apache Camel olingo4 component in my Camel route, if I want to handle exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level and not ignored by default?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom ExceptionHandler when using the Apache Camel olingo4 component in your Camel route, you can set the "exceptionHandler" option in the OData producer configuration. Since your intention is to handle exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level and not ignored by default, you would provide an implementation of the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler interface as the value for this option. This custom ExceptionHandler will be responsible for handling and processing exceptions occurring in your Camel route. Keep in mind that if the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled, the "exceptionHandler" option may not be in use, so ensure you disable "bridgeErrorHandler" to make the most of your custom ExceptionHandler. The "exceptionHandler" configuration is part of the advanced consumer group, so you will find it when defining consumer settings for your OData producer component in your Camel route.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel olingo4 component, and is it required when using the consumer? Also, what is its default value and the group to which it belongs?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component is used to set the exchange pattern when a consumer creates an exchange. It''s not mandatory to use this option, as it has a default value of null. This option is considered advanced and belongs to the "consumer (advanced)" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, configurability, and group of the `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel component called olingo4, and under what advanced configuration settings does it fall?'
      answer: |
       'The `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel component called olingo4 is designed to offer customizable error handling during the poll operation before an Exchange is created and routed within Camel. It allows you to provide your own implementation of the `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy`. The default value for this option is null, meaning no specific strategy is set by default. This configuration option can be found under the "consumer (advanced)" group, indicating it is part of advanced Camel settings that may require more specialized knowledge to configure and use effectively.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel olingo4 component affect the starting behavior of its producer, and why might it be useful to defer the startup of a producer using this feature?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel olingo4 component allows for the delayed startup of its producer. This can be particularly useful when a producer may potentially fail during the initial starting phase, causing an entire route to fail. By deferring the startup to a lazy mode, the failure can instead be managed through Camel''s routing error handlers.              However, keep in mind that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time, thereby extending the total processing duration of the message handling. This approach can help avoid route failures due to problematic producers while allowing for more flexible control over the startup process.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel component olingo4''s option called `httpAsyncClientBuilder`, and what configuration options can be customized using this feature, including any default values or requirements for its use?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel component "olingo4" provides an advanced option named `httpAsyncClientBuilder`. This custom HTTP async client builder allows for more intricate configuration of the HTTP client, particularly in terms of connectionTimeout, socketTimeout, proxy, and sslContext. It''s crucial to specify a socketTimeout within the builder; otherwise, OData requests could potentially block indefinitely. By default, this option has no predefined value. This feature is categorized under the "advanced" group in the component''s configuration options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel component olingo4''s option named `httpClientBuilder`, and what configuration options does it provide for advanced HTTP client configuration in OData requests? Also, is specifying a socketTimeout mandatory when using this option, and why could requests block indefinitely if it is not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel component named `olingo4` offers an advanced configuration option called `httpClientBuilder`. This custom HTTP client builder allows for more intricate setup of HTTP client configurations, specifically overriding parameters like connectionTimeout, socketTimeout, proxy settings, and sslContext. It''s important to note that when using this option, a socketTimeout MUST be specified within the builder; otherwise, OData requests could potentially block indefinitely since the default timeout setting might not always be sufficient for certain scenarios or network conditions, leading to unforeseen delays or even infinite blocking of the requests.'
    - question: '"What is the purpose and default value of the ''backoffErrorThreshold'' option in the Apache Camel component named ''olingo4'', and under what group is this configuration setting typically found?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''backoffErrorThreshold'' option in the Apache Camel component named ''olingo4'' serves as the number of subsequent error polls that should occur before the ''backoffMultipler'' should activate, due to some failure during the polling process. This value is of type integer and has no default value; it can be set explicitly if required. The configuration setting is typically found under the ''scheduler'' group within the component''s configuration settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component, and in what group of configuration options can it be found (if applicable)?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component is a configurable setting that determines the number of consecutive idle polls before the backoffMultiplier kicks in. This means that if no response is received after a specified number of idle polls (defined by this option), the component will increase the delay between subsequent polls, using the "backoffMultiplier" to control the exponential backoff strategy. The default value for this option is null, which implies it does not have a predefined value and can be set at your discretion. This configuration option falls under the "scheduler" group in the overall settings of the Apache Camel Olingo4 component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "backoffMultiplier" option in the Apache Camel component "olingo4", and under what conditions should it be used along with the options "backoffIdleThreshold" or "backoffErrorThreshold"? Additionally, could you please explain what value type this option accepts and if there''s a default value assigned to it?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffMultiplier" option in the Apache Camel component "olingo4" is designed to allow the scheduled polling consumer to pause or skip attempts if there have been a specific number of subsequent idle periods or errors. This multiplier determines the number of polls that will be skipped before another attempt is made.              It should be used in combination with the options "backoffIdleThreshold" or "backoffErrorThreshold", as these configurations set the conditions under which the backoff mechanism will be triggered – either when there are consecutive idle periods (defined by "backoffIdleThreshold") or errors (defined by "backoffErrorThreshold").              The value type for the "backoffMultiplier" option is an integer. While it doesn''t have a default value assigned to it, this means that you can set any positive or zero integer as its value when configuring your polling consumer.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delay" option in the Apache Camel component named "olingo4", and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "delay" option in the Apache Camel component called "olingo4" serves as the milliseconds delay before the next poll for this specific component. Its default value is set at 500, which means if no custom delay value is provided, it will poll every 500 milliseconds (or half a second). However, it''s important to note that providing a value for this option is not mandatory; it can be left as optional within the context of using the "olingo4" component.'
    - question: 'What is the function of the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel olingo4 component when set to true, and how does it affect the behavior of the ScheduledPollConsumer?'
      answer: |
       'When you set the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component to true, it allows the ScheduledPollConsumer to initiate another run immediately if the previous run polled one or more messages. In other words, if new messages become available during a polling cycle, the consumer will not wait for the scheduled time interval to elapse but will process them right away. This can be beneficial in scenarios where you want to handle incoming messages as quickly as possible. However, keep in mind that this option is not required and its default value is false.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel component "olingo4", and is it required when using this component? (The answer can be found from the provided information.)'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel component "olingo4" is set to 1000 milliseconds. This delay before the first poll is not mandatory, as it has a false value under the "required" field in the provided information.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the "repeatCount" option in Apache Camel''s olingo4 component when it comes to the number of times a scheduled process will execute, and how can this behavior be customized?'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s olingo4 component, the default behavior of the "repeatCount" option is that it allows a scheduled process to fire indefinitely, as its default value is 0. However, you can customize this behavior by specifying a maximum limit for the number of times the process will execute. For instance, if you set "repeatCount" to 1, the scheduler will only fire once, and if you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. Keep in mind that a value of zero or negative means the process will continue firing forever.'
    - question: 'What is the default logging level for the "start/complete" logs generated by the Apache Camel Olingo4 consumer when it polls, and how can I configure this logging level if needed? Also, are there any specific groups where this configuration option belongs to in the Camel context?'
      answer: |
       'The default logging level for the "start/complete" logs generated by the Apache Camel Olingo4 consumer when it polls is TRACE. You can configure this logging level if needed using the "runLoggingLevel" option. This configuration belongs to the "scheduler" group in the Camel context.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom or shared thread pool using Apache Camel''s Olingo4 component, and what is the default behavior for this option if it is not specified?'
      answer: |
       'In response to your query, you can configure a custom or shared thread pool for Apache Camel''s Olingo4 component using the "scheduledExecutorService" option. By default, each consumer uses its own single-threaded thread pool. However, if you wish to utilize a custom/shared thread pool, you can do so by providing your configuration when setting up the component. If this option is not specified, it will continue to use the default behavior of using a separate single-threaded thread pool for each consumer.'
    - question: 'What is the default value of the "scheduler" option in the Apache Camel Olingo4 component and how can it be configured to use a cron scheduler from either the Camel-Spring or Camel-Quartz components?'
