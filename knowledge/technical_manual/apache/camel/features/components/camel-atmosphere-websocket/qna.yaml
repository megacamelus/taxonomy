    - question: 'Can you explain when and why it might be beneficial to configure the `bridgeErrorHandler` option as true for an Apache Camel component using the Atmosphere-WebSocket, and under what circumstances would it not be possible to do so?'
      answer: |
       'Configuring the `bridgeErrorHandler` option as true for an Apache Camel component using the Atmosphere-WebSocket can be beneficial when you want to handle exceptions that occur during message pickup by the Camel consumer in a more structured manner, rather than logging them at WARN or ERROR level and ignoring them. This is possible if the third-party component allows Camel to be notified of an exception being thrown, as it enables the handling of these exceptions as messages within the routing Error Handler. However, some components may handle exceptions internally only, making it impossible to use `bridgeErrorHandler`. In such cases, improvements to the Camel component to hook into the third-party component might be implemented for future releases to make this possible.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the Apache Camel atmosphere-websocket component to suppress the stack trace of exceptions that occur during Exchange processing on the consumer side? Is it enabled by default and what are the possible groupings for this configuration option?'
      answer: |
       'To suppress the stack trace of exceptions that occur during Exchange processing on the consumer side using Apache Camel''s atmosphere-websocket component, you can configure the "muteException" option. If set to true, the response''s body will not contain the exception''s stack trace. By default, this option is enabled. The groupings for this configuration option are under "consumer".'
    - question: 'What is the default name for the servlet when using the Apache Camel Atmosphere-WebSocket component, and is it required or optional to set this value?'
      answer: |
       'The default name for the servlet when utilizing the Apache Camel Atmosphere-WebSocket component is CamelServlet, and setting this value is optional.'
    - question: 'How do you configure the Apache Camel atmosphere-websocket component to automatically bind multipart/form-data as attachments on the Camel Exchange, and under what circumstances might this option not be applicable?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel Atmosphere-WebSocket component to automatically bind multipart/form-data as attachments on the Camel Exchange, you need to set the "attachmentMultipartBinding" option to true. However, please note that this option cannot be used simultaneously with disableStreamCache=false. If you want to use AttachmentMultipartBinding, remove the disableStreamCache configuration.              It''s important to note that by default, this option is turned off as it requires servlet-specific configuration to enable when using Servlets. This means this feature might not be applicable in scenarios where Servlets are not being used.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "fileNameExtWhitelist" option in the Apache Camel Atmosphere-WebSocket component, and is it required when using this component? Also, can you provide an example of how multiple file extensions could be specified for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "fileNameExtWhitelist" option in the Apache Camel Atmosphere-WebSocket component is designed to whitelist accepted filename extensions for uploaded files. This means that only files with extensions listed in the whitelist will be allowed for upload. If no extension is specified, no file will be accepted by default. Multiple extensions can be separated by commas; for example, "txt,xml" indicates that only files with .txt or .xml extensions are acceptable. This option is optional and belongs to the advanced group of settings under the consumer category when using this component.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel atmosphere-websocket component to use a custom HttpRegistry, and is it optional or required during setup?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel "atmosphere-websocket" component to utilize a custom `org.apache.camel.component.servlet.HttpRegistry`, you can set the "option" property to "httpRegistry". This is an optional setting during setup, not a required one, and it can be found within the "consumer (advanced)" group of options. If you wish to use your own HttpRegistry, you would include it as follows:              ```xml       <bean id="myCustomHttpRegistry" class="org.apache.camel.component.servlet.HttpRegistry">           <!-- Configure your custom HttpRegistry here -->       </bean>              <route>           <from uri="atmosphere-websocket:myEndpoint">               <!-- Route logic here -->           </from>           <propertyRef ref="myCustomHttpRegistry" name="httpRegistry" />       </route>       ```'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel atmosphere-websocket component, and why might it be beneficial to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Atmosphere Websocket component is designed to allow for lazy initialization of producers. By default, it''s set to false. Setting this option to true can be beneficial when the producer may fail during the initial startup of the CamelContext or routes, causing them to fail as well.              In cases where a failure during startup might occur, setting "lazyStartProducer" to true allows the startup failure to be handled through Camel''s routing error handlers instead. However, it''s important to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some additional time, which could prolong the total processing time of the route. This trade-off can be useful in situations where ensuring a successful startup outweighs potential performance impacts during message processing.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "allowJavaSerializedObject" option when using the Apache Camel Atmosphere-Websocket component, and under what circumstances might it pose a potential security risk?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "allowJavaSerializedObject" option in the Apache Camel Atmosphere-Websocket component is set to false. This option determines whether to allow Java serialization when a request uses context-type=application/x-java-serialized-object.              Enabling this option allows Java to deserialize the incoming data from the request, which can be a potential security risk as it bypasses the Camel''s built-in JSON binding and opens up possibilities for serialization attacks. Therefore, it is recommended to use this feature only under advanced or specific circumstances where explicit serialization is necessary, and always with caution to mitigate any potential security risks.'
    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the autowiredEnabled option in the Apache Camel atmosphere-websocket component impact the automatic configuration of external resources like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, etc., and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel atmosphere-websocket component allows for automatic configuration of external resources such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, and so on. When this option is set to true, Camel will look up in the registry for a single instance of matching type for these autowired options. If found, it will be configured on the component automatically. Conversely, disabling it means that Camel will not perform such automatic configuration. The default value for this option is true, which implies that Camel performs automatic configuration by default unless explicitly overridden.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom HttpBinding in Apache Camel''s Atmosphere-WebSocket component to manage the mapping between Camel messages and the HttpClient?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom HttpBinding in Apache Camel''s Atmosphere-WebSocket component for managing the mapping between Camel messages and HttpClient, you can set the "httpBinding" option to an object of your choice. This object will define your custom HttpBinding. However, it''s important to note that this is considered an advanced feature and the default value for this option is null. You can find more information about how to create and use a custom HttpBinding in the ''advanced'' group of Camel documentation.'
    - question: 'How can I set a custom HttpConfiguration when using the Apache Camel Atmosphere Websocket component, and is it optional or required to do so?'
      answer: |
       'To use a custom HttpConfiguration with the Apache Camel Atmosphere Websocket component, you can set it as an option during configuration. However, it''s not required as the shared HttpConfiguration can be used as a base configuration by default. If you wish to specify a custom HttpConfiguration, you can do so by passing an object as the value for the "httpConfiguration" option in your component settings. This feature is part of the advanced group of options in Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "headerFilterStrategy" option in the Apache Camel component "atmosphere-websocket", and can it be set to a custom implementation of `org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy` if provided, or does it have a default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "headerFilterStrategy" option in the Apache Camel component "atmosphere-websocket" serves the purpose of allowing you to use a custom implementation of `org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy` to filter headers both to and from Camel messages. If a custom strategy is provided, it will be used; otherwise, it does not have a default value.'
    - question: 'How does the "chunked" option in the Apache Camel Atmosphere Websocket component affect the behavior of a Servlet, and is it necessary for HTTP streaming when set to false?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s Atmosphere Websocket component, the "chunked" option determines whether HTTP streaming is enabled in your Servlet. If the "chunked" option is set to false, it will disable HTTP streaming functionality, which means that the Servlet will set the content-length header on the response instead of streaming data. This behavior allows for efficient transfer of large amounts of data by sending smaller parts (chunks) rather than all at once. However, setting "chunked" to false does not make HTTP streaming necessary when disabled. It simply changes the way data is sent from the Servlet to the client. Whether you need to use it or not would depend on your specific application requirements and desired behavior.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "disableStreamCache" option in the Apache Camel atmosphere-websocket component, and when should it be set to true for optimal performance?'
      answer: |
       'The "disableStreamCache" option in the Apache Camel atmosphere-websocket component determines whether or not the raw input stream is cached or not. Setting this option to true improves performance when you need direct access to the raw stream, such as streaming it directly to a file or other persistent store. For optimal performance, consider enabling this option when using Servlet to bridge/proxy an endpoint and you do not require reading the message payload multiple times. Conversely, if you use producers (camel-http) and do not need to cache the response body stream for multiple reads, setting "disableStreamCache" to true can also be beneficial, as it uses the response stream as-is (the stream can only be read once) as the message body. By default, both input and output streams are cached in Camel; however, this option allows you to customize that behavior according to your specific use case requirements.'
    - question: 'How do you configure the Apache Camel Atmosphere Websocket component to broadcast messages to all connected clients instead of a single one, using the ''sendToAll'' option? Is it necessary to set this option and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'To broadcast messages to all connected clients using the Apache Camel Atmosphere Websocket component, you need to configure the "sendToAll" option. This option determines whether a message should be sent to all (broadcasted) or a single receiver. To set it to broadcast mode, you should set its value to true. However, setting this option is not mandatory as its default value is false. Since it''s part of the common group, you can find it in the common configuration settings when working with the Atmosphere Websocket component.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "transferException" option in the Apache Camel component Atmosphere-WebSocket affect the handling of exceptions during the exchange process, considering the potential security risks associated with Java deserializing incoming data from requests?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "transferException" option in the Apache Camel component Atmosphere-WebSocket significantly alters exception handling during the exchange process. When this option is turned on, if an Exchange fails processing on the consumer side, any exception caused will be serialized and sent back to the producer side as a `application/x-java-serialized-object` content type. On the producer side, instead of encountering an HttpOperationFailedException, the exception will be deserialized and thrown directly. However, it is essential to note that this feature carries potential security risks. Java will deserialize incoming data from requests to Java, which could potentially expose your application to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, use caution when deciding to enable this option, as it opens up the possibility of exploitation if not properly handled or secured.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "useStreaming" option in the Apache Camel component "atmosphere-websocket", and what is its default value? Is it required, and if not, under which groups can it be found?'
      answer: |
       'The "useStreaming" option in the Apache Camel component "atmosphere-websocket" enables streaming to send data as multiple text fragments instead of sending all at once. This option is set to false by default, meaning streaming is disabled by default. It''s an optional parameter that can be found under the group "common".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "headerFilterStrategy" option within the Apache Camel "atmosphere-websocket" component, and can it be used with a custom HeaderFilterStrategy? Also, what should we expect as the default value for this option, and in which group of options does it belong (common or advanced)?'
      answer: |
       'The "headerFilterStrategy" option within the Apache Camel "atmosphere-websocket" component is designed to enable the use of a custom HeaderFilterStrategy. This strategy allows you to filter headers both going into and coming out of Camel messages. By default, this option has no value (null). It belongs to the advanced group of options called "common (advanced)".'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom HttpBinding in Apache Camel''s atmosphere-websocket component to manage the mapping between Camel messages and HttpClient?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom HttpBinding for managing the mapping between Camel messages and HttpClient in Apache Camel''s atmosphere-websocket component, you can set the "option" property of the atmosphere-websocket component to "httpBinding", and provide an appropriate object as its value. This object should be defined according to the settings required by your custom HttpBinding. Note that using a custom HttpBinding is considered an advanced feature and is not required by default. You can find the relevant documentation within the common (advanced) section of Apache Camel''s atmosphere-websocket component.'
    - question: 'How do I configure the Apache Camel atmosphere-websocket component to operate in asynchronous mode using the ''async'' option, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel atmosphere-websocket component to operate in asynchronous mode, you should set the "option" property of the component to "async". The configuration looks like this:              ```xml       <atmosphereConsumer streaming="true" sync="false">           <!-- other options -->       </atmosphereConsumer>       ```              The default value for this option is `false`, meaning that the consumer will not operate in asynchronous mode by default. When set to `true`, the component will work in an asynchronous manner.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel atmosphere-websocket component to only allow WebSocket connections using specific HTTP methods, such as GET and POST, when consuming messages?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel Atmosphere-WebSocket component to only allow WebSocket connections using specific HTTP methods like GET and POST while consuming messages, you can make use of the "httpMethodRestrict" option. You can specify multiple methods separated by commas if necessary. For allowing only GET and POST, set the value as follows:              ```       httpMethodRestrict = "GET,POST"       ```              This way, Camel will only accept WebSocket connections when the corresponding HTTP method matches one of the specified options (in this case GET or POST).'
    - question: 'How do you enable or disable the option to log exceptions that occur during Camel route processing with the Apache Camel Atmosphere-WebSocket component, if the exception stack trace is not sent in the response''s body?'
      answer: |
       'To enable logging of exceptions that occur during Camel route processing with the Apache Camel Atmosphere-WebSocket component when the exception stack trace is not sent in the response''s body, you should set the "logException" option to true. This can be achieved by modifying your configuration to include the following:              ```       {"component":"atmosphere-websocket", "option":"logException", "value":true}       ```              If you want to disable exception logging, simply set the value to false:              ```       {"component":"atmosphere-websocket", "option":"logException", "value":false}       ```'
    - question: 'How does setting the `matchOnUriPrefix` option in the Apache Camel Atmosphere-WebSocket component affect the behavior of a consumer, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `matchOnUriPrefix` option in the Apache Camel Atmosphere-WebSocket component determines whether the consumer should attempt to find a target consumer by matching the URI prefix if an exact match is not found. This option allows for a level of flexibility when multiple consumers might share similar but not identical URIs. Its default value is `false`, meaning that by default, the consumer will not try to find a target consumer by matching the URI prefix if no exact match is found.'
    - question: 'In the context of using Apache Camel with the Atmosphere Websocket component, what is the purpose and default value of the "muteException" option when it comes to handling exceptions that occur on the consumer side during message processing?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using Apache Camel with the Atmosphere Websocket component, the "muteException" option serves to suppress the stack trace of exceptions that may arise during message processing on the consumer side, if enabled. By default, this option is set to false, meaning that exception stack traces are included in the response body when an Exchange fails processing. However, if you choose to enable it (by setting "muteException" to true), the response''s body will not contain the exception''s stack trace. This group of options pertains specifically to the consumer side of the component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel component "atmosphere-websocket" option called "responseBufferSize"? Additionally, is it mandatory to set this option when using the consumer group? Moreover, what data type should be used for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "responseBufferSize" option for the Apache Camel component "atmosphere-websocket" allows you to use a custom buffer size on the Jakarta Servlet response. The default value for this option is null, meaning no initial buffer size is set if not overridden. This option is not mandatory and can be set or left unset when using the consumer group. For this option, an integer data type should be used.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "servletName" option in the Apache Camel Atmosphere-WebSocket component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel Atmosphere-WebSocket component, the "servletName" option specifies the name of the servlet to be utilized. The default value for this option is CamelServlet. Providing a value for this option is not mandatory; it can be omitted if the default value suits your requirements within the consumer group.'
    - question: 'How can I configure Apache Camel''s atmosphere-websocket component to automatically bind multipart/form-data as attachments on the Camel Exchange, and what are the implications when using this option with other options like disableStreamCache?'
      answer: |
       'To automatically bind multipart/form-data as attachments on the Camel Exchange using Apache Camel''s atmosphere-websocket component, you need to set the "attachmentMultipartBinding" option to true. However, this option cannot be used simultaneously with disableStreamCache. If you wish to use AttachmentMultipartBinding, you should remove the disableStreamCache setting.              Please note that when using this configuration, it may require specific servlet configuration as this feature is turned off by default in the atmosphere-websocket component due to its potential impact on the overall system. This option falls under the "consumer (advanced)" group, meaning it might be less commonly used and requires a more advanced understanding of Camel''s components and options.'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel atmosphere-websocket component''s bridgeErrorHandler option affect error handling in Camel, and under what conditions is it possible for this feature to be utilized?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel atmosphere-websocket component allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions (if supported by the third-party component) that occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages will be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. However, this feature is only possible if the third-party component allows Camel to be alerted when an exception is thrown. If the component handles exceptions internally, the "bridgeErrorHandler" option cannot be utilized. In cases where the Camel component can be enhanced to integrate with the third-party component, this feature could be introduced in future releases. By default, the consumer uses the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to manage exceptions, which logs them at WARN or ERROR level and ignores them.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "eagerCheckContentAvailable" option in the Apache Camel Atmosphere-Websocket component, and under what circumstances should this option be turned on?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "eagerCheckContentAvailable" option in the Apache Camel Atmosphere-Websocket component is false. This option should be turned on when dealing with HTTP clients that do not send streamed data, as it enables a check to see if the HTTP requests have content even if the content-length header is 0 or not present. This feature can help avoid potential issues related to missing or incorrect content information in non-streaming scenarios.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "exceptionHandler" option in the Apache Camel atmosphere-websocket component, when it should be used, and if a custom ExceptionHandler can be implemented, and how to handle exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level by default?'
      answer: |
       'The "exceptionHandler" option in the Apache Camel atmosphere-websocket component allows you to use a custom ExceptionHandler when dealing with exceptions that occur during message exchange. This option is suitable for advanced consumers who want more control over exception handling. If the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled, then the "exceptionHandler" is not in use as it handles errors by default.              By default, the component ignores exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level. However, if you implement a custom ExceptionHandler, you can choose to handle these exceptions differently based on your specific requirements. To implement a custom ExceptionHandler, you would need to create and configure a Bean of type ExceptionHandler in your Camel context, and then reference it in the atmosphere-websocket configuration. Please refer to the Apache Camel documentation for more details on how to do this.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible usage of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel Atmosphere-WebSocket component, and why might a user choose to configure it when working with the consumer (advanced) group?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel Atmosphere-WebSocket component doesn''t have a default value. This option sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange, which essentially defines how the producer and consumer will interact in terms of message flow. A user might choose to configure it when working with the consumer (advanced) group for more complex use cases, aiming to customize the behavior of their WebSocket interactions, particularly regarding the timing and sequence of sending and receiving messages.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "fileNameExtWhitelist" option in the Apache Camel component "atmosphere-websocket", and what is its default value, data type, required status, and group it belongs to?'
      answer: |
       'The "fileNameExtWhitelist" option in the Apache Camel component "atmosphere-websocket" serves to whitelist acceptable filename extensions for uploaded files. This means that only files with extensions listed in this whitelist can be accepted. Multiple extensions can be listed, separated by commas (e.g., txt,xml). The default value for this option is null, indicating no predefined extensions. Its data type is string, and it is not a required option. This option belongs to the "consumer (advanced)" group, suggesting it may be more useful for advanced users or specific use cases.'
    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the "mapHttpMessageBody" option in the Apache Camel Atmosphere-WebSocket component affect the exchange body mapping with respect to HTTP messages, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "mapHttpMessageBody" option in the Apache Camel Atmosphere-WebSocket component means that the body of an exchange will be mapped to the HTTP body. Conversely, disabling this option prevents such HTTP mapping. The default value for this option is true, indicating that it is enabled by default. This option falls under the "consumer (advanced)" group in Apache Camel''s configuration options.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `mapHttpMessageFormUrlEncodedBody` option in the Apache Camel Atmosphere-WebSocket component to false affect its behavior, and when is it recommended to use this option in a consumer group (advanced) context?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `mapHttpMessageFormUrlEncodedBody` option in the Apache Camel Atmosphere-WebSocket component to false disables the HTTP Form Encoded body mapping feature. This means that the exchange body will not be converted into a URL-encoded format when using this component.              In an advanced consumer group context, it may be recommended to use this option when dealing with non-Form Encoded data, or when specific control over the exchange body serialization is required. By setting this value to false, developers can ensure that their custom data structures are transmitted without modification through the Atmosphere-WebSocket component. However, keep in mind that disabling this feature may require additional handling of the exchange body to accommodate the unencoded data.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `mapHttpMessageHeaders` option in the Apache Camel atmosphere-websocket component to false affect the mapping of headers between the exchange and HTTP messages?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `mapHttpMessageHeaders` option in the Apache Camel atmosphere-websocket component to false will prevent the mapping of headers between the exchange and HTTP messages. This means that any custom headers you may have set on your HTTP message will not be copied over to the exchange, and vice versa. If you want to maintain this mapping, keep the default value (true).'
    - question: 'How can you configure the Apache Camel Atmosphere-WebSocket component to enable the HTTP OPTIONS method for a particular Servlet consumer, and what is the default value of this option?'
      answer: |
       'To enable the HTTP OPTIONS method for a specific Servlet consumer using the Apache Camel Atmosphere-WebSocket component, you can set the "optionsEnabled" option to true in your configuration. By default, this option is turned off (i.e., false). This option can be found under the "consumer (advanced)" group, meaning it''s an advanced configuration setting that may not be required for basic usage. Here''s a sample config snippet:              ```xml       <atmosphere-websocket:endpoint id="myEndpoint" url="${url}" optionsEnabled="true"/>       ```'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel atmosphere-websocket component to enable or disable the HTTP TRACE method (TRACE-enabled) for its Servlet consumer? Is there a default value for this option and if so, what is it? Also, where can I find this option in the list of available configuration groups for the consumer?'
      answer: |
       'To enable or disable the HTTP TRACE method (TRACE-enabled) for the Apache Camel atmosphere-websocket component''s Servlet consumer, you can modify the "traceEnabled" option. This option is located under the "consumer (advanced)" group. Its default value is false, meaning that TRACE is turned off by default. If you wish to enable it, set this option to true in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the function of the "bridgeEndpoint" option in the Apache Camel''s Atmosphere-Websocket component, and what happens when this option is set to true compared to its default value, also explaining the effect of setting the "throwExceptionOnFailure" option to false?'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s Atmosphere-Websocket component, the "bridgeEndpoint" option allows you to configure how HttpProducer utilizes the Exchange.HTTP_URI header. When set to true, this option instructs the HttpProducer to disregard the Exchange.HTTP_URI header and instead use the endpoint''s URI for requesting data. This can be particularly useful when dealing with complex routing scenarios.              Additionally, if you choose to set "throwExceptionOnFailure" to false, the HttpProducer will stop throwing exceptions in response to request failures. Instead, it will return all fault responses, enabling your application to handle or process these responses in a more customized manner. This can help prevent the application from abruptly terminating due to unhandled exceptions.'
    - question: 'How does setting the Apache Camel "lazyStartProducer" option in the "atmosphere-websocket" component affect the behavior of the producer and the overall route startup, and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "lazyStartProducer" option to true in the Apache Camel "atmosphere-websocket" component allows you to defer the startup of the producer until the first message is processed. This can be beneficial in situations where starting the producer might cause the route to fail during startup, as errors can then be handled through Camel''s routing error handlers.              However, keep in mind that when the first message is processed and the producer is created and started, this may take additional time, thereby prolonging the total processing time of the route. By default, the "lazyStartProducer" option is set to false, meaning that the producer starts up during the CamelContext and route startup.'
