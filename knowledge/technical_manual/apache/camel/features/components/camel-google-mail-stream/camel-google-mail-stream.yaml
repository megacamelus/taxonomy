    - question: 'What is the purpose and optional nature of the "applicationName" option within the Apache Camel''s Google Mail Stream component (`google-mail-stream`), and what should be expected when no value is provided for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "applicationName" option within Apache Camel''s Google Mail Stream component (`google-mail-stream`) is an optional setting that specifies the name of the Google mail application, such as `camel-google-mail/1.0`. If no value is provided for this option, it means that the default Google mail application name is not being explicitly set and Camel will use its internal mechanisms to determine the appropriate Google application name.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel''s google-mail-stream component allow for exception handling, compared to the default behavior when this option is set to false?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in Apache Camel''s google-mail-stream component enables exception handling that goes beyond the default behavior when this option is set to false. When "bridgeErrorHandler" is enabled, exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages will be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. In contrast, with the default setting (false), any exceptions will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and then ignored. The primary benefit of enabling "bridgeErrorHandler" is that it offers more control over how exceptions are handled, making it easier to respond appropriately when issues arise in the consumer.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value, if any, of the "clientId" option within the Apache Camel "google-mail-stream" component, and is it a required or optional setting?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option within the Apache Camel "google-mail-stream" component is an optional setting used to provide the Client ID of your mail application. Its default value is null if not explicitly specified. This setting is grouped under the "consumer".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel''s Google Mail Stream component when using a wide-domain service account, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "delegate" option in the Apache Camel''s Google Mail Stream component, when used with a wide-domain service account, serves the purpose of delegating permissions for that account. This option allows you to use a secondary account with specific permissions to perform operations on behalf of the primary service account. By default, this option does not have a preset value, meaning it can be set according to your specific requirements. Regarding its necessity, using the "delegate" option is optional; whether to include it depends on your use case and the desired level of delegation in your workflow.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "labels" option in the Apache Camel "google-mail-stream" component, and is it a required setting?'
      answer: |
       'The "labels" option in the Apache Camel "google-mail-stream" component is used to specify a comma-separated list of labels for the emails you''re interested in. By default, no labels are applied (defaultValue: null). This setting is optional, meaning it can be provided or skipped during the configuration. It falls under the consumer group of settings in this component.'
    - question: 'Can you explain what the purpose of setting the `markAsRead` option to false when using the `google-mail-stream` component in Apache Camel, if that option is optional and its default value is true?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `markAsRead` option to false in the `google-mail-stream` component of Apache Camel, though optional with a default value of true, indicates that you wish to prevent the message from being marked as read once it has been consumed. This can be useful if you want to keep track of messages that have not yet been processed or require further action.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "maxResults" option when using the Apache Camel component Google Mail Stream, and is it required when setting up a consumer? Also, what type of value should this option contain?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "maxResults" option when working with the Apache Camel component Google Mail Stream is 10. However, this parameter is not required to set up a consumer, as it can be used to define the maximum number of results to return in one request. It is essential to note that the type of value this option should contain is an integer.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the ''query'' option in the Apache Camel ''google-mail-stream'' component when executing a search query on a Gmail box, and is it mandatory to provide this value?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the ''query'' option in the Apache Camel ''google-mail-stream'' component, when executing a search query on a Gmail box, is "is:unread". Providing this value is not mandatory as it can be set to a custom string if preferred, but leaving it empty will default to "is:unread".'
    - question: 'What is the default setting for the "raw" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream", and does it require being set if not explicitly overridden?'
      answer: |
       'The default setting for the "raw" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" is false, and it doesn''t necessarily need to be set if not explicitly overridden as it has a default value.'
    - question: 'What are the available GMail scopes for configuring the ''scopes'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-mail-stream'', and is it mandatory to provide a default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The GMail scopes available for configuring the ''scopes'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-mail-stream'' include:              * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/mail.compose` to send emails using the API       * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify` for modifying messages (e.g. moving them)       * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly` to read email headers and bodies       * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts.readonly` for reading contacts              However, it is not mandatory to provide a default value for the ''scopes'' option as indicated by the ''defaultValue'': null in the configuration.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel''s google-mail-stream component affect the automatic configuration of options such as data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, and how does this option work, including its default value and whether it is required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in Apache Camel''s google-mail-stream component allows for automatic configuration of options such as data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, among others. When set to true (its default value), this option triggers a search in the component''s registry for a single instance of matching type for the specified options (marked as autowired). Once found, it configures that instance on the component. This simplifies the process of configuration for complex resources like databases, messaging services, and cloud clients, by removing the need to explicitly configure each resource individually, thereby improving code maintainability and reducing the potential for errors. However, using this option is considered an advanced feature, as it''s only required when explicit configuration isn''t suitable or convenient.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientFactory" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component, and is its use considered an advanced feature?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientFactory" option within the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component serves as a factory for creating instances of the Google API clients. While it doesn''t have a default value, it can be set when configuring your routes to customize client creation if needed. Its use is considered an advanced feature as it provides more control over client initialization in complex scenarios or specific requirements.'
    - question: 'What are the possible configurations for the "configuration" option within the "google-mail-stream" component of the Apache Camel library in its advanced settings, and is it optional? Furthermore, is there a default value set for this configuration, or can it be left empty?'
      answer: |
       'The "configuration" option within the "google-mail-stream" component of the Apache Camel library in its advanced settings is an optional object that allows you to configure the behavior of the Google Mail Stream component. This configuration does not have a default value (defaultValue: null). As it is marked as "optional" (required: false), leaving it empty is feasible, but setting values can tailor the component''s functioning to your specific use case. The exact keys and their corresponding types within this object are dependent on the specific configurations you want to set; these will be detailed in the component''s documentation or example configurations. Grouped under "advanced" settings, these configuration options offer more control for integrating with Google Mail Stream effectively.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel "google-mail-stream" component, and under what circumstances might it be useful to set its value to false?'
      answer: |
       'The "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel "google-mail-stream" component is a boolean property, with a default value of true. Its primary function is to enable or disable all consumer-based health checks for this component. Setting its value to false might be beneficial if you have a scenario where continuous health check operations are causing unnecessary resource usage or interfering with your application''s normal operation, especially during periods of high load. However, it is important to note that disabling health checks may impact the overall reliability and fault tolerance of your system, as they serve to monitor component health and maintain service resilience. Always consider the trade-offs between performance, stability, and resiliency when making decisions regarding this configuration option.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the option "healthCheckProducerEnabled" in the Apache Camel component named ''google-mail-stream'', regarding its influence on producer based health checks, and whether it can be configured globally using a Camel property?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component called ''google-mail-stream'', the option "healthCheckProducerEnabled" is used to control whether all producer-based health checks are enabled or disabled from this specific component. By default, it is set to true, which means that producer checks are enabled for this component.              You can configure the behavior of producer checks globally across all components using a Camel property named "camel.health.producersEnabled". If you set "camel.health.producersEnabled=true", it will turn on producer checks globally, meaning all components will use producer-based health checks if they support them. If not specified, Camel has its own default behavior of disabling all producer-based health-checks.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''accessToken'' option within the Apache Camel component ''google-mail-stream'', and why would it be advisable to use the ''refreshToken'' in scenarios requiring long term usage?'
      answer: |
       'The ''accessToken'' option within the Apache Camel component ''google-mail-stream'' is an OAuth 2 access token used to authorize actions on Google Mail API. However, this token expires after an hour, making it less suitable for long-term usage. To overcome this limitation, it is advisable to utilize the ''refreshToken'' for scenarios requiring long-term access, as the refresh token can be used to obtain a new access token when the original one has expired.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel "google-mail-stream" component, and is it required or optional to provide a value for this option when setting up the configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel "google-mail-stream" component is a security key used within the mail application. Its purpose is to authenticate and authorize your application to access Google Mail services. However, it''s important to note that the default value for this option is null, meaning you need to provide your own client secret when setting up the configuration if you wish to use this feature.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the "refreshToken" option in Apache Camel''s "google-mail-stream" component to ensure the Google Calendar component can obtain a new access token when the current one expires, for long-lived applications?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the "refreshToken" option for Apache Camel''s "google-mail-stream" component, you need to provide a refresh token string. This refresh token can be used by the Google Calendar component to obtain a new access token whenever the current one expires, thus ensuring its functionality in long-lived applications. The "refreshToken" option is part of the security group and can be set as follows:              ```       googleMailStreamComponent.setProperty("google.oauth2RefreshToken", "<your_refresh_token>");       ```'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream", and where should a valid .json file containing Service Account credentials be provided when this option is set?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" is intended to provide a path or URL to a JSON file containing Service Account credentials. This file allows authentication with Google services, such as Gmail. When you set this option to a valid .json file, make sure to place it appropriately so that your application can read it. The location could be a relative or absolute file system path on your server, or even a URL pointing to the JSON file hosted online if needed. It is recommended to handle this credential file securely due to its sensitive nature and follow best practices for securing API keys.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel''s google-mail-stream component, and what is its default value if a user does not specify it? Also, is it mandatory to provide this information when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel''s "google-mail-stream" component is designed to allow you to specify the name of the Google mail application, such as "camel-google-mail/1.0". If a user does not provide this value explicitly, there is no default value assigned to it and it can remain blank. However, specifying the applicationName option is optional when using this component within consumer groups.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the `clientId` option in the Apache Camel''s `google-mail-stream` component, and is it required?'
      answer: |
       'The `clientId` option in Apache Camel''s `google-mail-stream` component is used to specify the Client ID of your Google Mail application. By default, it has no value (`defaultValue'': null). Whether you provide a Client ID or not (it''s marked as "optional" and not required, i.e., `required'': false). This option belongs to the consumer group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" serves the purpose of delegating for a wide-domain service account. This option allows you to manage multiple domains under one single Google Workspace (G Suite) account. However, it''s important to note that this option has no default value and is not required when using this component as it can function without delegate configuration, but its use may provide additional functionalities in managing multiple domains.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, and group associated with the "labels" option in the Apache Camel component named ''google-mail-stream''? Also, is it a required field? If yes, does it have a specific data type?'
      answer: |
       'The "labels" option in the Apache Camel component named ''google-mail-stream'' is designed to allow you to specify a comma-separated list of labels to consider when interacting with Gmail mail streams. By default, this field has no specific value (defaultValue: null). The group associated with this option is "consumer". Lastly, it is not a required field and if used, the data type should be string.'
    - question: 'How does the "markAsRead" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" operate, what is its default value and can it be configured to be non-required?'
      answer: |
       'The "markAsRead" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" functions by marking a received email as read after it has been consumed. By default, this option is set to true, meaning that once an email is processed, it will be marked as read. However, it can also be configured to be non-required, allowing the system to behave differently if desired. This setting belongs to the "consumer" group of options in Camel''s google-mail-stream component.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum number of email results that can be returned at once when using the "maxResults" option with the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream", if a default value is used and this option is not required?'
      answer: |
       'The maximum number of email results that can be returned at once when using the "maxResults" option with the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" is 10, as it uses a default value of 10 and this option is not required.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "query" option in the Apache Camel''s Google Mail Stream component, and is it required to be set when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "query" option in Apache Camel''s Google Mail Stream component is "is:unread", and it is not required to be set when using this component.'
    - question: 'What is the default value of the "raw" option in the Apache Camel component Google-Mail-Stream, and is it required to use this option when consuming emails?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "raw" option in the Apache Camel component Google-Mail-Stream is false. Using this option to store entire email messages in RFC 2822 format and base64url encoding within the Camel message body is optional.'
    - question: 'What are the possible GMail scopes that can be specified for the ''scopes'' option in the Apache Camel component named "google-mail-stream", and is the specification of this option considered required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "GMail scopes" option within the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" allows you to specify certain permissions for your application when accessing the user''s Gmail account. The possible GMail scopes that can be specified include but are not limited to: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/mail.compose`, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`, and `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`. The specification of the "scopes" option is considered optional; you can set it to null or choose not to set it at all, in which case the default value (implied scopes) will be used by Apache Camel during communication with Google Mail API.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel "google-mail-stream" component and what is its default value, as well as whether it''s mandatory to use this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel "google-mail-stream" component allows you to configure the behavior of the polling consumer when no files are polled. When set to true, an empty message (no body) will be sent if no files are available. If left at its default value of false, no empty message will be sent in such a case. Using this option is optional and not mandatory.'
    - question: 'How can we configure the "bridgeErrorHandler" option for the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" to bridge consumer exceptions to the Camel routing Error Handler, if the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown? Is it possible to change the default behavior of logging warnings or errors and ignoring exceptions when this feature is not enabled?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the "bridgeErrorHandler" option for the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream," you need to ensure that the third-party Google Mail API allows Camel to be informed if an exception was thrown during operation. If this condition is met, you can set the "bridgeErrorHandler" value to true in your route''s configuration:              ```       from("google-mail-stream://...")           .errorHandler(new BridgeErrorHandler()) // replace with your implementation of org.apache.camel.spi.ErrorHandler           ...       ```              In this example, a custom ErrorHandler (deriving from `org.apache.camel.spi.ErrorHandler`) implementing the bridgeErrorHandler functionality is used. If the third-party component does not support the bridgeErrorHandler feature or it is not possible to enable it, the default consumer behavior will log warnings and errors at WARN or ERROR level and ignore exceptions.'
    - question: 'What is the functionality of the exceptionHandler option in the Apache Camel google-mail-stream component and how can a custom ExceptionHandler be implemented when using this option? Is it mandatory to implement this option, and under what circumstances will the default behavior of ignoring exceptions apply?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component, the exceptionHandler option allows you to utilize a custom ExceptionHandler should you prefer one over the default error handling. If the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled, the exceptionHandler option won''t be in effect as it takes care of exceptions. By default, if no exceptionHandler is provided, Camel will manage errors that are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignore them. However, implementing a custom ExceptionHandler is not mandatory. Its usage is categorized under advanced consumer group settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-mail-stream", which can be configured under the category "consumer (advanced)"? Furthermore, how might you change this setting when creating a consumer?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component called "google-mail-stream," the "exchangePattern" option determines the messaging pattern to be followed when the consumer creates an exchange. By default, it has no preset value, which allows you to set it according to your specific needs when configuring the component. To change this setting when creating a consumer in the advanced category of "consumer (advanced)," you can provide an object specifying the desired exchange pattern for communication between your application and Google Mail. The exchangePattern option facilitates customizing how the messages flow through your application and Google Mail, enhancing its flexibility to suit your integration requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `pollStrategy` option within the Apache Camel component `google-mail-stream`, and how can a custom implementation be provided for this option to control error handling during poll operations before an Exchange is created in Camel?'
      answer: |
       'The `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel `google-mail-stream` component allows you to supply a custom implementation of the `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy`. This feature provides flexibility in managing error handling that typically occurs during the poll operation before an Exchange has been created and routed in Camel. If you wish to provide a custom implementation for this option, you can do so by implementing the specified `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy` interface and configure it appropriately according to your error handling requirements within the advanced consumer group of the component''s configuration settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "backoffErrorThreshold" option within the "google-mail-stream" component in Apache Camel, and under what group of options can it be found if it''s not required?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffErrorThreshold" option within the "google-mail-stream" component in Apache Camel is an integer value that specifies the number of subsequent error polls (failures due to errors) before the "backoffMultipler" should be activated. Its default value is null, meaning it doesn''t have a predefined value if not explicitly set. This option belongs to the "scheduler" group of options and can be found there when it''s not required in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) for the option "backoffIdleThreshold" in the Apache Camel component named "google-mail-stream", and is it part of the scheduler group options?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-mail-stream" determines the number of consecutive idle polls that should occur before the "backoffMultipler" is applied. It''s an integer type and does not have a default value (defaultValue: null). This option belongs to the scheduler group, which contains settings related to the component''s scheduling mechanism.'
    - question: 'How does setting the "backoffMultiplier" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" impact the behavior of a scheduled polling consumer when there are consecutive idle or error events, and what values should be configured for the options "backoffIdleThreshold" and/or "backoffErrorThreshold" if the user decides to use "backoffMultiplier"?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "backoffMultiplier" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" allows a scheduled polling consumer to temporarily pause or "backoff" when there have been multiple consecutive idle or error events. The number specified for "backoffMultiplier" indicates the number of skipped polls before the next attempt is made again. If this option is in use, it''s essential to also configure the options "backoffIdleThreshold" (for idle events) and/or "backoffErrorThreshold" (for error events). These thresholds define the number of idle or error events required consecutively before the backoff process is initiated. The specific values for these thresholds can be determined based on your application''s specific requirements, such as desired recovery time, resilience, and system performance.'
    - question: 'What is the default millisecond interval (in seconds) between polls when using the ''delay'' option of the Apache Camel "google-mail-stream" component in the context of a scheduler, and is it possible to modify this value if so, how can it be customized?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the "delay" option with the Apache Camel "google-mail-stream" component within a scheduler group, the default interval between polls is 500 milliseconds (or 0.5 seconds), as indicated by the "defaultValue": 500. This interval can indeed be customized if needed. To modify this value, you would need to provide an integer value that represents your desired millisecond delay, ensuring it''s compatible with the component and scheduler configuration. For instance, if you wanted a polling interval of 1 second (1000 milliseconds), you could specify the "delay": 1000 option within your configuration file or code. Adjust this value according to your specific requirements, but remember that lower intervals may increase load while higher intervals may cause potential delays in processing new mail events.'
    - question: 'What is the effect on the scheduling of a Google Mail Stream consumer when the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel''s "google-mail-stream" component is set to true?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "greedy" option on the Apache Camel''s "google-mail-stream" component will cause the ScheduledPollConsumer to execute immediately if it retrieved one or more messages during its previous run, thus accelerating the frequency of message processing from your specified schedule. If you do not intend for this behavior and prefer a regular scheduling, leave the "greedy" option set to false.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" option called "initialDelay", which denotes the time in milliseconds before the first polling operation begins? Is this option required during configuration and if so, does it belong to a specific group of options?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" option named "initialDelay" is an integer type with a value of 1000 milliseconds (or one second). This option represents the time before the first poll starts, and its usage is optional during configuration. It belongs to the scheduler group of options in your configuration setup.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "repeatCount" option in the Apache Camel Google-Mail-Stream component under the scheduler group, and when would setting a positive integer value limit the number of times this component will fire?'
      answer: |
       'The "repeatCount" option in the Apache Camel Google-Mail-Stream component within the scheduler group specifies a maximum limit for the number of times the component will fire. This limit is set as an integer, with a positive integer value restricting the number of fires. For instance, if you set it to 5, the scheduler will only fire five times. If you want it to fire infinitely, you can set it to zero or use negative values. The default value for "repeatCount" is 0, meaning that the component will continuously fire unless explicitly stopped or limited by other means.'
    - question: 'What is the default logging level for the "start/complete" log lines generated by the Apache Camel''s Google Mail Stream component when it polls, and which logging levels can be configured for these logs if needed?'
      answer: |
       'The default logging level for the "start/complete" log lines generated by the Apache Camel''s Google Mail Stream component when it polls is TRACE. If you need to configure the logging level for these log lines, you can do so using the "runLoggingLevel" option in the component configuration.'
    - question: 'How can you configure a custom or shared thread pool for the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component''s consumer using the scheduledExecutorService option, and is it required? (If not, does it have a default value?)'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom or shared thread pool for the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component''s consumer, you can utilize the "scheduledExecutorService" option. This allows for setting up a specified thread pool that can be shared among consumers, deviating from the default behavior where each consumer operates on its individual single-threaded thread pool. However, the usage of this option is optional as it has no default value. You will need to provide your own configuration when you want to leverage this feature, as indicated under the "scheduler" group.'
    - question: 'What is the recommended approach to configure a scheduling option (specifically, the "google-mail-stream" component''s "scheduler" option) using either the camel-spring or camel-quartz component in Apache Camel, and how can you provide a cron expression for the scheduler?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a scheduling option for the "google-mail-stream" component using either the camel-spring or camel-quartz component in Apache Camel, simply set the value of the "scheduler" option to either "spring" or "quartz". For built-in schedulers, these values correspond to camel-spring''s and camel-quartz''s respective cron schedulers. If you choose to use a cron expression, you can specify it when setting the value for the "cronExpression" option, which is optional within the "scheduler" group. For instance, if you wish to run your mail stream component daily at midnight (0 0 * * *), set the options as follows:       ```bash       google-mail-stream{         scheduler = ''spring'' // or ''quartz''         cronExpression = ''0 0 * * *''       }       ```'
    - question: 'How can you set additional properties when using a custom scheduler with the Apache Camel Google-Mail Stream component (google-mail-stream), specifically for the option "schedulerProperties"? Is there an example of how to provide such properties and what data types are accepted for these properties?'
      answer: |
       'To set additional properties when using a custom scheduler with the Apache Camel Google-Mail Stream component (google-mail-stream), specifically for the option "schedulerProperties", you can configure an object with required or optional key-value pairs. The "schedulerProperties" option accepts objects as its value and this configuration is optional within the "scheduler" group.              Here''s an example of how to provide such properties:              ```json       {           schedulerProperties: {               cronExpression: "0 0/5 12 * * ?", // Quartz Cron expression               fixedDelay: 60000, // delay in milliseconds before each task is triggered (Spring-based scheduler)               fixedRate: 60000, // rate in milliseconds between first and subsequent tasks (Spring-based scheduler)               // other valid properties as per your custom scheduler requirements           }       }       ```              Data types accepted for these properties are primarily strings, numbers (integers), and Boolean values. For Quartz-specific cron expressions or Spring-based scheduling configurations, ensure that the provided expressions conform to their respective standards.'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel component ''google-mail-stream'' handle the starting of its scheduler when using the option ''startScheduler'', and what is its default behavior? Is it required for this option to be set explicitly, and are there specific groups that this option belongs to?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel component ''google-mail-stream'' will auto-start its scheduler if the option ''startScheduler'' is not explicitly set. In other words, it defaults to ''true''. If you wish to disable the autostart of the scheduler, you can set the option ''startScheduler'' to false. This option falls under the group "scheduler".'
    - question: 'What is the default time unit used in the "initialDelay" and "delay" options when using the "timeUnit" attribute with the Apache Camel''s "google-mail-stream" component, if not explicitly specified? Also, what data type does this time unit option take and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel''s "google-mail-stream" component, when no specific time unit is specified for the "initialDelay" and "delay" options, the default time unit is Milliseconds (MILLISECONDS). The time unit option takes an object data type, and it is optional, meaning you can provide it or not when using this component.'
    - question: 'How does the use of the "useFixedDelay" option within the Apache Camel''s Google Mail Stream component impact its scheduling behavior, and is it set to true by default?'
      answer: |
       'The "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel''s Google Mail Stream component determines whether a fixed delay or fixed rate is applied for scheduling its operations. This setting essentially governs the time interval between the consecutive execution of the component, with the fixed delay meaning the elapsed time after the task completion before another run initiates, whereas a fixed rate signifies that the component will run at regular intervals irrespective of the completion status of the previous instance. The Google Mail Stream component is set to use a fixed delay by default in its scheduling behavior, following the configuration found in Java''s ScheduledExecutorService.'
    - question: 'What should be used as the OAuth 2 access token when using the "google-mail-stream" component in Apache Camel, and why might it be advisable to use a refreshToken for long term usage instead?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of utilizing the "google-mail-stream" component within Apache Camel, you should provide an OAuth 2 access token. However, considering the default lifetime of around an hour for these tokens, it''s generally advised to use a refreshToken instead, particularly for long-term usage. This is because refreshTokens can be used to obtain a new access token when the initial one expires or is no longer valid. This practice ensures continuous authentication and streamlined interaction with Google Mail APIs over an extended period.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component called "google-mail-stream", and is it considered a required or optional configuration parameter? Additionally, where might you typically find this client secret when setting up Google Mail integration using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-mail-stream" serves as the secret key of the mail application. This value is not set by default (defaultValue: null). The use of clientSecret is optional rather than required in the configuration parameters. In terms of security, it falls under the group "security". When setting up Google Mail integration using this component, you would typically find and input your unique client secret from your Google API Console project settings.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel "google-mail-stream" component to automatically refresh the OAuth 2 access token when it expires, and what data type should be provided for this configuration option?'
      answer: |
       'To automatically refresh the OAuth 2 access token when it expires in your Apache Camel "google-mail-stream" component, you can configure the "refreshToken" option. This string type configuration value enables the component to obtain a new accessToken upon the expiration of the current one. It is important for applications that require long-term use of the Google Calendar API. Please ensure this setting falls under the security group during configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and description, default value (if any), data type, required status, and applicable group of the option "serviceAccountKey" in the Apache Camel component called "google-mail-stream"? Additionally, can you explain what the .json file with credentials for a Service account refers to in this context?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceAccountKey" option within the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" is designed to provide a .json file containing service account credentials. Its purpose is to authenticate your application using Google''s service accounts for sending emails. By default, it does not have a specific default value; it can be left null if not provided explicitly. The data type of this option is "string", and its required status is marked as false, meaning you do not necessarily need to provide this option in every use case. Regarding the .json file with credentials for a service account, these credentials are used by your application to authenticate as that specific Google service account when interacting with the Google Mail API.'
