seed_examples:
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component, and is it required when configuring this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component is intended to specify the name of the Google mail application, such as camel-google-mail/1.0. However, it does not have a default value, meaning you are free to set it according to your needs when configuring this component. It''s worth noting that the "applicationName" option is not required; its inclusion in the configuration is optional.'
    - question: 'How does the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel google-mail-stream component work, and what are the implications when it is set to true compared to its default value (false)?'
      answer: |
       'The `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel Google-Mail-Stream component allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. When set to true, any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages will be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. This is only possible if the third-party component permits Camel to be informed of an exception being thrown. If not, the default behavior (false) will use the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler` to manage exceptions, logging them at WARN or ERROR level and ignoring them.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" is used to specify the Client ID of your Google Mail application. It''s a string type, but by default, it has no value assigned (defaultValue: null). This means you can choose to provide a Client ID when using this component, but its absence won''t cause an error; it''s an optional parameter (required: false). The "clientId" falls under the "consumer" group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream"? Also, is it required and which group does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" serves the purpose of delegating access for a wide-domain service account. It allows you to specify a user who can send emails on behalf of the service account. By default, it does not have a set value (defaultValue: null). This option is not required, meaning you can choose whether or not to provide a value for it. The "delegate" option belongs to the "consumer" group of options.'
    - question: 'How can I specify a comma-separated list of labels to filter Google Mail messages in an Apache Camel route using the google-mail-stream component, and is it required?'
      answer: |
       'To specify a comma-separated list of labels for filtering Google Mail messages within an Apache Camel route utilizing the "google-mail-stream" component, you can set the "labels" option in the configuration of the component to your desired label values (e.g., "label1, label2, label3"). This option is optional, meaning that providing a value for it is not required if you wish to process all labels without filtering.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and whether it''s required for the "markAsRead" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component when consuming messages, and can this option be configured to be disabled?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the "markAsRead" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component is that it''s set to true, meaning messages are automatically marked as read once they have been consumed. However, this option is not required, so you can choose whether or not to use it when consuming messages. You can also configure this option to be disabled if needed.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the optional "maxResults" configuration parameter in the Apache Camel''s Google Mail Stream component, and under which group can this option be found?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional "maxResults" configuration parameter in Apache Camel''s Google Mail Stream component is an integer 10. This option, which determines the maximum number of results to be returned, can be found under the consumer group.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "query" option when using the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream", and is it required in the configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "query" option when using the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" is "is:unread". It''s not a required field in the configuration, meaning you can choose to provide your own custom query if needed.'
    - question: 'How can you configure Apache Camel''s Google Mail Stream component to store the entire email message as an RFC 2822 formatted and base64url encoded string in the message body, if this is not the default behavior?'
      answer: |
       'To configure Apache Camel''s Google Mail Stream component to store the entire email message as an RFC 2822 formatted and base64url encoded string in the message body when it''s currently not set as the default, you need to set the "component" option to "google-mail-stream", the "option" to "raw", and the value to true (as a boolean). In your Camel configuration, this would look like:              ```java       .from("google-mail-stream:[your_email_settings]")       .to("direct:processEmail")       .options().setBodyType(BodyType.String) // since the value will be a string       .option(Exchange.GOOGLE_RAW, true); // set the raw option to true       ```              Ensure your Camel consumer group is also set as "consumer" for these settings to take effect.'
    - question: 'What are the available GMail scopes for the Apache Camel''s Google Mail Stream component when specifying the ''scopes'' option, and is it a required or optional configuration parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The available Gmail scopes for the Apache Camel''s Google Mail Stream component when specifying the ''scopes'' option are as follows: "GMail scopes". This option is an array, meaning you can specify multiple scopes if needed. It''s an optional configuration parameter, which means you don''t necessarily need to provide it during setup.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream", and can this option be set to false if desired?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream," the "autowiredEnabled" option is designed for enabling or disabling automatic autowiring of options. By default, it''s set to true, meaning that autowiring is activated. This feature allows Camel to look up in the registry for a single instance of matching type and configure it on the component automatically. This can be useful for auto-configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, and other similar components. If you wish to disable this behavior, you can set "autowiredEnabled" to false in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientFactory" option in the advanced settings group for the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component? Additionally, is it optional or required and what type of data does this option accept?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientFactory" option in the advanced settings group for the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component serves as a factory to create Google Client instances. It allows customization of the client creation process, such as configuring specific scopes or authentication methods. By default, it does not have a preset value, meaning you need to provide your own implementation. The type of data this option accepts is an object following certain method signatures for creating Google clients. Its usage is optional, as indicated by the "required": false in its definition.'
    - question: 'What is the default configuration for the "configuration" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default configuration for the "configuration" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" is not provided (defaultValue: null). It is optional and falls under the advanced group of settings, meaning it''s not necessary to use this configuration when initializing the component. Please consult your specific use case or documentation for guidance on how to configure this option if needed.'
    - question: '"What is the default value and purpose of the ''healthCheckConsumerEnabled'' option within the Apache Camel ''google-mail-stream'' component, and under what circumstances might it be useful to disable this feature?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''healthCheckConsumerEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel ''google-mail-stream'' component is a boolean property that determines whether consumer-based health checks are enabled or disabled for this component. Its default value is true, meaning all consumer health checks are active by default. This feature helps monitor the status and performance of the component.              Disabling this option (by setting it to false) might be useful in specific scenarios such as when you want to suppress health check failures from affecting the overall system''s health status or if you have custom health monitoring mechanisms in place that don''t require consumer-based checks. However, it''s important to note that disabling these checks could impact the system''s ability to automatically recover from errors or identify issues with the component.'
    - question: 'Can you explain the purpose of the option "healthCheckProducerEnabled" in the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component and whether it needs to be explicitly enabled or disabled? Also, what is its default value and under which configuration group can this option be found?'
      answer: |
       'The option "healthCheckProducerEnabled" within the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component serves to enable or disable all producer-based health checks from this specific component. By default, Camel has disabled all producer-based health checks. However, you can choose to enable these checks globally by setting "camel.health.producersEnabled=true". This option falls under the "health" configuration group and can be found within your Apache Camel configuration settings. Whether it needs to be explicitly enabled or disabled depends on your specific application requirements regarding health monitoring of the producer.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream", and why is it recommended to use "refreshToken" for long-term usage instead?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" is an OAuth 2 access token used for authorization when interacting with Google Mail APIs. This token typically expires after an hour, making it unsuitable for long-term usage. To ensure consistent and continuous access to the APIs over a longer period, it''s recommended to use the "refreshToken" instead, which can be used to refresh the access token when it expires.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and required status of the "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream", and under which group does this option fall within the security context?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" serves as the client secret of the mail application. It is a string data type, having no default value (defaultValue: null). The required status of this option is false, meaning it is not necessary for its use but may be relevant to security contexts. This option falls under the "security" group, indicating its significance in maintaining the security of the mail application.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `refreshToken` option in the Apache Camel''s Google Mail Stream component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option in the configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The `refreshToken` option in Apache Camel''s Google Mail Stream component serves as an OAuth 2 refresh token. This token allows the Google Calendar component to obtain a new accessToken when the current one expires, which is important for long-lived applications. However, providing a value for this option is not mandatory; it can be left null if you wish to rely on other authentication methods or do not require continuous access during token expiration periods. Keep in mind that the `refreshToken` falls under the security group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and if it''s required to use the "serviceAccountKey" option in the "google-mail-stream" component of Apache Camel when using Google Mail Stream, and where should the .json file containing credentials for the Service account be provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceAccountKey" option within the "google-mail-stream" component of Apache Camel is a string-type configuration property that allows you to set a .json file with credentials for your Google Service Account. This option is not required, but its use can help authenticate your application to access Google Mail Stream services securely. The default value for this option is null. The .json file containing the credentials for the Service account should be provided in your application or Camel configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel "google-mail-stream" component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option when using this component? Also, can you give an example of a valid string value that could be used for this option if one chooses to set it?'
      answer: |
       'The "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel "google-mail-stream" component is intended to specify the name of the Google mail application being utilized. For instance, a valid example could be "camel-google-mail/1.0". Providing a value for this option is not mandatory as it has a default value of null. However, setting an appropriate value can enhance the clarity of your integration with Google Mail services if desired.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream", and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" serves as the Client ID of the mail application. It''s not mandatory to provide a value for this option, as its default value is null. However, if you wish to use this component with Google Mail, you''ll need to supply your own Client ID for authentication purposes.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" serves the purpose of delegating access for a wide-domain service account. This option, however, does not have a default value. Its inclusion is optional when utilizing this component in your setup.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "labels" option in the Apache Camel''s "google-mail-stream" component, and what is its default value, type, and whether it is required or not?'
      answer: |
       'The "labels" option in Apache Camel''s "google-mail-stream" component allows you to specify a comma-separated list of labels to take into account when dealing with Gmail messages. Its default value is null, meaning that no labels are applied by default. This option is of type string and is not required, as messages can be processed without explicitly specifying any labels. This feature falls under the consumer group in the context of component configurations.'
    - question: 'How do you configure the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component to prevent marking a message as read after consumption, if the default value for markAsRead option is set to true but it can be overridden?'
      answer: |
       'To override the default behavior of the "markAsRead" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component when consuming messages, you need to pass a custom configuration setting with a false value. Since the default value for this option is true, but it can be overridden, you can configure it as follows:              ```       component("google-mail-stream")           .property("markAsRead", "false");       ```              With this configuration, the messages will not be marked as read after consumption.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum number of email messages that can be retrieved at once when using the "maxResults" option with the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component, if no specific value is provided for this option?'
      answer: |
       'When using the "maxResults" option with the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component without providing a specific value, the default number of email messages that can be retrieved at once is 10.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "query" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream", and is it mandatory to provide a query when using this option?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "query" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" is "is:unread". It''s not mandatory to provide a query, as the option is marked as "required: false".'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "raw" option in the Apache Camel "google-mail-stream" component, and can this option be set to true or false during consumption? Also, under what group of options does this "raw" setting belong?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "raw" option in the Apache Camel "google-mail-stream" component is false. However, it can be set to either true or false during consumption. This option belongs to the group of options called "consumer". In simpler terms, when you choose this option and set it to true, the entire email message will be stored in an RFC 2822 formatted and base64url encoded string within the Camel message body.'
    - question: 'What are the available GMail scopes that can be specified in the "scopes" option when configuring the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component, and is it mandatory to provide any specific scopes?'
      answer: |
       'The available GMail scopes that can be specified in the "scopes" option when configuring the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component are as follows: "GMail scopes". Providing specific scopes is not mandatory, but if you choose to specify them, they will help control the level of access the application has within your Google account. The group for this option is "consumer".'
    - question: '"What does the ''sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle'' option in the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component do, and why might it be useful to enable or disable this option?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle'' option within the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component is designed to control whether an empty message (no body) should be sent when the polling consumer does not find any files to process during its idle period. This option can be useful in scenarios where you want to maintain a consistent communication flow, even if there are no actual messages to send at a given time. Enabling this option allows your application to notify the recipient about its status, such as being ready for new messages. However, disabling it ensures that only real content is sent, which might be preferred in cases where bandwidth or processing resources are limited and unnecessary messages can negatively impact performance.'
    - question: 'How does the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" function, and when is it beneficial to use it compared to the default exception handling method?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel "google-mail-stream" component allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions (if supported by the third-party component) that occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.              It is beneficial to use this option when it is possible for the third-party component to alert Camel if an exception was thrown, as it provides a more flexible and customizable way of handling exceptions compared to the default exception handling method. When not in use, the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, which logs them at WARN or ERROR level and ignores them. However, some components may handle exceptions internally only, making it impossible to use the bridgeErrorHandler. In such cases, future releases might improve Camel components to hook into the third-party component and make this functionality possible. The "bridgeErrorHandler" option falls under the "consumer (advanced)" group and is optional by default.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "exceptionHandler" option in the Apache Camel google-mail-stream component and when is it not in use if the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled? Also, what happens by default when this option is not provided or set to null, and where can it be found among the consumer options (group)?'
      answer: |
       'The "exceptionHandler" option in the Apache Camel Google-Mail-Stream component allows consumers to utilize a custom ExceptionHandler. However, if the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled, the "exceptionHandler" is not used. By default, when this option is not provided or set to null, exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level will be dealt with by the consumer and ignored. The "exceptionHandler" can be found among the consumer options under the advanced group ("consumer (advanced)") in the configuration settings.'
    - question: 'Given the information provided, here''s a question that could be derived:              "What is the default value and purpose of the ''exchangePattern'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-mail-stream'' and under what group of properties should it typically be found?"              Answer: The default value for the ''exchangePattern'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-mail-stream'' is null. This option sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. It can be found under the ''consumer (advanced)'' group of properties.'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the ''exchangePattern'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-mail-stream'' is null. This option determines the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. It can be found under the ''consumer (advanced)'' group of properties.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component, and can you explain how to customize its behavior using a custom implementation of the `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy` interface?'
      answer: |
       'The `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component is designed to offer a flexible approach to error handling during the poll operation before an Exchange (message) has been created and routed. By default, it does not have a specific value (`defaultValue: null`). You can customize its behavior by providing your own implementation of the `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy` interface. This allows you to control error handling strategies according to your application''s requirements within the consumer group tagged as ''advanced''.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel''s google-mail-stream component, and under which group settings can this option be configured (if it is not required)?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel''s google-mail-stream component is a configurable setting that specifies the number of repeated errors or failed polls before the "backoffMultiplier" should take effect. By default, it does not have a value set. This option can be found under the "scheduler" group settings and is optional, meaning it can be left unconfigured if desired.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream", and is it a required setting in the scheduler group?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" is a configurable setting that determines the number of consecutive idle polls before the backoffMultiplier should be applied. In simpler terms, it''s the number of times a request can be made without receiving a response, after which the system will slow down its polling rate to avoid overloading the server. The default value for this option is null, meaning it doesn''t have a predefined default value and can be set according to specific use-case requirements. It''s worth noting that this setting is not a required one within the "scheduler" group of options, which means you can choose whether or not to include it in your configuration based on your application''s needs.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "backoffMultiplier" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream", and under what conditions should it be used along with "backoffIdleThreshold" and/or "backoffErrorThreshold"? Also, could you explain how this option affects the scheduled polling consumer behavior when idles or errors occur? Furthermore, is there a default value for this option and is its use optional or required? Lastly, in which group of Camel options does "backoffMultiplier" belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffMultiplier" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" serves to allow the scheduled polling consumer to pause or back off when there have been a series of idles or errors. Specifically, this multiplier determines the number of times the polling will be skipped before the next attempt is made again.              When using "backoffMultiplier", it''s essential to configure either the "backoffIdleThreshold" or "backoffErrorThreshold" as well. The former applies when idling occurs, and the latter when errors take place during the scheduled polling process.              In case of repeated idles or errors, the backoffMultiplier causes the consumer to skip a specified number of polls before resuming its activity. This mechanism helps prevent excessive resource usage and minimize potential issues related to high-frequency polling during periods of frequent idling or error conditions.              The default value for "backoffMultiplier" is null, meaning that it''s not automatically assigned any specific value. The use of this option is optional but highly recommended when dealing with situations where idles or errors might be common.              Lastly, the "backoffMultiplier" option belongs to the "scheduler" group of Camel options within the google-mail-stream component.'
    - question: 'How long (in milliseconds) does a poll wait when using the "delay" option of the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component, if it is not explicitly set, and what groups does this option belong to within the scheduler?'
      answer: |
       'The "delay" option in the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component doesn''t have an explicitly set millisecond delay if left unspecified. By default, it waits for 500 milliseconds before the next poll. This option falls under the "scheduler" groups within the configuration settings.'
    - question: 'What does enabling the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" do, and how does it affect the behavior of the ScheduledPollConsumer?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" means that if this setting is activated, the ScheduledPollConsumer will execute again immediately if the previous run polled one or more messages. In other words, it triggers an instantaneous repeat of the consumer process when new emails are detected during the initial polling, thus potentially increasing the rate at which emails are processed from the Google Mail stream.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream", and is it required to be specified when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" is an integer type property, with a default value of 1000 milliseconds (or one second). It''s not a required setting; you can specify it when using this component if desired, as part of the scheduler groups.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "repeatCount" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream", and under which group does it belong if it is not required? Additionally, what happens when the value of this option is set to zero or negative?'
      answer: |
       'The "repeatCount" option within the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" serves as a limit for the number of times an action can be repeated. If you set it to 1, the action will only occur once; if set to 5, it will fire five times. A value of zero or negative means the action will continue indefinitely. This option is not mandatory and falls under the "scheduler" group.'
    - question: 'What is the default logging level for starting and completing polling actions with the Google Mail Stream component in Apache Camel, and how can this logging level be customized if needed?'
      answer: |
       'The default logging level for starting and completing polling actions with the Google Mail Stream component in Apache Camel is TRACE. If you need to customize this logging level, you can do so using the "runLoggingLevel" option. This option allows you to configure the logging level for polling events.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the custom or shared thread pool for the consumer in Apache Camel''s google-mail-stream component using the scheduledExecutorService option? And what is the default value for this configuration option in this component?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom or shared thread pool for the consumer in Apache Camel''s google-mail-stream component, you can use the "scheduledExecutorService" option. This allows you to specify an `Object` representing your thread pool configuration. By default, each consumer has its own single-threaded thread pool, but setting this option enables a custom thread pool. Please note that the default value for this configuration option is null, meaning no custom thread pool is set by default.'
    - question: 'What is the allowed value(s) for the "scheduler" option within the Apache Camel "google-mail-stream" component, and is it necessary to provide a value if its default value is none? Additionally, can the cron scheduler be implemented using either the "camel-spring" or "camel-quartz" components?'
      answer: |
       'The "scheduler" option within the Apache Camel "google-mail-stream" component accepts values of either ''spring'' or ''quartz''. These are built-in schedulers that can be utilized to implement a cron scheduler. However, if you opt not to specify a value, it defaults to none. It is not mandatory to provide a value when the default is set to none. To use the cron scheduler, you can employ either the ''camel-spring'' or ''camel-quartz'' components.'
    - question: 'How can I set custom properties for a scheduler when using the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component (google-mail-stream), and is it mandatory to provide any default values for these properties?'
      answer: |
       'To customize additional properties for a scheduler when utilizing the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component (google-mail-stream), you can configure an object of "schedulerProperties". This allows you to use a custom scheduler or any of the provided Quartz, Spring based schedulers. However, it is not mandatory to provide default values for these properties as they have been defined as null by default.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and requirement status of the "startScheduler" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream"? Does it automatically start, and is it mandatory to set this option?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the "startScheduler" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" is that it is set to true, meaning it will auto-start. However, setting this option is not mandatory as its requirement status is false. This means you can manually control when the scheduler starts if needed.'
    - question: 'What is the default time unit for setting the initialDelay and delay options using the "timeUnit" option in the Apache Camel Google-Mail Stream component, when the time value is not explicitly specified? (Options: MILLISECONDS, SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS)'
      answer: |
       'The default time unit for setting the initialDelay and delay options using the "timeUnit" option in the Apache Camel Google-Mail Stream component is MILLISECONDS, when no explicit time value is specified.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `useFixedDelay` option to false in the Apache Camel google-mail-stream component affect the scheduling behavior, compared to its default value (true), and what is the recommended JDK class for understanding this behavior?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `useFixedDelay` option to false in the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component changes the scheduling behavior from using a fixed delay between messages to using a fixed rate. This means that instead of waiting a specific time after each message is sent, it will send messages at a consistent interval regardless of the processing time for each message.              For understanding this behavior, you may want to refer to the ScheduledExecutorService class in Java''s JDK (Java Development Kit). The `ScheduledExecutorService` allows you to schedule tasks to run after a delay, or to execute periodically, which corresponds to the functioning of the `useFixedDelay` option in the Apache Camel Google Mail Stream component.'
    - question: 'Question: What is the purpose of the "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream", and why is it recommended to use the "refreshToken" instead for long-term usage?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel component "google-mail-stream" is an OAuth 2 access token, used to grant access to Google Mail API services on your behalf. However, it''s important to note that this token typically expires after an hour. To ensure continuous access for long-term usage, it is recommended to use the "refreshToken" instead. This token allows you to automatically obtain a new access token when the current one expires, effectively ensuring uninterrupted service.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it''s required to set the `clientSecret` option in the Apache Camel component `google-mail-stream`, and under what group of options does this setting belong?'
      answer: |
       'The `clientSecret` option in the Apache Camel component `google-mail-stream` is a string type that represents the client secret of your mail application. This value, by default, is not set (defaultValue: null). It''s an optional setting (required: false), meaning you don''t necessarily need to provide it for the component to function. However, this setting falls under the security group of options, indicating its importance in maintaining the security of your mail application.'
    - question: 'How does using the "refreshToken" option in the Apache Camel''s "google-mail-stream" component help in managing access to Google Calendar when the application is long-lived and the current access token has expired? And, is it mandatory to provide a default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'Using the "refreshToken" option in Apache Camel''s "google-mail-stream" component helps manage access to Google Calendar by providing a mechanism to obtain a new access token when the current one expires, which is essential for long-lived applications. This refresh token allows the component to request a fresh access token, thereby ensuring continuous and uninterrupted access to the Google Calendar API. It''s important to note that providing a default value for this option is not mandatory; however, its presence may help handle edge cases or streamline the configuration process, depending on your application''s specific requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel''s "google-mail-stream" component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option? Additionally, what type of data should be provided as its value and where is this file typically located or managed?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceAccountKey" option in Apache Camel''s "google-mail-stream" component is designed to set a .json file containing the credentials for a Service account when using Google Mail. This option is not mandatory, meaning you can choose not to provide a value if you''re not using a Service account or have other authentication methods. If you do decide to provide a value, it should be a string pointing to the path of your .json file. Typically, this file is managed in your project directory, but its exact location may vary depending on your setup and preferences.'
