seed_examples:
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "configurationResource" option in the Apache Camel ignite-queue component, and are there any specific groups (e.g., producer) it applies to?'
      answer: |
       'The "configurationResource" option in the Apache Camel "ignite-queue" component serves the purpose of specifying where the configuration is loaded from. This can be a URL, String, or InputStream type. By default, there is no predefined value for this option ("defaultValue": null). It''s important to note that this option applies only to certain specific groups, specifically the "producer" group within the Camel context.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "ignite" option in the Apache Camel "ignite-queue" component, and is it optional or required when using this component as a producer?'
      answer: |
       'The "ignite" option within the Apache Camel "ignite-queue" component is designed to allow you to use an existing Ignite instance during your processing. It doesn''t have a default value, meaning you need to provide it explicitly if you want to utilize an existing Ignite instance. This option is optional, not required, when using this component as a producer.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "igniteConfiguration" option in the Apache Camel''s "ignite-queue" component, and is it required for both producer and consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The "igniteConfiguration" option in Apache Camel''s "ignite-queue" component allows users to set a programmatic Ignite configuration. This means you can customize the settings of the Ignite cache or grid when using this queue. By default, it does not have a value assigned ("defaultValue": null). It is not a required option; its usage is optional for both producer and consumer. However, if you need to specify unique or additional settings for your Ignite instances, you can use this option accordingly.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Ignite Queue component affect the behavior of the producer, and why might it be beneficial to use this feature?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Ignite Queue component allows for a more flexible and resilient production setup. By configuring the producer to start lazily (on the first message), you can bypass issues that may arise during the starting phase of the component, preventing routes from failing at startup due to producer-related problems.              If a producer might fail during the initial context or route startup, deferring its startup until needed (via lazy startup) enables the failure to be handled during routing messages using Camel''s built-in error handlers. However, be aware that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time, which could prolong the total processing time of the process.              In summary, this feature can provide better recovery from potential startup failures and improve overall system resilience in situations where a producer might otherwise cause issues during the initial CamelContext or route startup.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Ignite-queue component, and can it be disabled if necessary?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Ignite-queue component is a boolean setting that determines whether autowiring is enabled. By default, this option is set to true, which allows for automatic autowiring of options such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, among others. If you wish to disable autowiring, you can set "autowiredEnabled" to false in your configuration. This option is considered advanced and not required for basic usage.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the Apache Camel ignite-queue option named "capacity", and is it required when configuring a producer? Also, what group does this option belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "capacity" option in the Apache Camel "ignite-queue" component is null (non-bounded). It''s of type integer and not required when configuring a producer. This option belongs to the "producer" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "configuration" option in the Apache Camel ignite-queue component, and under what circumstances can it be used to set inner properties?'
      answer: |
       'The "configuration" option in the Apache Camel ignite-queue component serves as a collection for settings that customize its behavior. By default, this configuration is empty. You can utilize this option to set specific inner properties by appending configuration.xyz=123, where xyz represents the property name and 123 stands for the value you want to assign to it. This configuration is primarily used when working with producers in the ignite-queue component.'
    - question: 'What is the possible value for the option named "operation" in the Apache Camel ignite-queue component, and what is its default value if no value is provided?'
      answer: |
       'The possible values for the "operation" option in the Apache Camel "ignite-queue" component include: CONTAINS, ADD, SIZE, REMOVE, ITERATOR, CLEAR, RETAIN_ALL, ARRAY, DRAIN, ELEMENT, PEEK, OFFER, POLL, TAKE, and PUT. The default value for this option is null if no value is provided.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and purpose of the "propagateIncomingBodyIfNoReturnValue" option in the Apache Camel ignite-queue component, and under what circumstances can its value be set to false?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "propagateIncomingBodyIfNoReturnValue" option in the Apache Camel ignite-queue component is to propagate the incoming body if the return type of the underlying Ignite operation is void. This setting determines whether the payload (or body) of the message should be forwarded when the Ignite operation does not have a return value.              In circumstances where you don''t want the incoming body to be propagated in cases where the Ignite operation has no return value, you can set its value to false. This might occur when the downstream processing doesn''t require the message payload after the Ignite operation is executed.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "timeoutMillis" option for the Apache Camel''s "ignite-queue" component, and is it required when configuring a producer? Does it have a specified group?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "timeoutMillis" option in the Apache Camel''s "ignite-queue" component is null (no timeout). It is an integer data type and not required when configuring a producer. Its specified group is "producer".'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and purpose of the "treatCollectionsAsCacheObjects" option in the Apache Camel Ignite-queue component when producing messages, and can it be configured to alter this behavior?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "treatCollectionsAsCacheObjects" option in the Apache Camel Ignite-queue component is set to false, meaning that Collections are treated as collections of items to insert/update/compute rather than as cache objects when producing messages. However, this behavior can be configured by setting it to true if you wish to treat Collections as cache objects instead.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel component "ignite-queue" option named "lazyStartProducer", and what are the potential impacts on the processing time when this option is set to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "ignite-queue" component''s "lazyStartProducer" option in Apache Camel allows you to defer the startup of the producer until the first message arrives. This can be beneficial in scenarios where the producer might fail during the initial context or route startup, preventing the entire process from being initiated.              When this option is set to true, the CamelContext and routes will start without issue, and the producer creation and startup will be delayed until the first message is processed. While this can help manage startup failures, it''s important to note that creating and starting the producer upon processing the first message may take additional time, which could potentially prolong the total processing time of your application.              In summary, using "lazyStartProducer" gives you control over when the producer is started, improving the overall startup resilience, but with potential implications on the first-message processing time.'
