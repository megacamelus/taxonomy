    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "binaryPayload" option in the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager", and is it required to be specified when using this component as a producer?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "binaryPayload" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component is false. It belongs to the boolean data type, and it''s not mandatory to specify this option when utilizing this component as a producer, although it determines whether the secret is binary or not.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the "configuration" option in the "aws-secrets-manager" component under Apache Camel when not required, as stated by its group belonging to the "producer"?'
      answer: |
       'The "configuration" option within the "aws-secrets-manager" component in Apache Camel is intended for providing configuration details, which can be used when working with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Secrets Manager. However, this option does not have a default value specified, allowing developers to provide their own configuration based on their specific use cases. Despite not being required, it falls under the "producer" group, indicating its relevance to producing data from Camel routes interacting with AWS services.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component affect the behavior of a route during startup, and what are potential considerations when using this feature?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component allows for a more resilient route startup by deferring the creation and initialization of the producer until the first message is processed. This can be useful when the initializing of the producer might otherwise cause the route to fail during starting, as error handlers can manage any potential issues. However, be aware that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time. This consideration should be weighed against the benefit of ensuring successful startup in potentially problematic scenarios.'
    - question: 'What is the default operation that can be performed when using the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component? Is it mandatory to specify an operation for this component? If not, what are the possible operations that can be performed with the AWS Secrets Manager component in Apache Camel?'
      answer: |
       'The default operation that can be performed when using the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component is not specified as it''s an optional field (defaultValue: null). However, when working with this component, you may choose from various operations such as GetSecretValue (to retrieve the actual secret value), DescribeSecret (to get metadata and version information of a secret), ListSecrets (to list all available secrets in your account), and others, depending on your specific use case within the producer groups.'
    - question: 'How does one set the Apache Camel `aws-secrets-manager` component to override the endpoint using the `overrideEndpoint` boolean option, and what is the default value when this option is not provided?'
      answer: |
       'To set the AWS Secrets Manager component in Apache Camel to override the endpoint using the `overrideEndpoint` boolean option, you need to specify it as a property within your route configuration. When this option is used, combine it with the `uriEndpointOverride` option that provides the custom endpoint URL. If the `overrideEndpoint` value is not provided, its default value will be false. Here''s an example:              ```       from("aws-secrets-manager:my-resource?uriEndpointOverride=custom.endpoint&overrideEndpoint=true")           // Your route logic here       ```'
    - question: 'How does one configure an AWS Secrets Manager component in Apache Camel to send a POJO request as the body of the message, if this feature is optional?'
      answer: |
       'To configure an AWS Secrets Manager component in Apache Camel to send a POJO request as the body of the message, you can set the "pojoRequest" option to true for that specific component. However, note that this option is marked as ''optional'', so you can still use it even if left at its default value (false). To do so, you would modify your Camel route similar to the following:              ```java       from("aws-secrets-manager")           .setBody(simple("{\"pojoRequest\":true,\"yourPOJOInstance\"}")) // Include this line only if you want to use a POJO request           ... // rest of your route       ```              Make sure to replace `"yourPOJOInstance"` with an instance of the Java Pojo class that matches your use case. If you decide not to send a POJO request as the body, simply omit this line in your route configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the expected format and usage for the "region" option when configuring the Apache Camel aws-secrets-manager component, if a specific region for Secrets Manager client operation is to be specified (when not using the default value)? Also, what is the correct Java method call to retrieve the string identifier for Region.EU_WEST_1?'
      answer: |
       'To specify a custom region when configuring the Apache Camel `aws-secrets-manager` component, use the "region" option with a lowercase string representing the region name, such as "ap-east-1". When working in Java, you can retrieve the string identifier for Region.EU_WEST_1 using the AWS SDK method call: `Region.EU_WEST_1.id()`.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of using the "uriEndpointOverride" option when working with the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component, and under what conditions should it be used in conjunction with the "overrideEndpoint" option? Additionally, can you specify whether this option has a default value and if it is mandatory to provide a value for it?'
      answer: |
       'When working with the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component, the "uriEndpointOverride" option serves to set an overriding URI endpoint. This option should be used in combination with the "overrideEndpoint" option. The purpose of this pairing is to bypass the standard endpoint URL and explicitly specify a different one for your AWS Secrets Manager connection. It''s important to note that providing a value for "uriEndpointOverride" is not mandatory, as indicated by its default value being null. This option falls under the producer group of settings.'
    - question: '"What is the purpose and default value of the ''useProfileCredentialsProvider'' option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component, and is its use optional or required?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''useProfileCredentialsProvider'' option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component is designed to control whether the Secrets Manager client should be able to load credentials through a profile credentials provider. Its default value is false, meaning by default, it does not expect to load credentials via a profile credentials provider. Using this option is optional rather than required within the producer groups.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and optional nature of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager", and under what conditions is it used for automatic configuration of various resources such as AWS clients or data sources?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in the AWS Secrets Manager component of Apache Camel has a default value of true, which means that autowiring is enabled by default. This feature allows for automatic configuration of resources like AWS clients, JDBC data sources, or JMS connection factories by searching the registry for a single instance of matching type. If an appropriate instance is found, it gets configured on the component without requiring explicit setup. This option is part of the advanced group, meaning it''s not strictly necessary for basic usage but can be useful in situations where automatic configuration simplifies setup and management.'
    - question: 'How do I set up or provide an existing AWS Secrets Manager client for use with the Apache Camel aws-secrets-manager component, if I don''t wish to use the default value and instead want to configure one myself?'
      answer: |
       'To set up an existing AWS Secrets Manager client for use with the Apache Camel `aws-secrets-manager` component without using the default value, you can configure it by providing an "options" object when setting up the component. Specifically, you will want to include a "secretsManagerClient" property within this options object, which should contain your already configured AWS Secrets Manager client.              Here is an example of how you might set this up in your Apache Camel configuration:              ```xml       <bean id="awsSecretsManagerClient" class="com.amazonaws.services.secretsmanager.AWSSecretManager">           <!-- Configure your AWS Secrets Manager client here -->       </bean>              <camelContext id="myCamelContext">           <route id="mySecretRoute">               <from uri="direct:getMySecret" />               <bean ref="awsSecretsManagerClient" method="getSecret" bodyMethod="literal">                   <arg value="${mySecretArn}" />               </bean>               <!-- Remaining route processing -->           </route>           <component id="awsComponent" uri="aws-secrets-manager">               <property name="options" value="{ ''secretsManagerClient'': ''#{ awsSecretsManagerClient } }"/>           </component>       </camelContext>       ```'
    - question: 'How is the default behavior of the "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component regarding enabling or disabling health checks from consumers, and can its configuration be considered optional?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component is that it allows all consumer-based health checks from this component. This setting can be configured but its use is not mandatory. In other words, you can choose to enable or disable these health checks as per your application''s requirements within the "health" group of settings.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component to disable or enable producer based health checks? And what is the default value for the option ''healthCheckProducerEnabled'' in this component?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component regarding producer-based health checks, you can set the ''healthCheckProducerEnabled'' option. By default, this option is already enabled with a value of true. If you wish to disable these health checks, you should set it to false in your configuration. Please remember that by default, Camel has disabled all producer-based health checks. You can turn on producer checks globally by setting ''camel.health.producersEnabled=true''.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "proxyHost" option within the Apache Camel''s "aws-secrets-manager" component, and is it required or optional to provide a value for this parameter when instantiating the Secrets Manager client?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyHost" option within the AWS Secrets Manager component in Apache Camel is an optional setting used to define a proxy host when initializing the Secrets Manager client. There is no default value specified for this parameter, meaning you can choose whether or not to provide one depending on your specific setup and requirements regarding proxies.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "proxyPort" option when configuring an instance of the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component, and is its usage associated with setting up a proxy for the Secrets Manager client?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyPort" option in the context of configuring an instance of the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component serves to define a custom proxy port when instantiating the Secrets Manager client. This is useful if you need to set up a proxy for the Secrets Manager client during communication. By default, the "proxyPort" value can be left unset or null. The group associated with this option is "proxy", indicating it pertains to such configurations.'
    - question: 'How is the proxy protocol defined when creating an instance of the AWS Secrets Manager client using Apache Camel''s aws-secrets-manager component, and what are the available options for this definition apart from HTTPS (the default)?'
      answer: |
       'In response to your question, the proxy protocol can be defined when creating an instance of the AWS Secrets Manager client using Apache Camel''s aws-secrets-manager component by specifying the "proxyProtocol" option within the object. The available options for this definition apart from HTTPS (the default) are not explicitly stated in your provided information, but they could potentially include SSH or SOCKS if supported by AWS Secrets Manager and Apache Camel. However, it''s always best to refer to the official documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date details on available options and their specific configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, required status, and group of the option "accessKey" in the Apache Camel component ''aws-secrets-manager'' and what kind of AWS credential does it represent?'
      answer: |
       'The option "accessKey" within the Apache Camel component ''aws-secrets-manager'' represents an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Access Key. This key is used for security purposes to grant access to AWS services, such as Amazon S3 or Amazon EC2. Its default value is null, meaning it requires user provisioning before use. The data type of the option is a string. It is optional, so its inclusion during configuration setup is not mandatory. Lastly, this option falls under the security group within the AWS Secrets Manager component.'
    - question: 'How is the `secretKey` option used in the Apache Camel component `aws-secrets-manager`, and is it required or optional? Also, what is its data type, and does it have a default value?'
      answer: |
       'The `secretKey` option within the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component is an optional string (type: "string") that represents an Amazon AWS Secret Key. It provides access to secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager. If no value is provided for this option, it defaults to null. However, its use and whether to provide a value depends on the specific configuration of your application, falling under the "security" groups due to the sensitive nature of secret keys.'
    - question: 'How is a custom Amazon AWS Session Token specified using the "aws-secrets-manager" component in Apache Camel, and is it required for usage? Also, can you explain the purpose of this option within the context of security in the system?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the Apache Camel''s aws-secrets-manager component, a custom Amazon AWS Session Token is not specified by default as it is an optional parameter denoted by `"required": false`. If you need to use an AWS Session Token when assuming an IAM role, you can provide this token in your configuration.              The purpose of the "sessionToken" option within the context of security lies in securing access to AWS resources when using temporary credentials such as a Session Token. This is crucial when you have temporary or long-lived IAM roles that require granting permissions beyond those of the originating user. By utilizing Session Tokens, you enhance your system''s security by allowing fine-grained control over the permissions and actions each user can perform, even within an assumed IAM role.'
    - question: '"What is the purpose and default value of the ''trustAllCertificates'' option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component, and is it required for use?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''trustAllCertificates'' option within the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component is designed to handle certificate trust when the endpoint is overridden. If you set this option to true, it will automatically trust all certificates presented by the Secrets Manager service. However, by default, the value of ''trustAllCertificates'' is false, meaning that only trusted certificates are accepted. This setting is optional and falls under the security group within the configuration options for AWS Secrets Manager.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component and what is its default value, as well as whether it is required for use?'
      answer: |
       'The "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component determines whether the client should automatically load credentials or receive static credentials during runtime. It''s a boolean parameter with a default value of false, meaning that by default, the component does not use auto-loaded credentials. However, it is worth noting that this option is optional and can be configured according to your specific security requirements under the "security" group in the configuration.'
    - question: 'How does the option "useSessionCredentials" within the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component affect the behavior of the Secrets Manager client, and what is its default value and type?'
      answer: |
       'The "useSessionCredentials" option within the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component determines whether the Secrets Manager client should expect to use IAM Session Credentials during operations. This setting becomes crucial when a user needs to assume an IAM role for performing tasks in Secrets Manager. By default, this option is set to false. The "useSessionCredentials" parameter is of type boolean and it''s optional, falling under the ''security'' group of settings.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `binaryPayload` option to `true` when using the `aws-secrets-manager` component in Apache Camel affect data transfer, and is it required for proper operation if its default value is false?'
      answer: |
       'When you set the `binaryPayload` option to `true` for the `aws-secrets-manager` component in Apache Camel, it specifies that the secret being accessed is a binary file instead of text data. This can impact data transfer by ensuring that the binary content of the secret is transferred correctly without any unwanted encoding or decoding during transport. While setting `binaryPayload` to true is not a required step for proper operation if its default value is false, it''s good practice when working with binary secrets such as private keys, certificates, and similar files, to guarantee accurate data handling within the Camel pipeline.'
    - question: 'What is the default operation performed when using the ''operation'' option for the Apache Camel component ''aws-secrets-manager''? Since the default value is not provided, it can be inferred that there might not be a specific predefined default operation; users may need to specify the operation according to their requirements.'
      answer: |
       'There isn''t a default operation defined for the ''operation'' option when using the Apache Camel component ''aws-secrets-manager''. Users should specify an operation according to their requirements as no predefined operation is performed by default.'
    - question: 'How should you utilize the `overrideEndpoint` option within the `aws-secrets-manager` component of Apache Camel, when considering its requirement for combination with the `uriEndpointOverride` option and understanding its default value is false?'
      answer: |
       'To utilize the `overrideEndpoint` option in the `aws-secrets-manager` component within Apache Camel, you should be aware that it requires combination with the `uriEndpointOverride` option. The `overrideEndpoint` option determines whether or not to override the endpoint provided by AWS Secrets Manager; its default value is `false`. When you find a scenario where you wish to manually specify an alternate endpoint for your Secrets Manager call, set `overrideEndpoint` to `true`, and simultaneously provide an adjusted endpoint in the `uriEndpointOverride` option. This group of settings falls under "producer" category.'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager" handle using a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) as the request body when making AWS Secrets Manager requests with the option "pojoRequest"? Does it have a default value and is its use optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager" allows you to decide whether to use a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) as the body for your AWS Secrets Manager requests through the option named "pojoRequest". By default, this feature is not enabled ("defaultValue": false). Its use is optional, not required within the context of the producer groups.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of setting the `profileCredentialsName` option in the Apache Camel component `aws-secrets-manager`, and can it be left empty or null if I am not using a specific profile credentials provider?'
      answer: |
       'The `profileCredentialsName` option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component is intended to set a profile name when you''re using a profile credentials provider. If you are not utilizing a specific profile credentials provider, this parameter can be left empty or null, as it is an optional setting within the producer group.'
    - question: 'What is the expected format and purpose of the "region" option in the Apache Camel aws-secrets-manager component, and how should it be specified when not using a default value? In this context, what does "You''ll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id()" mean in terms of string formatting for the region option?'
      answer: |
       'The "region" option in the Apache Camel aws-secrets-manager component specifies the AWS region where the Secrets Manager client should operate. When using this parameter, it''s essential to provide the lowercase name of the region (for example, ap-east-1). Regarding the string formatting for the region option, when not using a default value, you need to use the name in the format Region.EU_WEST_1.id(). In this context, "Region.EU_West_1.id()" is a Camel expression that represents a specific AWS resource identifier (Resource Endpoint URI) for the given region, which can be used as a configuration value when needed.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "uriEndpointOverride" option in the Apache Camel "aws-secrets-manager" component, and under what conditions should it be used in combination with the "overrideEndpoint" option? Is it mandatory or optional to specify a value for the "uriEndpointOverride"?'
      answer: |
       'The "uriEndpointOverride" option in the Apache Camel "aws-secrets-manager" component is designed to allow you to explicitly set an override for the URI endpoint. This option should be used in conjunction with the "overrideEndpoint" option when you need to customize the URI endpoint, deviating from the default provided by AWS Secrets Manager. It''s essential to note that using "uriEndpointOverride" is optional as it provides a means of customization rather than a requirement.'
    - question: 'In the context of using the Apache Camel''s AWS Secret Manager component, can you explain the purpose and implications when setting the `useProfileCredentialsProvider` option to true or false during the production phase? Furthermore, what is the default value of this option and is it necessary for its configuration?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s AWS Secrets Manager component during production, the "useProfileCredentialsProvider" option determines whether the Secrets Manager client should load credentials using a profile credentials provider. Setting this option to true allows the client to do so, which can be useful if you have your AWS credentials configured in an AWS CLI profile (e.g., for added security or convenience). Conversely, setting it to false bypasses this method and uses the hardcoded access keys instead. The default value of this option is false, meaning that the Secrets Manager client will not expect to load credentials through a profile credentials provider by default. While it is not required, configuring this option can influence how your AWS credentials are managed during the production phase.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component affect the starting and handling of producer failures, and what impact does it have on the total processing time?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component allows for a more flexible startup of your components by deferring the production of secrets until the first message is processed. This can help prevent route failures due to producer startups that may otherwise fail during initialization.              In situations where a producer might ordinarily fail during startup and cause the route failure, enabling lazy startup enables you to handle these failures using Camel''s error handlers during the routing of messages instead. However, it is essential to be aware that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some additional time, which will increase the total processing time compared to non-lazy startup scenarios. This can help prevent route failures due to producer startups that may otherwise fail during initialization. This option falls under the "producer (advanced)" group in Apache Camel, indicating it is an advanced configuration for fine-tuning your component''s behavior.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the "secretsManagerClient" option in the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager" to use an existing configured AWS Secrets Manager client, if not providing a default value?'
      answer: |
       'To use an existing configured AWS Secrets Manager client with the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager", you should set the "secretsManagerClient" option to an instance of the AWS SDK''s SecretsManagerClient class that you have already configured. Since the default value is null, you don''t need to specify it when configuring your route. This can be done by directly providing the client object within the configuration of your Camel component:              ```java       awsComponent.setSecretsManagerClient(yourConfiguredAWS secrectsManagerClient);       ```              This way, you can leverage an already configured AWS Secrets Manager client when using the "aws-secrets-manager" component in Apache Camel, avoiding the need to reconfigure it each time. Keep in mind that this configuration option is marked as advanced and is only applicable for users who have previously configured their AWS clients.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''proxyHost'' option in the Apache Camel component named ''aws-secrets-manager'', and is it required to be set? Additionally, which group does this option belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The ''proxyHost'' option in the Apache Camel component called ''aws-secrets-manager'' serves to define a proxy host when creating the Secrets Manager client. It is an optional setting, with no default value (indicated by null in the data provided). This configuration element falls under the "proxy" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "proxyPort" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component, and is it required for instantiation? Also, to which configuration group does it belong?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyPort" option in the AWS Secrets Manager component of Apache Camel is an optional integer parameter that allows you to define a proxy port when instantiating the Secrets Manager client. This option is not required for the instantiation, and it belongs to the configuration group named "proxy". The default value for this option is not specified (null).'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "proxyProtocol" option in the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager", and what are its possible values and whether it''s a required setting when instantiating the Secrets Manager client?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyProtocol" option in the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager" is an optional setting that allows you to define a proxy protocol when initializing the Secrets Manager client. The possible values for this option are HTTP (or its secure counterpart HTTPS, which is the default value). This configuration enables communication through a proxy server if required, enhancing flexibility in networking scenarios where a proxy might be necessary for accessing resources.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value (if any), data type, and required status of the ''accessKey'' option within the Apache Camel ''aws-secrets-manager'' component in terms of its description as an Amazon AWS Access Key? Also, where does this option belong in the group hierarchy within the Camel components?'
      answer: |
       'The ''accessKey'' option within the Apache Camel ''aws-secrets-manager'' component is described as an Amazon AWS Access Key. It does not have a default value (defaultValue: null). The data type of this option is a string (type: string), and it is marked as optional, meaning that it is not always required (required: false). In terms of its group hierarchy within the Camel components, it falls under the ''security'' group (groups: "security").'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and required status of the option "secretKey" in the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager"? Also, where does this option belong within the list of component groups or options?'
      answer: |
       'The option "secretKey" in the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager" is designed to hold an Amazon AWS Secret Key. It doesn''t have a default value (defaultValue: null). The data type for this option is a string ("type":"string"). This option is not mandatory to provide, as it''s optional ("required": false). Moreover, this option falls under the "security" group of options ("groups":"security"), indicating its role in handling sensitive data.'
    - question: 'How is a session token, used for assuming an IAM role in Amazon Web Services (AWS) when utilizing the Apache Camel `aws-secrets-manager` component, configured within the component options if it''s not required but provided for better security? And what is the default value of this option if it''s not provided?'
      answer: |
       'When using the Apache Camel `aws-secrets-manager` component in AWS, the session token (option) can be configured to enhance security when assuming an IAM role. Although it''s not required, providing a session token as part of the component options will improve the overall security posture. The default value for this option is null if not explicitly provided in the configuration. You would specify the session token in your configuration accordingly, like so: `{"sessionToken":"YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN"}` when you want to use it.'
    - question: '"In the context of using Apache Camel''s aws-secrets-manager component, what does the ''trustAllCertificates'' option do when it is set to true and what is its default value?"'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using Apache Camel''s aws-secrets-manager component, setting the ''trustAllCertificates'' option to true means that all certificates, regardless of their validity, will be trusted during endpoint communication with AWS Secrets Manager. This can be useful when manually overriding the endpoint, but it is important to note that it compromises security as it ignores the SSL/TLS certificate validation. By default, this option is set to false, meaning only validated certificates are accepted for communication with AWS Secrets Manager.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" option within the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager", and can it be required or omitted?'
      answer: |
       'The "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" option in the AWS Secrets Manager component for Apache Camel determines whether the client should load credentials through a default provider (like IAM roles) or expect static credentials to be passed directly. Its default value is false, meaning it doesn''t use the default credentials provider by default. While this parameter is not required, you can choose to specify or omit it according to your use case in terms of handling AWS Secret Manager credential loading. This setting falls under the security group due to its relationship with managing and safeguarding sensitive information.'
    - question: 'Can you explain when it would be beneficial to set the "useSessionCredentials" option to true when using the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component, and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'When working with the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component, setting the "useSessionCredentials" option to true can be advantageous in scenarios where you need to assume an IAM role for conducting operations within Secrets Manager. This is particularly useful when the user''s regular credentials lack sufficient permissions for the intended actions. The default value for this option is false, meaning that if no explicit setting is made, the component will not use Session Credentials.'
