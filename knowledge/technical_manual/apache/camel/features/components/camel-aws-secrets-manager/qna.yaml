    - question: 'How does setting the `binaryPayload` option to `true` in an Apache Camel route using the AWS Secrets Manager component affect the handling of secrets when producing messages? And, what is the default value for this option and is it required to be set in a route configuration?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `binaryPayload` option to `true` in an Apache Camel route using the AWS Secrets Manager component indicates that the secret being retrieved is binary data, not text. This allows you to handle secrets like files or certificates directly within your route configuration. The default value for this option is `false`, meaning it assumes the secret is text by default. However, if you''re dealing with binary secrets, it''s recommended to explicitly set `binaryPayload` to `true` in your route configuration for correct handling.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and requirement (present or optional) for the "configuration" option in the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager" when used as a producer?'
      answer: |
       'The "configuration" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component ("aws-secrets-manager") does not have a default value and is optional when used as a producer, meaning you''re not required to provide it.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component affect the startup behavior and potential performance of a route?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component allows for a more flexible startup behavior for your routes, especially when dealing with producers that might otherwise fail during initializing, causing the route to fail as well. By setting this option to true, the producer will not start immediately but rather be initiated on the first message. This approach offers an opportunity to manage startup failures through Camel''s error handling mechanisms during routing messages.              However, it is essential to consider that when the initial message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time compared to an immediate initialization, potentially prolonging total processing times for the route since a brief delay will occur before the producer becomes active.'
    - question: 'What is the required operation when using the ''aws-secrets-manager'' component in Apache Camel, specifically within the producer context, and does it have a default value?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the ''aws-secrets-manager'' component within the "producer" group in Apache Camel, the required operation is not specified by default. You must provide an operation explicitly when configuring this component to interact with AWS Secrets Manager. There is no default value for the operation.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the Apache Camel aws-secrets-manager component to override the endpoint when using the producer, and what is the default value for this option if it''s not specified?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the AWS Secrets Manager component in Apache Camel to override the endpoint when using the producer, you should set the "overrideEndpoint" option to true. This option works in combination with the "uriEndpointOverride" option. If this option is not specified, its default value is false. This configuration falls under the "producer" group.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and optional nature of using a POJO request as the body when employing the AWS Secrets Manager component in Apache Camel, according to its configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior when employing the AWS Secrets Manager component in Apache Camel is that a POJO request will not be used as the body (defaultValue: false). This setting is optional (required: false), meaning you can choose whether or not to use a POJO request as the body, based on your specific requirements. This configuration option falls under the "producer" group of settings in AWS Secrets Manager.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "profileCredentialsName" option in the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager", and is it required when using this component? Also, can you explain what a profile credentials provider is and how to set the profile name when using it with the aws-secrets-manager component?'
      answer: |
       'The "profileCredentialsName" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component allows you to specify a profile name if you''re using a profile credentials provider. This parameter is not required, meaning you can also use the component without explicitly setting it. A profile credentials provider helps manage AWS credentials, allowing you to switch between different sets of credentials for various uses. To set the profile name when using the aws-secrets-manager component with a profile credentials provider, you should provide the desired profile name as a string in the "profileCredentialsName" option. For instance, if you have profiles named "dev", "stage", and "prod", you can set the profile name as "dev" for development work, "stage" for testing on staging environments, or "prod" for production usage.'
    - question: 'What is the expected format for specifying the AWS region when using the "region" option in the Apache Camel aws-secrets-manager component, and how can you set it if a default value is not provided? (Hint: Use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() instead of hardcoding the region string.)'
      answer: |
       'To specify the AWS region when using the "region" option in the Apache Camel aws-secrets-manager component, you should use the format provided as a hint: `Region.EU_WEST_1.id()`. This is case sensitive and expects the lowercase name of the region (e.g., ap-east-1 becomes `ap-east-1.id()`).              If no default value is provided, you will need to manually set this parameter according to your desired AWS region in the configuration or code where you are using the aws-secrets-manager component.'
    - question: 'How should you use the "uriEndpointOverride" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component if you want to override the default URI endpoint, and what type of value does this option accept?'
      answer: |
       'To utilize the "uriEndpointOverride" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component, you should set it in combination with the "overrideEndpoint" option. This allows you to override the default URI endpoint. The "uriEndpointOverride" option accepts a string value. It''s important to note that this option is optional and its use falls under the "producer" group of settings.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `useProfileCredentialsProvider` option to true in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component affect the behavior of loading credentials for the Secrets Manager client?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `useProfileCredentialsProvider` option to true in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component allows the Secrets Manager client to load credentials through a profile credentials provider instead of hardcoding them directly. This means that the credentials will be fetched from an AWS credential file (often located at `~/.aws/credentials`) based on the specified profile, providing a more secure and manageable way to handle sensitive information like access keys and secrets.'
    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager" impact the automatic configuration of AWS clients within this component, and what is the default setting for this option?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the AWS Secrets Manager component for Apache Camel allows for automatic configuration of AWS clients within this component. This is achieved by using autowiring, which looks up in the registry to find a single instance of matching type, and then configures that instance on the component. If you choose not to enable this option (by setting it to false), manual configuration of these AWS clients will be required. The default value for the "autowiredEnabled" option is true.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel aws-secrets-manager component to utilize an existing AWS Secrets Manager client instance, instead of creating a new one by default?'
      answer: |
       'To utilize an existing AWS Secrets Manager client instance with the Apache Camel `aws-secrets-manager` component, you can configure it using the `secretsManagerClient` option. This allows your code to reference the already configured client instead of creating a new one by default. Here''s how you can set it up:              In your Apache Camel configuration, ensure that you have an instance of `AWS Secrets Manager Client`. Once that is in place, you can pass this client as an option when configuring the `aws-secrets-manager` component like so:              ```java       MyExistingSecretsManagerClient myClient = ... ; // your existing AWS Secrets Manager client instance              from("direct:getSecret")           .component(aws-secrets-manager)           .option(AwsComponentOptions.SECRET_MANAGER_CLIENT, myClient);       ```              By doing this, you are instructing the `aws-secrets-manager` component to use your existing client when performing operations against AWS Secrets Manager. Keep in mind that this option is under the "advanced" group, so it may not be required for basic usage scenarios.'
    - question: 'Can you explain the purpose and default behavior of the ''healthCheckConsumerEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component, and provide an example scenario where setting it to false might be beneficial?'
      answer: |
       'The ''healthCheckConsumerEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component is used to control whether all consumer-based health checks are enabled or disabled from this specific component. By default, it is set to true, meaning that health checks are active.              Setting ''healthCheckConsumerEnabled'' to false may be beneficial when you want to disable health checks for the component temporarily or permanently, depending on your use case. For instance, in a situation where you''re performing maintenance tasks on the AWS Secrets Manager and do not want Camel to evaluate its health during this period, you could set this option to false to prevent any health check failures from impacting your overall system. However, it is essential to remember that disabling health checks might affect the reliability and resilience of your system by making it harder to detect potential issues.'
    - question: 'How does the healthCheckProducerEnabled option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component affect the behavior of producer-based health checks, and what is its default value, if not explicitly set?'
      answer: |
       'The "healthCheckProducerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component determines whether producer-based health checks are enabled or disabled for that component. By default, Camel has disabled all producer-based health checks. However, you can enable them globally by setting the value of "camel.health.producersEnabled" to true. If this option is not explicitly set in your configuration, it will default to being enabled (true).'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "proxyHost" option in the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager", and is it required or optional? Also, can you provide an example of how to use this option when instantiating the Secrets Manager client?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyHost" option in the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager" allows you to define a proxy host when initializing the Secrets Manager client. This option is optional, meaning it can be left unspecified if no proxy is needed. To use this option when instantiating the Secrets Manager client, you would provide a string value for the "proxyHost". Here''s an example of how to use this option:              ```java       SecretsManagerClient secretsManager = AWSClientBuilder.factory()           .withProxyHost("your_proxy_host") // specify if using a proxy           .build()           .withRegion(Regions.US_EAST_1)           .create();       ```'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''proxyPort'' option in the Apache Camel component ''aws-secrets-manager'', and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option? Additionally, can you specify the group or category this option belongs to?'
      answer: |
       'The ''proxyPort'' option in the Apache Camel component ''aws-secrets-manager'' is designed to allow you to define a proxy port when instantiating the Secrets Manager client. However, it does not have a default value (defaultValue: null). This option is optional, meaning it is not mandatory to provide a value for this option. The group or category this option belongs to is ''proxy''.'
    - question: 'How is the ''proxyProtocol'' option set within an Apache Camel route using the AWS Secrets Manager component, and what are the possible values that can be assigned to it?'
      answer: |
       'In an Apache Camel route, you can set the ''proxyProtocol'' option within the AWS Secrets Manager component by defining it as a property and retrieving its value from the Secrets Manager using the appropriate Camel Excel function. Here''s a simplified example:              ```       from("direct:start")           .setProperty("proxyProtocol", simple("${aws-secrets-manager:my-secret}")).to("direct:next");              // ... other components in the route              from("direct:next")           // Other components that use the ''proxyProtocol'' property       ```              In this example, replace "my-secret" with the name of your secret in AWS Secrets Manager. The possible values for the ''proxyProtocol'' option are HTTP and HTTPS. By default, HTTPS is used if not explicitly set.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and requirement status of the ''accessKey'' option in the Apache Camel component ''aws-secrets-manager'', and to which group does it belong in terms of its function?'
      answer: |
       'The ''accessKey'' option within the Apache Camel component ''aws-secrets-manager'' serves as a placeholder for an Amazon AWS Access Key. Its default value is null, indicating that it may or may not be provided. The data type of this option is string. Regarding its requirement status, using ''accessKey'' is optional, but its inclusion is recommended for proper interaction with AWS services. In terms of its function, the ''accessKey'' option belongs to the ''security'' group due to its role in handling sensitive AWS credentials.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it''s required to use the ''secretKey'' option in the ''aws-secrets-manager'' component of Apache Camel when dealing with security-related operations?'
      answer: |
       'The ''secretKey'' option in the ''aws-secrets-manager'' component of Apache Camel is a string data type that represents an Amazon AWS Secret Key. This option is used for security-related operations, but its use is optional as indicated by the "required: false". By default, it has no preset value (''defaultValue'': null). When using this option, you can provide your own secret key to access and manage secrets in AWS Secrets Manager as needed.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "sessionToken" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component and is it required for use? Also, what data type should this option accept if provided, and where does the default value lie?'
      answer: |
       'The "sessionToken" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component is used to provide an Amazon AWS Session Token when the user needs to assume an IAM role. This token is optional for use, as certain scenarios may not require it depending on your AWS configuration. If provided, the "sessionToken" should be of type string. By default, this option has no preset value. The group where this option belongs is security.'
    - question: '"In the context of using the Apache Camel aws-secrets-manager component, what is the purpose of setting the option ''trustAllCertificates'' to true and what is its default value?"'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the Apache Camel `aws-secrets-manager` component, setting the option ''trustAllCertificates'' to true means that you are overriding the certificate verification process, effectively trusting all certificates presented by the AWS Secrets Manager service. This can be useful in certain circumstances where you wish to bypass normal certificate validation. However, it is important to note that this should only be done with caution, as it weakens security by accepting any certificate without verification. The default value for ''trustAllCertificates'' is false, meaning normal certificate validation is used. This setting falls under the ''security'' group of options in the component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" option within the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager", and are there any specific circumstances where it might not be required to use this feature?'
      answer: |
       'The "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component determines whether the client will automatically load credentials or expect static credentials to be provided. By default, it is set to false, meaning that no automatic credential loading occurs. This feature may not be required if you prefer to explicitly pass your own credentials for security purposes or when working with accounts where default credentials are not accessible or desirable.'
    - question: 'How does setting the "useSessionCredentials" option to true in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component affect the behavior of the client, and when would it be beneficial to do so compared to its default value?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "useSessionCredentials" option to true in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component allows the Secrets Manager client to expect using Session Credentials for operations. This is particularly useful when the user needs to assume an IAM role for accessing Secrets Manager, as it enables seamless authentication and authorization based on the assumed role. Compared to its default value (false), enabling this option can be beneficial in scenarios where you want to leverage temporary security credentials associated with an IAM role, rather than using long-term access keys or assuming a fixed identity for Secrets Manager operations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the boolean option "binaryPayload" in the Apache Camel component aws-secrets-manager, and is it a required configuration? (Hint: The option affects whether the secret is treated as binary or not, and it has a default value of false, and it''s not a required configuration.)'
      answer: |
       'In response to your question, the boolean option "binaryPayload" in the Apache Camel component aws-secrets-manager determines whether the secret is treated as binary or not. Its default value is set to false. This option is not mandatory for configuration, meaning you can choose whether to provide it when working with AWS Secrets Manager components.'
    - question: 'What is the required operation that can be performed when using the AWS Secrets Manager component in Apache Camel''s producer configuration, and is it mandatory to set a default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The operation that can be performed when utilizing the AWS Secrets Manager component within Apache Camel''s producer configuration is a required setting. However, it is not mandatory to provide a default value for this option.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel component ''aws-secrets-manager'' such that I can override the endpoint, and what is the purpose of using the ''overrideEndpoint'' option in combination with the ''uriEndpointOverride'' option? Is it necessary to set the default value for ''overrideEndpoint'' when using this configuration?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel component `aws-secrets-manager` to override the endpoint, you can use the options `overrideEndpoint` and `uriEndpointOverride`. The `overrideEndpoint` option is set to a boolean value (default: false) and determines whether or not you need to override the endpoint. This should be used in conjunction with the `uriEndpointOverride` option, which allows you to specify a custom endpoint URL when needed. It''s important to note that setting the `overrideEndpoint` to true is necessary only if you want to provide a custom endpoint URL via the `uriEndpointOverride`. If you don''t need to override the endpoint, there''s no requirement to set the default value for `overrideEndpoint`.'
    - question: '"In the Apache Camel component ''aws-secrets-manager'', what is the default value and possible usage of the ''pojoRequest'' option, and is its use optional?"'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component, the ''pojoRequest'' option determines whether a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) should be used as the request body. By default, this option is set to false, meaning a non-POJO format will be used. However, setting it to true allows you to send a POJO as the request body. The use of ''pojoRequest'' is optional, and its group is designated as "producer", indicating it''s primarily relevant when you''re producing messages in your Camel routes.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "profileCredentialsName" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "profileCredentialsName" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component is an optional string parameter that allows you to set a profile name if you''re using a profile credentials provider. If this parameter is not provided, it has no default value. It falls under the "producer" group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the expected format and usage for specifying the AWS Secrets Manager region in an Apache Camel configuration using the "aws-secrets-manager" component, if this option is set to be optional?'
      answer: |
       'In an Apache Camel configuration using the "aws-secrets-manager" component, if you opt to specify the region as an optional parameter, you should provide the lowercase name of the AWS region (e.g., ap-east-1). To do this, use the property `Region.EU_WEST_1.id()`, which is expected by the configuration. Keep in mind that this is an optional setting and it''s not required if you wish to have the component work with the default region.'
    - question: 'How can I set a custom URI endpoint for the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component using the `uriEndpointOverride` option, and what is the purpose of this option when combined with the `overrideEndpoint` option?'
      answer: |
       'To set a custom URI endpoint for the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component, you can use the "uriEndpointOverride" option. This option should be used in conjunction with the "overrideEndpoint" option. The purpose of the "uriEndpointOverride" option is to allow you to specify an alternate URI endpoint for your AWS Secrets Manager resource. When both options are used together, it provides more flexibility in configuring how your Apache Camel application interacts with AWS Secrets Manager. Keep in mind that "uriEndpointOverride" has a default value of null and is optional in the configuration (it can be left out if not needed). The group for this option is specified as "producer".'
    - question: 'How does setting the "useProfileCredentialsProvider" option to true in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component affect the loading of credentials for the Secrets Manager client?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "useProfileCredentialsProvider" option to true in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component means that the Secrets Manager client will be configured to load its credentials through a profile credentials provider. This allows you to manage your AWS credentials using an AWS CLI configuration file, instead of hard-coding them directly into your application. When this option is set to true, the Secrets Manager client will look for the appropriate AWS credentials in the specified profile within your AWS CLI configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component, and under what circumstances might it be beneficial to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component allows you to control whether the producer should be started lazily (on the first message). This can be useful when a producer may otherwise fail during startup, causing the route to fail as well. By starting the producer lazily, you can handle any potential startup failures using Camel''s routing error handlers. However, be aware that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time, potentially prolonging the total processing time of the system. The default value for this option is false, meaning the producer starts immediately upon route startup. Setting it to true might be beneficial in cases where you want to ensure the CamelContext and routes can start even when a specific producer might cause issues during initial startup. This option falls under the "producer (advanced)" group.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the "secretsManagerClient" option in the Apache Camel aws-secrets-manager component, and is it required to do so if not provided with a default value?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the "secretsManagerClient" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component, you can use an existing configured AWS Secrets Manager client. However, this configuration is optional as it has no default value. If not provided, Camel will create a new AWS Secrets Manager client instance for you. This feature falls under the advanced group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "proxyHost" option in the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager", and is it required or optional when instantiating the Secrets Manager client? Also, does it have a default value and what data type should be provided if it is used?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyHost" option in the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager" serves the purpose of allowing you to define a proxy host when instantiating the Secrets Manager client. This means that if your environment requires a proxy server for communication with AWS Secrets Manager, you can set this option accordingly. It is an optional configuration as indicated by the "required: false". The default value for this option is null, so if you don''t need to use a proxy, it can be left unset. If used, the data type should be a string.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "proxyPort" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component, and is it required or optional when instantiating the Secrets Manager client? Also, what type of value should be provided if it is used, and are there any default or suggested values for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyPort" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component is intended to allow you to specify a proxy port when initializing the Secrets Manager client. This option is optional as indicated by the "required: false". If used, it should be provided as an integer value. However, there is no default value for this option, so you may need to provide a custom value based on your specific use case or network configuration. The "proxy" group suggests that this option might be relevant when dealing with proxy servers in the context of AWS Secrets Manager.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "proxyProtocol" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component, and is its use optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyProtocol" option within the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component serves to define a proxy protocol when initializing the Secrets Manager client. It''s an optional setting, meaning you can choose whether or not to include it. By default, if no specific value is provided for "proxyProtocol," the connection will use HTTPS (secure HTTP). This option falls under the "proxy" group of configuration options in the Secrets Manager component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and group affiliation of the "accessKey" option in the Apache Camel component named "aws-secrets-manager", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessKey" option within the Apache Camel component called "aws-secrets-manager" serves as a placeholder for your Amazon AWS Access Key. It doesn''t have a default value, meaning you must supply it yourself during configuration. This option is of data type string, and its group affiliation falls under security considerations due to its sensitive nature. Moreover, the use of "accessKey" in this component is not required; however, providing it allows for secure access to AWS resources.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it is required for the option "secretKey" in the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager"? Also, can you explain where this option fits within the context of security groupings?              In other words: What is the description, defaultValue (if any), type, requirement (required or not), and groups (security) for the ''secretKey'' option in the Apache Camel component ''aws-secrets-manager''?              Answer: The "secretKey" option in the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager" is an Amazon AWS Secret Key of type "string." It has a default value of null and is not a required option. It falls within the context of security groupings.'
      answer: |
       'The "secretKey" option in the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager" serves as an Amazon AWS Secret Key, which is of type "string."

    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "sessionToken" option in the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager", and is it required or optional? Also, can you explain when the use of this session token might be necessary?'
      answer: |
       'The "sessionToken" option in the Apache Camel AWS Secrets Manager component is a string value used to provide an Amazon AWS Session Token when the user needs to assume an IAM role. This token is optional, meaning it''s not always required for operation. The use of this session token becomes necessary when you''re working with temporary security credentials for AWS services like EC2 instances or when rotating access keys for improved security. These scenarios require temporarily assuming an IAM role to gain the necessary permissions, and the session token facilitates this process.'
    - question: 'How does setting the "trustAllCertificates" option to true within the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager" impact the handling of SSL certificates during communication, and is this behavior optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "trustAllCertificates" option to true within the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager" means that it will trust all SSL certificates presented during communication, regardless of their validity. This behavior can potentially expose your application to security risks such as man-in-the-middle attacks. It''s important to note that this behavior is optional; there is no requirement to turn it on. You should only use this option when you are confident about the SSL endpoint you are connecting to, and understand the potential security implications. This option falls under the "security" group of settings in the component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" option when using the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager", and is it required for configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" option, when working with the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager", determines whether the client should automatically load credentials through a default provider or expect static credentials to be provided explicitly. Its default value is false, meaning it''s set to load credentials through a default provider unless otherwise specified. While not required for configuration, setting this option can help manage how your AWS credentials are accessed within the context of your application. This falls under the "security" group of options in the configuration.'
    - question: 'How does setting the "useSessionCredentials" option to true in the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager" affect the operation, and when would it be necessary to utilize this feature?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "useSessionCredentials" option to true in the Apache Camel component "aws-secrets-manager" enables the client to expect using IAM Session Credentials for operations in Secrets Manager. This is helpful when a user needs to assume an IAM role for performing tasks in Secrets Manager, particularly if temporary credentials are required for enhanced security. Although not mandatory, this feature can be utilized under situations where you want to grant least privilege access, rotate or manage credentials effectively, and ensure secure handling of sensitive information.'
