seed_examples:
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and requirements for configuring the Apache Camel etcd3 component if the user decides not to provide a configuration object?'
      answer: |
       'If you decide not to provide a configuration object for the Apache Camel etcd3 component, it will use its default behavior. Since the "etcd3" component is of type "object", when no configuration object is provided, there will be no specific settings applied by default as indicated by the "defaultValue": null. However, keep in mind that this component falls under the "common" groups, meaning it adheres to general Camel configurations and may rely on global setting if applicable.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "endpoints" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component, how should it be configured with multiple servers using IPNameResolver, and what is its default value if not explicitly set?'
      answer: |
       'The "endpoints" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component serves to configure the endpoints of your etcd server. This can be done by specifying the IP addresses and ports of your etcd servers, separated by commas. To use multiple servers with IPNameResolver, you should provide a list of IP names that resolve to the IP addresses of your etcd servers. It''s important to note that this option is optional as it has a default value of `http://localhost:2379`. If you choose not to provide custom endpoints, Camel will use this default configuration for your etcd server connections.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the Apache Camel etcd3 option "keyCharset", and is it required when configuring this component? Also, in which group of options does the ''keyCharset'' option belong?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel etcd3 "keyCharset" option is UTF-8. It is a string type data and not required when configuring this component. This option belongs to the common group of options in the configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel component etcd3''s option named "namespace", and is it required when configuring this component? Also, what kind of data type does this option accept?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel component etcd3''s "namespace" option is used to configure the namespace for keys in the etcd3 cluster. If no namespace is specified ("/"), it will be treated as if no namespace has been set. This option accepts string data type and is not required when configuring the component, but it can help for better organization of your keys within the etcd3 cluster by grouping them under a specific namespace.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the boolean option "prefix" in the Apache Camel etcd3 component, and is it required for usage? (Answer: The "prefix" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component is used to apply an action on all key-value pairs whose key starts with a target path. It''s optional and its default value is false.)'
      answer: |
       'The boolean option "prefix" in the Apache Camel etcd3 component serves the purpose of applying an action on all key-value pairs whose key begins with a specified target path. By default, this option is set to false, meaning it''s not applied unless explicitly enabled. It is an optional setting, allowing users flexibility in their usage of the etcd3 component.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the Apache Camel etcd3 component''s bridgeErrorHandler option to enable bridging consumer exceptions to the routing Error Handler, if such a feature is supported by the etcd3 library?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel etcd3 component''s `bridgeErrorHandler` option to enable bridging consumer exceptions to the routing Error Handler, you need to set its value to true. Here''s an example of how you can do this in your Camel configuration:              ```xml       <bean id="etcdComponent" class="org.apache.camel.component.etcd3.Etcd3Component">           <property name="bridgeErrorHandler" value="true"/>           <!-- other component properties -->       </bean>       ```              Please note that this feature is only supported if the etcd3 library allows Camel to be alerted when an exception is thrown. If it does not, the `bridgeErrorHandler` will have no effect. In situations where the etcd3 library does not support this functionality, the consumer will use the default exception handling provided by Apache Camel, which logs exceptions at WARN or ERROR level and ignores them.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the optional Apache Camel component etcd3''s "fromIndex" option, and for what groups is this option considered relevant in terms of usage?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional Apache Camel component etcd3''s "fromIndex" option is an integer with a value of 0. This option is relevant for advanced users as it pertains to the consumer (advanced) groups within the context of usage.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel etcd3 component option titled "lazyStartProducer", and under what circumstances might it be beneficial to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component allows you to control whether the producer should start immediately upon context initialization or only upon the first message arrival. When set to true, the producer will start lazily, meaning it can help prevent the failure of a route during startup if the producer encounters issues at that time. Instead, any startup failures will be handled through Camel''s routing error handlers when messages are processed. However, keep in mind that deferring the startup may cause a slight delay in processing time as the producer is created and started for the first message. This option can be particularly beneficial in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during the starting process and cause the route to fail being started.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the optional configuration parameter "valueCharset" in the Apache Camel etcd3 component, and can it be omitted if not specified explicitly?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional configuration parameter "valueCharset" in the Apache Camel etcd3 component is UTF-8. This parameter, when set, configures the character set to use for the values and can be defined as a string type. If not specified explicitly, it can be omitted and will default to using UTF-8.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "authHeaders" option in the Apache Camel component "etcd3", and is it required or optional, and what is its default value and type?'
      answer: |
       'The "authHeaders" option in the Apache Camel component "etcd3" serves to configure headers that will be added to authentication request headers. It''s an optional configuration, as indicated by the "required: false". If not specified, it defaults to having no value (null). This option is categorized under advanced settings, denoted as "groups": "advanced".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "authority" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component, and is it a required configuration? (Answer: The authority option configures the authority used to authenticate connections to servers with no default value. It''s an optional configuration.)'
      answer: |
       'The "authority" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component is used to configure the authority that will be used to authenticate connections to servers. It does not have a default value, meaning you must provide it when configuring this option. This configuration is optional, as indicated by the "required: false".'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and required nature, as well as possible usage scenarios, of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component? Does it require configuration and how does it facilitate automating configurations like JDBC data sources or AWS clients?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component is a boolean setting with a default value of true, meaning autowiring is enabled by default. This option allows for automatic autowiring of options when there is a single instance of a matching type in the registry. This can be beneficial for automatically configuring components like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, and more. While it''s not required to configure this setting, you may find it useful in advanced scenarios where you wish to streamline your configuration process by leveraging the component''s ability to look up and automatically configure instances based on their types.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "connectionTimeout" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component, and is it mandatory to set a value for this option when configuring an etcd3 connection?'
      answer: |
       'The "connectionTimeout" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component is designed to configure the time duration before considering a connection as failed if no response is received. By default, it does not have a value set, meaning you can specify your preferred timeout according to your application''s needs. Setting a value for this option is not mandatory when configuring an etcd3 connection; however, providing one might help in managing and preventing timeouts due to slow responses from the etcd server.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "headers" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component, and is its use considered mandatory or optional? (Answer: The "headers" option in Apache Camel''s etcd3 component allows configuring headers to be added to HTTP request headers with a default value of null. Its use is considered optional.)'
      answer: |
       'The "headers" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component serves the purpose of allowing users to configure additional headers to be included in HTTP request headers. This option has a default value of null, meaning that if no custom headers are specified, no headers will be added beyond those required by the request. The use of this option is considered optional and is typically utilized within the advanced configuration group.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and the minimum allowable value for the Apache Camel etcd3 component option called "keepAliveTime", and is it required to be set when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "keepAliveTime" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component is 30 seconds, with a minimum allowable value of 10 seconds according to gRPC requirements. This configuration sets the interval for gRPC keepalives, and it''s not mandatory to set this option when using the component, as it belongs to the "advanced" group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and whether it''s mandatory to configure the Apache Camel etcd3 component option called "keepAliveTimeout", which is used to set the timeout for gRPC keepalives, and if there are any advanced groups associated with this configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel etcd3 component option "keepAliveTimeout" is 10 seconds. It''s not mandatory to configure this option as it controls the timeout for gRPC keepalives, but setting it allows you to control the time before a connection is considered idle. This configuration falls under the advanced group of settings in Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "loadBalancerPolicy" option in the Apache Camel component "etcd3", and is its usage considered essential (required) or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "loadBalancerPolicy" option in the Apache Camel component "etcd3" is used to configure the load balancing policy for an etcd cluster. By default, it has no value assigned ("defaultValue": null). Its usage is considered optional as it belongs to the advanced group of configuration options.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "maxInboundMessageSize" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component, and is it mandatory to set this value when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "maxInboundMessageSize" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component configures the maximum message size allowed for a single gRPC frame. Its default value is null, which means no limit is set initially. This option is used to prevent large messages from overwhelming your application and consuming excessive resources. However, setting this value is not mandatory; you can choose to leave it unconfigured if you prefer, but be aware that this could potentially impact the performance and stability of your application when dealing with larger messages. The "maxInboundMessageSize" option falls under the "advanced" group of configuration options.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the Apache Camel etcd3 option "retryDelay" and can it be configured as an optional advanced setting?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel etcd3 option "retryDelay" is 500 milliseconds. This configuration option controls the delay between retries in case of failures, and it can be set as an optional advanced setting.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the optional advanced configuration setting "retryMaxDelay" in the Apache Camel etcd3 component, and what unit of measurement does it use?'
      answer: |
       'The optional advanced configuration setting "retryMaxDelay" in the Apache Camel etcd3 component uses milliseconds as its unit of measurement. Its default value is an integer type with a default value of 2500 (or 2.5 seconds).'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "retryMaxDuration" option in the advanced group for the Apache Camel etcd3 component, if it''s not required?'
      answer: |
       'The "retryMaxDuration" option in the advanced group for the Apache Camel etcd3 component is configured to set the maximum duration for retries. It does not have a default value, meaning you must specify a value when using this option. This option is utilized when you want to control the time span within which the component will attempt to retry failed operations. If "retryMaxDuration" is not required in your use case, it can be left unspecified.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "servicePath" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component, and what is its default value if it''s not explicitly specified? Also, under which group of options does this particular option belong?'
      answer: |
       'The "servicePath" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component is used to specify the path where service discovery will be conducted. If not explicitly set, its default value is "/services/". This particular option belongs to the group of options called "cloud".'
    - question: '"What is the purpose, default value, data type, and required status of the ''password'' option in the Apache Camel component ''etcd3'', under which group this option falls within the context of security configurations?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''password'' option in the Apache Camel component ''etcd3'' is designed to configure etcd authentication using a password for enhanced security. By default, it does not have a value (defaultValue: null), making it optional to set during configuration. Regarding its data type, it is defined as a string ("type":"string"). This option falls under the ''security'' group within the context of your configurations, specifically dealing with authentication mechanisms.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel etcd3 component option called "sslContext" and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The option "sslContext" within the Apache Camel etcd3 component is designed to configure SSL/TLS context settings, allowing you to use customized security parameters instead of the system defaults. The default value for this option is null, meaning no predefined SSL/TLS context is set initially. It''s not mandatory to provide a value for this option as it can be left unused if you prefer using the system''s default SSL/TLS settings. Nevertheless, for enhanced security, it''s recommended to consider setting a custom SSL/TLS context when necessary, especially in scenarios that prioritize secure communication.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "userName" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component, and is it required for configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "userName" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component is designed to configure an authentication user for etcd. Its purpose is to add a layer of security by authenticating users before they can interact with the etcd cluster. However, it''s important to note that this option has no default value and its use is optional during configuration, meaning you are not required to provide a username if you don''t need to secure access to your etcd instance. The group associated with this option is "security", highlighting its role in maintaining the security of your system.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of setting the "endpoints" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component and how can multiple endpoints be configured using IPNameResolver? Also, what is the default value for this option and is it required when configuring the etcd3 component?'
      answer: |
       'The "endpoints" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component is used to configure the server endpoints of the etcd cluster. You can specify multiple endpoints by separating them with commas. To do this, you should utilize the IPNameResolver function. The default value for this option is http://localhost:2379, and it''s not a mandatory configuration parameter, meaning you can skip providing it if desired. This setting pertains to the "common" group within the etcd3 component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the optional configuration parameter "keyCharset" in the Apache Camel etcd3 component, and under what group can it be found if it''s not required to be set?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional configuration parameter "keyCharset" in the Apache Camel etcd3 component is UTF-8. It belongs to the data type string. If it''s not required to be set, you can find this group under "common".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "namespace" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component and what value should it have if I want to use a specific namespace for my keys in the etcd3 store? (The default value is null, so you can choose any non-null string value.)'
      answer: |
       'The "namespace" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component allows you to configure a specific namespace for your keys used in the etcd3 store. This means that each key you create will be prefixed with this namespace, making it easier to organize your data if you have numerous entries. If you wish to use a particular namespace for your keys, simply choose any non-null string value as per your preference. Keep in mind that if no namespace is specified, etcd3 will treat the key as being in no namespace.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the boolean option "prefix" in the Apache Camel component "etcd3", and is it required when using this component? Additionally, can you explain what group this option belongs to within the component''s options?'
      answer: |
       'The boolean option "prefix" in the Apache Camel component "etcd3" serves a purpose of applying an action on all key-value pairs whose key starts with the specified target path. By default, this option is set to false, meaning that it''s not applied unless explicitly activated. It is not required when using the etcd3 component as it provides flexibility for working with specific sets of data in the etcd3 store. This option belongs to the "common" group within the component''s options.'
    - question: 'How does the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component differ from the default exception handling behavior, and under what conditions can it be configured to bridge exceptions to the routing Error Handler?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component allows for bridging exceptions that occur while the consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages to be processed as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler. This is beneficial only when the third-party component permits Camel to be informed of an exception being thrown, as some components manage exceptions internally and bridgeErrorHandler may not be possible in these cases.              When configured, instead of using the default org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler for dealing with exceptions, which logs them at WARN or ERROR level and ignores them, the etcd3 component will pass exceptions to the routing Error Handler for processing as messages. This can be set through the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the consumer (advanced) group if you wish to utilize this feature.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the exceptionHandler option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component, its default value, and when it is not used by default? Also, can you explain the relationship between the option bridgeErrorHandler and exceptionHandler in the context of the etcd3 component?'
      answer: |
       'The `exceptionHandler` option in the Apache Camel `etcd3` component allows users to provide a custom ExceptionHandler. By default, the consumer will manage exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. However, if the `bridgeErrorHandler` option is enabled, the `exceptionHandler` is not in use. The relationship between these options lies in their handling of exceptions: while `exceptionHandler` provides a custom way to handle exceptions, `bridgeErrorHandler`, when active, redirects errors to the Camel error handling infrastructure. This means that if `bridgeErrorHandler` is enabled, any exception will be forwarded for global error handling rather than being managed by a custom `exceptionHandler`.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the Apache Camel etcd3 component''s "exchangePattern" option, and can it be configured during the usage of the consumer in advanced mode?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component is null. This option sets the exchange pattern when a consumer creates an exchange, which essentially defines how messages are exchanged between components in Camel. If you wish to configure it during advanced usage of the consumer, you can do so as the "exchangePattern" option is marked as optional and is found under the "consumer (advanced)" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and group association of the Apache Camel etcd3 option named "fromIndex" in the context of a consumer pattern? Is it required and if not, what is its default value when not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The "fromIndex" option for the Apache Camel etcd3 component serves as the index to start watching from within the etcd cluster. Its default value is 0. This option is of data type integer and can be omitted, in which case it will automatically use 0 if not specified. It is associated with the "consumer (advanced)" group, indicating that it may require a deeper understanding or more advanced usage of the Camel consumer pattern.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the option "valueCharset" in the Apache Camel etcd3 component, and is this configuration optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "valueCharset" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component is UTF-8. This option is of type string, meaning it can accept alphabetic, numeric, or special characters as input. It''s worth noting that setting this value is optional, not required, within the producer group of configurations.'
    - question: 'Given the information about the Apache Camel etcd3 component''s lazyStartProducer option, here is a question that can be answered by it:              "What is the purpose of the ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component and what are the benefits and potential drawbacks of using this feature?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component is designed to allow for delaying the startup of a producer until the first message is processed. This can be beneficial in situations where the producer might otherwise fail during the starting phase, causing the entire route to fail as well. By deferring the startup, any failure can be managed through Camel''s routing error handlers during message processing.              However, it''s important to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take a little extra time, which could prolong the total processing time of the route. This could potentially impact the overall performance of your application if used extensively or in scenarios requiring high throughput. But in situations where quick startup is not critical, ''lazyStartProducer'' can be a useful tool for managing potential failure points during CamelContext and route initialization.'
    - question: 'How should I configure the `authHeaders` option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component if I want to add specific headers to my authentication requests?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the `authHeaders` option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component to add specific headers to your authentication requests, you should define an object with the desired header keys as properties and their corresponding values as string values. Here''s an example:              ```javascript       {         "X-Custom-Header": "Custom Value",         "Authorization": "Bearer AccessToken"       }       ```              You can add this object to the `advanced` configuration section of your Camel route when using the etcd3 component:              ```java       from("etcd3://my-etcd-server?authHeaders=#authHeadersObject")         .process(yourProcessor);       ```              Make sure to replace `my-etcd-server` with your actual etcd server URL and assign the auth headers object (e.g., `authHeadersObject`) as per your requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the Apache Camel etcd3 option named "authority", which allows configuration for the string used to authenticate connections to etcd servers, and is an optional setting?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel etcd3 option named "authority" is null. This option allows you to configure the string used to authenticate connections to etcd servers, making it an advanced feature. It''s an optional setting, meaning you can choose whether or not to provide a specific authority for authentication during your connections to etcd servers.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "connectionTimeout" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component, and is it required for usage? (Answer: The default value is null, and it''s used to configure the connection timeout.)'
      answer: |
       'The "connectionTimeout" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component is designed to configure the connection timeout. By default, it has no specific value (null). This setting is optional; you''re not required to provide a connection timeout when using the etcd3 component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "headers" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component, and is its usage marked as required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "headers" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component is designed to configure the headers that will be added to HTTP request headers. By default, it does not have a value ("defaultValue": null). Its usage is marked as optional as indicated by "required": false. This option falls under the advanced group of settings designated as "groups":"advanced".'
    - question: 'What is the default value and minimum allowed configuration for the Apache Camel etcd3 component''s keepAliveTime option, which configures the interval for gRPC keepalives, and is this setting required when using the etcd3 component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "keepAliveTime" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component, which controls the interval for gRPC keepalives, is set to 30 seconds. However, the minimum allowed by gRPC is 10 seconds. This setting is optional and falls under the "advanced" group of configuration options, meaning it''s not necessarily required when using the etcd3 component.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "keepAliveTimeout" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component, and can it be configured if not set by default? (The default value is 10 seconds, and it can be configured even if not set by default.)'
      answer: |
       'The "keepAliveTimeout" option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component is responsible for configuring the timeout for gRPC keepalives. Its default value is 10 seconds. This setting ensures that the connection between components remains active even when there''s no data transfer, by sending periodic heartbeats. If not set by default, this option can still be configured within the advanced group of settings in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "loadBalancerPolicy" option in the Apache Camel component "etcd3", and is it mandatory to set a value for this option when configuring etcd3?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "loadBalancerPolicy" option in the Apache Camel component "etcd3" is null, meaning no specific load balancer policy is assigned by default. This option is used to configure the etcd load balancer policy. However, setting a value for this option is not mandatory; it falls under the "advanced" configuration group and can be skipped if you wish to use the default behavior or if you are not concerned with load balancing in your etcd3 setup.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the Apache Camel component etcd3''s maxInboundMessageSize option, and can it be left unspecified if not required?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel component "etcd3" has an option named "maxInboundMessageSize." This configuration parameter determines the maximum message size allowed for a single gRPC frame. By default, this value is not set (null). It''s used to control the maximum size of incoming messages handled by the etcd3 component. However, if the "maxInboundMessageSize" option is marked as "required: false," it can be left unspecified if not necessary in your application setup. This setting falls under the "advanced" group of options, indicating it might not be required for basic configurations but could be beneficial for managing large data transfers or preventing memory overflows when dealing with potentially large messages.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the retryDelay option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component and how can it be configured to set a custom delay between retries, if desired?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `retryDelay` option in the Apache Camel etcd3 component is 500 milliseconds. If you wish to set a custom delay between retries, you can configure it by adjusting this option according to your desired time (in milliseconds). This configuration is considered part of the advanced group, so make sure to adjust it accordingly in your settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the optional advanced setting "retryMaxDelay" in the Apache Camel etcd3 component, and how is it used within the context of this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional advanced setting "retryMaxDelay" in the Apache Camel etcd3 component is an integer of 2500 milliseconds. This setting configures the maximum backing off delay between retries when experiencing temporary failures during connection attempts or requests. If not specified explicitly, it will use this default value. It''s important to note that this setting falls under the "advanced" group, indicating its usage may be relevant for more in-depth configurations related to fine-tuning the behavior of the etcd3 component within Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "retryMaxDuration" option in the advanced group of the Apache Camel etcd3 component, and can it be set to a specific duration if not provided by default?'
      answer: |
       'The "retryMaxDuration" option in the advanced group of the Apache Camel etcd3 component is used to configure the maximum duration for which retries will be attempted. Its default value is null, meaning that there is no default duration specified. If you wish to set a specific duration for retry attempts, you can do so by providing an appropriate value when configuring this option.'
