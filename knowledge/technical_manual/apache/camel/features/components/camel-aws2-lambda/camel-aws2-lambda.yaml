    - question: 'What is the default configuration setting and whether it is required for the aws2-lambda Camel component when used as a producer, and are there any specific groups of options within its configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The `aws2-lambda` Camel component as a producer does not have a default configuration setting (defaultValue: null). It''s optional whether to provide component configuration (required: false) when using this component. There are specific groups of options within its configuration, grouped under the "producer" category.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of setting the Apache Camel option "lazyStartProducer" in an aws2-lambda component, what are its implications on route startup, and how does it affect the overall processing time?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the Apache Camel option "lazyStartProducer" in an aws2-lambda component enables lazy initialization of the producer, which means it won''t be started immediately during CamelContext and route startup. Instead, the producer will be launched upon processing the first message. This can be beneficial when a producer may otherwise fail during the starting process, potentially causing the entire route to fail.              By deferring the startup to lazy mode, failures due to producer initialization can be handled through Camel''s error-handling mechanisms during routing messages. However, there is an implication on the route startup time: as the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take a bit of time, thus prolonging the overall processing time compared to immediately initialized producers. This should be taken into account when considering using "lazyStartProducer" in your Camel applications deployed on AWS Lambda.'
    - question: 'What is the default operation for using the ''aws2-lambda'' component in Apache Camel, and which other operations are available for performing actions like listing, creating, deleting, or invoking AWS Lambda functions? (Hint: These operations can be specified under the "operation" option.)'
      answer: |
       'The default operation for utilizing the ''aws2-lambda'' component in Apache Camel is ''invokeFunction''. However, other available operations include ''listFunctions'', ''getFunction'', ''createFunction'', and ''deleteFunction'', all of which allow you to perform actions like listing, creating, deleting, or invoking AWS Lambda functions respectively.'
    - question: 'Here is a question that could be asked to clarify the usage and purpose of the `overrideEndpoint` option within the Apache Camel AWS2-Lambda component:              "In the context of using Apache Camel''s AWS2-Lambda producer, what are the use cases for setting the ''overrideEndpoint'' option, and when is it necessary to combine this option with the ''uriEndpointOverride'' option?"'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel AWS2-Lambda component, the `overrideEndpoint` option is used to indicate whether or not an existing endpoint should be overridden. This option needs to be employed in conjunction with the `uriEndpointOverride` option when you want to replace an already defined endpoint URL with a custom one.              Use cases for setting the `overrideEndpoint` option include:       - Overriding the default Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda execution endpoint with a specific custom endpoint for testing purposes.       - Modifying the endpoint used by the AWS Lambda component to access a different region or account when using multi-account strategies in your integration.       - Ensuring compatibility with newer versions of the AWS Lambda service while continuing to use existing endpoints for backwards compatibility reasons.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and requirement for using a POJO request as a body in an Apache Camel AWS2 Lambda producer, and is it possible to opt-out of this behavior if necessary?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior in an Apache Camel AWS2 Lambda producer when using POJO requests as bodies is set to false, meaning that it is not used by default. If you wish to utilize a POJO request as a body, it is optional but requires configuration. You can opt-out of this behavior if necessary, as the setting for this feature is configurable and not mandatory in the producer group.'
    - question: 'What should be the data type and value (if any) for the "region" option in an Apache Camel route that uses the aws2-lambda component, and is this option required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'In an Apache Camel route utilizing the aws2-lambda component, the "region" option should be a string type. If you choose to use this option, you would provide a lowercase version of the region name as its value, such as ap-east-1 or eu-west-1. It''s important to note that you can find the specific id for Region.EU_WEST_1 using the method `Region.EU_WEST_1.id()`. Regarding its requirement, this option is not mandatory since it''s marked as "required: false".'
    - question: '"What is the purpose and usage of the ''uriEndpointOverride'' option when working with the Apache Camel ''aws2-lambda'' component, and how does it interact with the ''overrideEndpoint'' option?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''uriEndpointOverride'' option for the AWS Lambda component in Apache Camel is designed to let you specify an alternative URI endpoint for your AWS Lambda function. This is useful when you want to override the default Lambda function URI. It''s essential to note that this option should be used in conjunction with the ''overrideEndpoint'' option, as it only becomes effective when overriding is enabled. For instance, if ''overrideEndpoint'' is set to true, you can provide a specific endpoint address using ''uriEndpointOverride''. This configuration comes under the producer group and isn''t mandatory, meaning you can choose to use or ignore this option depending on your specific use case.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel aws2-lambda component, and can it be left unspecified if not needed in a configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option within the Apache Camel aws2-Lambda component is designed for enabling automatic autowiring of instances based on specified options (marked as autowired). Its default value is true. This feature allows the component to search for a single instance of matching type in the registry and configure it, which is beneficial for setting up components such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, etc. However, if autowiring is not required in a configuration, this option can safely be left unspecified since its default value is already enabled.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "awsLambdaClient" option within the Apache Camel component "aws2-lambda", specifically if I want to utilize an already configured AwsLambdaClient object instead of creating a new one by default?'
      answer: |
       'The "awsLambdaClient" option in the Apache Camel AWS Lambda ("aws2-lambda") component is designed to enable you to use an existing, pre-configured AwsLambdaClient client rather than creating a new one by default during the execution of your integration tasks. This comes handy when you have already set up your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda client with specific configurations and you wish to reuse them without having to recreate the same setup. You can set this option to your pre-configured AwsLambdaClient object, allowing Camel to utilize it throughout the AWS Lambda integration process. The use of "awsLambdaClient" is classified under the advanced group of options within the component.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and requirement status (whether it''s optional or required), as well as the possible values and group assignment, of the ''healthCheckConsumerEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel ''aws2-lambda'' component?'
      answer: |
       'The ''healthCheckConsumerEnabled'' option in the AWS Lambda (''aws2-lambda'') component of Apache Camel is a boolean property, with a default value of true. It determines whether all consumer-based health checks are enabled or disabled from this specific component. This setting is optional as indicated by ''required'': false. It belongs to the ''health'' group. The possible values for this option are either true (enabling health checks) or false (disabling health checks).'
    - question: 'How does setting the Apache Camel component `aws2-lambda` option `healthCheckProducerEnabled` impact the health checks performed on this component, and what is its default value, as well as when should this option be used to adjust Camel''s built-in producer based health checks?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the Apache Camel component `aws2-lambda` option `healthCheckProducerEnabled` allows you to control whether all producer-based health checks are enabled or disabled from this specific component. By default, producer-based health checks are disabled in Camel. To enable these checks globally across all components, you can set `camel.health.producersEnabled=true`.              The option `healthCheckProducerEnabled` should be used when you need to explicitly manage the health checks for the AWS Lambda component. If you wish to modify Camel''s built-in producer based health checks, this is the setting you would adjust accordingly.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''proxyHost'' option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Lambda component, if it''s set to null by default and can be specified as a string when instantiating the Lambda client for configurations where a proxy server is required?'
      answer: |
       'The ''proxyHost'' option within the Apache Camel AWS2-Lambda component allows you to configure a proxy host when instantiating the Lambda client. This is particularly useful in scenarios requiring the use of a proxy server due to network restrictions. Although it''s not mandatory (since its default value is null), you can set this option to a string value that defines your proxy host for situations where one is needed.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "proxyPort" option in the Apache Camel aws2-lambda component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option? Also, what is the data type of this option and what range does it support if a value needs to be provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyPort" option in the AWS Lambda component (aws2-lambda) within Apache Camel serves to define a custom proxy port when instantiating the Lambda client. However, providing a value for this option is optional as its default value is null. If a value is provided, it should be an integer data type, and since no range is specified, any non-negative integer can potentially be used within your specific application requirements.'
    - question: 'How do you configure the AWS Lambda component in Apache Camel to use a specific proxy protocol (not HTTPS, as the default is already defined) during its instantiation? Is it possible to set this value via an option within the configuration?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the AWS Lambda component in Apache Camel to use a specific proxy protocol other than HTTPS during its instantiation, you can do so by setting the "proxyProtocol" option within the configuration. This can be done by specifying the desired protocol as a value when creating the Lambda client object. For example:              ```java       LambdaComponent lamdbaComponent = new LambdaComponent();       Options options = new Options();       options.setValue("proxyProtocol", "SOCKS5"); // replace with your preferred proxy protocol       LambdaEndpoint endpoint = lamdbaComponent.createEndpoint("aws-proxy:myArn?region=us-west-2", options);       ```'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value (if any), data type, and whether it is required for the ''accessKey'' option in the Apache Camel ''aws2-lambda'' component, under the security group category?'
      answer: |
       'The ''accessKey'' option within the Apache Camel ''aws2-lambda'' component falls under the security group category. It represents an Amazon AWS Access Key. The default value for this option is null as it needs to be provided by the user. The data type of the access key is a string, and it is not required but strongly recommended to include it to enable the usage of AWS Lambda functions within your Apache Camel setup.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''profileCredentialsName'' option in the Apache Camel ''aws2-lambda'' component when configuring security settings for accessing AWS Lambda functions? Also, is the use of this option mandatory or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The ''profileCredentialsName'' option in the ''aws2-Lambda'' component within Apache Camel, when configured for security settings, serves to specify a profile name if you''re using a profile credentials provider. This allows you to manage multiple AWS IAM user configurations or different AWS accounts by defining them in an AWS Credentials file or instance profile. The default value for this option is null, meaning it''s not set unless explicitly provided. Lastly, the use of this option is optional; its inclusion is dependent on your specific use case and credential management requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value (if any), data type, required status, and group affiliation of the ''secretKey'' option within the Apache Camel component ''aws2-lambda'', regarding Amazon AWS Secret Key?'
      answer: |
       'The ''secretKey'' option within the Apache Camel component ''aws2-lambda'' serves the purpose of providing an Amazon AWS Secret Access Key. By default, it has no preset value (defaultValue: null). Its data type is a string ("type": "string"). Whether it''s required to use this option is optional (required: false). It falls under the ''security'' group due to its sensitive nature and handling of confidential information related to AWS credentials.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of using the "sessionToken" option in the Apache Camel aws2-lambda component, whether it''s required, its default value, type and any associated groups?'
      answer: |
       'The "sessionToken" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Lambda component is used when you need to assume an IAM role in Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is an Amazon AWS Session Token, which provides temporary security credentials for an AWS user or an application that needs access to AWS resources. Unlike other options, using the sessionToken is not mandatory, and it does not have a default value. It is of type "string". In terms of associated groups, it falls under the "security" group as managing AWS security tokens involves handling sensitive data.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "trustAllCertificates" option within the Apache Camel component "aws2-lambda", and what is its default value and required status? Also, when might it be necessary to set this option to true? (Security group)'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s AWS Lambda (aws2-lambda) component, the "trustAllCertificates" option is a security-related feature. Its purpose is to allow Camel to trust all SSL/TLS certificates presented by an endpoint without verifying them, thereby overriding the standard certificate validation process. This can be useful when you want or need to make non-verified connections to a specific Lambda function, such as during development or testing phases where self-signed or untrusted certificates might be in use. However, it is important to note that setting this option to true introduces security risks by bypassing normal certificate validation, so it should only be used when strictly necessary and the implications are well understood. The default value for this option is false (certificate verification is enabled), and it can be set to true if required within the "security" group of configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" option within the Apache Camel component "aws2-lambda", and what is its default value? Does it require being set, and if not, to which group does it belong in terms of the component''s options?'
      answer: |
       'The "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" option in the Apache Camel AWS Lambda ("aws2-lambda") component determines whether the client should load credentials through a default provider or receive static credentials. Its default value is set to false, indicating that it does not load credentials by default. While not required, it belongs to the security group of options within the component''s settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "useProfileCredentialsProvider" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Lambda component, and can it be configured as optional (true/false) for security purposes?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "useProfileCredentialsProvider" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Lambda component is false. This option determines whether the Lambda client should expect to load credentials through a profile credentials provider, enhancing security by allowing you to use an AWS CLI configuration file or environment variables to manage your credentials without hardcoding sensitive information directly into your code. It can be configured as optional (true/false) for security purposes.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "useSessionCredentials" option within the Apache Camel AWS2-Lambda component, and what is its default value, as well as whether it''s required for use? Also, could you explain a scenario where enabling this option might be beneficial?'
      answer: |
       'The "useSessionCredentials" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Lambda component is intended to determine if the Lambda client should utilize Session Credentials for carrying out operations. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the user needs to assume an IAM role within Lambda. The default value of this boolean property is false, meaning that Session Credentials are not expected by default. While not required, enabling this option can be beneficial when you want to temporarily grant a user access to resources under another IAM role for specific tasks in your AWS Lambda function.'
    - question: 'What is the default Apache Camel operation for the aws2-lambda component when no operation is specified?'
      answer: |
       'The default operation for the AWS Lambda component in Apache Camel, when no operation is specified, is "invokeFunction".'
    - question: 'How does setting the `overrideEndpoint` option within an Apache Camel component called `aws2-lambda` impact its behavior, and when is it required or optional to use this option along with the `uriEndpointOverride` option?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `overrideEndpoint` option in an Apache Camel component named `aws2-lambda` allows you to specify the necessity of overriding the endpoint. This option should be employed in conjunction with the `uriEndpointOverride` option. The `overrideEndpoint` defaults to false, meaning that if it is not explicitly set to true, the default behavior will be not to override the endpoint. Its usage is optional, but for cases where you need to manually configure an alternate endpoint address, setting `overrideEndpoint=true` along with a custom URI in `uriEndpointOverride` would facilitate such manual configuration. In other words, it''s mainly relevant for the producer group when dealing with producing messages to an Amazon Web Services Lambda function.'
    - question: 'Here is a possible question based on the provided information:              "In an Apache Camel project using AWS Lambda, can we opt to send a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) as the body of a request when using the aws2-lambda component? If so, how do we configure this option and what is its default value?"'
      answer: |
       'In an Apache Camel project utilizing AWS Lambda, it''s indeed possible to send a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) as the body of a request when using the ''aws2-lambda'' component. To configure this option, you can set the "option" attribute to "pojoRequest" in your route configuration where the AWS Lambda producer is used. By default, this option is set to false, meaning that a POJO will not be used as the request body. However, when you set it to true, Apache Camel will serialize the provided POJO object into JSON before sending the request to AWS Lambda.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "region" option in the Apache Camel aws2-lambda component, and how should it be specified if a default region is not provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "region" option in the Apache Camel''s AWS Lambda (aws2-lambda) component defines the Amazon Web Services (AWS) region where your Lambda function operates. If you choose to use this parameter, your configuration should provide the lowercase name of the desired region (for example, eu-west-1). In case a default region is not specified, it will not have any value by default. However, you can use the `Region.EU_WEST_1.id()` function to set a specific region when configuring your Camel route. This helps ensure that the Lambda client is functioning correctly within the chosen AWS region.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the ''uriEndpointOverride'' option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Lambda component, and under what conditions should it be used in conjunction with the ''overrideEndpoint'' option? Also, what is the default value for this option, and is its use mandatory or optional within the producer group?'
      answer: |
       'The ''uriEndpointOverride'' option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Lambda component allows you to set an overriding URI endpoint. This option should be used in combination with the ''overrideEndpoint'' option for specific purposes. When you want to customize the Lambda function URI, you would utilize these options together. The default value for ''uriEndpointOverride'' is null, meaning it''s not set by default. Its use is optional within the producer group. In other words, while it can be employed if desired, it''s not a mandatory requirement.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component "aws2-lambda", and under what circumstances might it be advantageous to set it to true instead of its default false?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component "aws2-lambda" determines whether the producer should be started lazily (on the first message). This setting can be beneficial when you want to allow the CamelContext and routes to start up in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during startup, thus causing the route failure. By deferring the startup of the producer, any startup failures can be managed during routing messages using Camel''s error handling mechanisms.              It''s important to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer will take some time and could potentially prolong the overall processing time. The default value of "lazyStartProducer" is false; however, setting it to true may be advantageous under scenarios where you anticipate potential failures during initial startup that can be handled using Camel''s error routing mechanisms. This option falls under the advanced group "producer".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and optional usage of the "awsLambdaClient" option in the Apache Camel "aws2-lambda" component, and can it be provided with a default value or it must always be user-defined?'
      answer: |
       'The "awsLambdaClient" option in the Apache Camel "aws2-lambda" component is an advanced configuration option used to leverage an existing configured AwsLambdaClient client when integrating AWS Lambda functions with your Camel route. Although not required, this option can be provided if you already have a prepared AwsLambdaClient instance rather than creating a new one within the Camel context. By default, no value is set for this option, meaning it must typically be user-defined when needed in your integration setup.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''proxyHost'' option in the Apache Camel component ''aws2-lambda'', and can it be specified as an optional parameter, bypassing a default value?'
      answer: |
       'The ''proxyHost'' option in the AWS2-Lambda component of Apache Camel is used to define a proxy host when instantiating the Lambda client. This means that if you wish to use a proxy server to communicate with your Lambda function, you can specify the host of this proxy using the ''proxyHost'' option. It''s important to note that specifying ''proxyHost'' is an optional parameter; it can be omitted if no proxy server is required, and in such cases, the default value will not apply as there is none defined for this option.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "proxyPort" option in the Apache Camel component "aws2-lambda", and does it have a default value, or does its usage require configuration? Additionally, where would you find this option grouped in relation to other options within the Camel configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyPort" option in the Apache Camel component "aws2-lambda" serves to define a proxy port when instantiating the Lambda client. Its usage is optional, meaning it doesn''t have a default value and can be configured if needed. This option can be found grouped under the "proxy" section in the overall Camel configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and usage of the "proxyProtocol" option within the Apache Camel component "aws2-lambda", if it''s configured to define a proxy protocol when instantiating the Lambda client, and is an optional (not required) property in the configuration groups related to the proxy?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyProtocol" option within the Apache Camel component "aws2-lambda" is an optional property that allows you to define a proxy protocol when instantiating the Lambda client. By default, it is set to HTTPS, meaning if no specific value is provided, the communication will be over HTTPS. This configuration group is related to the proxy settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and type of the optional configuration property ''accessKey'' in the Apache Camel aws2-lambda component, and what is its default value if not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The optional configuration property ''accessKey'' in the Apache Camel aws2-lambda component is used to provide your Amazon AWS Access Key for authentication purposes. This string type property has a default value of null, meaning it will not be set automatically if left unspecified during component setup.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "profileCredentialsName" option in the Apache Camel component "aws2-lambda", and is it optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "profileCredentialsName" option in the Apache Camel component "aws2-lambda" is used to set a specific profile name when using a credentials provider that relies on AWS profiles. This parameter allows for switching between different sets of AWS credentials without modifying the configuration for each invocation of the Lambda function. Its default value is null, meaning if no explicit profile is specified, it won''t be used (the default credentials will be applied). The use of this option is not mandatory, as you can also provide credentials directly in the configuration if preferred. This feature falls under the ''security'' group since handling AWS credentials appropriately helps maintain the security of your Lambda functions.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value (if any), data type, and whether it is required for the "secretKey" option within the Apache Camel component "aws2-lambda", as well as which group it falls under in terms of security considerations?'
      answer: |
       'The "secretKey" option within the AWS Lambda component in Apache Camel is a string data type that, by default, has no value (null). It is intended for providing your Amazon AWS Secret Key, although it is not required to use this option. From a security perspective, it falls under the group called "security." This indicates that handling and securing the secretKey appropriately is crucial to protect your AWS Lambda functions'' credentials.'
    - question: 'How is a session token specified in the AWS2-Lambda component of Apache Camel for a scenario where the user intends to assume an IAM role using temporary security credentials, if the option has no default value?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of AWS2-Lambda within Apache Camel, you do not specify a default session token as it is dynamically obtained. To assume an IAM role using temporary security credentials when there''s no default value for the session token option, you''d typically retrieve the temporary credentials using the STS (Security Token Service) AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity or AssumeRole operations. These operations return temporary security credentials including the session token, which you can then utilize in your AWS Lambda function invocations as necessary.'
    - question: '"In the Apache Camel component ''aws2-lambda'', what is the purpose and default value of the optional boolean configuration option ''trustAllCertificates'' related to security?"'
      answer: |
       'The optional boolean configuration setting ''trustAllCertificates'' in the ''aws2- lambda'' component of Apache Camel is designed to handle situations where you want to bypass certificate validation, effectively trusting all certificates when communicating with an endpoint. This setting defaults to false, meaning that certificate validation is performed as usual. If set to true, it can be helpful during development or testing scenarios where dealing with self-signed or untrusted certificates is common. Keep in mind that this option falls under the ''security'' group and should only be used with caution, since disabling certificate validation introduces security risks when connecting to actual production resources.'
    - question: 'In regards to the Apache Camel aws2-lambda component, what is the default setting for the useDefaultCredentialsProvider option and when should it be set to true? The option is used to decide whether the Lambda client will load credentials through a default provider or expect static credentials.'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel `aws2-lambda` component, the default value for the `useDefaultCredentialsProvider` option is false. This setting determines whether the Lambda client should expect to load AWS credentials through a default provider (like ~/.aws/credentials) or if you want to pass static credentials directly. Setting it to true will make the Lambda client use a default provider to load its credentials, which can be beneficial when you don''t want to hard-code AWS credentials into your code. However, you may want to set it to true only when your application runs in an environment where default providers are accessible and secure, such as on a developer''s workstation or an Amazon Web Services (AWS) managed service, and the specific needs of your use case support this method of credential provisioning.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel aws2-lambda component to set credentials using a profile credentials provider, instead of directly providing AWS credentials? Is it necessary to specify this option and what is its default value if not specified?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the AWS Lambda component in Apache Camel to use a profile credentials provider instead of directly providing AWS credentials, you can set the `useProfileCredentialsProvider` option to `true`. By default, this option is `false`, meaning that the client does not load credentials through a profile credentials provider. Specifying this option is not mandatory; if it''s not provided, the component will use its default behavior.'
    - question: 'How does setting the "useSessionCredentials" option to true in the Apache Camel aws2-lambda component affect the behavior of the Lambda client, and why might this be useful when assuming an IAM role for operations within a Lambda function?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "useSessionCredentials" option to true in the Apache Camel aws2-Lambda component instructs the Lambda client to expect and utilize Session Credentials during runtime. This is beneficial when using Lambda functions to execute tasks that require assuming an IAM role for performing certain operations. With Session Credentials, the function can temporarily assume the specified IAM role and access the necessary AWS services with the appropriate permissions associated with the role. Conversely, setting this option to false indicates that the Lambda client should use its default credentials for executing the operation. By making use of Session Credentials when needed, you can achieve fine-grained access control within your Lambda functions.'
