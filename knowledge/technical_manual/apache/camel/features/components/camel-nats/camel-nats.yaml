seed_examples:
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "servers" option in the Apache Camel component "nats", and can this option be left empty or undefined by default? Furthermore, how should we specify multiple NAT servers if we need to connect to more than one server using this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "servers" option in the Apache Camel NATS (Networked Asynchronous Techniques) component is used to provide URLs for one or more NAT servers. You can specify multiple URLs by separating them with commas, such as `url1, url2`. This option is not required to be filled, it has a default value of null, which means that if no specific server is specified, Camel won''t connect to any NAT servers initially. In cases where you need to connect to multiple NAT servers, follow the format `url1, url2` in the servers option. The "servers" option falls under the "common" group of options for easy identification and management.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and whether it''s required to use the "verbose" option in the Apache Camel NATS component, if I want to enable verbose mode during my project execution?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "verbose" option in the Apache Camel NATS component is `false`, meaning it''s not enabled by default. Using verbose mode is optional; you can choose to require it during your project execution if desired, but it''s not required.'
    - question: 'Given the information provided about the Apache Camel NATS component''s bridgeErrorHandler option, here''s a question you might want to ask:              "When using the Apache Camel NATS component in a project, if an exception occurs while the consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages, will it be automatically handled by the routing Error Handler? And what should I set for the bridgeErrorHandler option to ensure this behavior?"'
      answer: |
       'When using the Apache Camel NATS component in a project, an exception that occurs while the consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages will not be automatically handled by the routing Error Handler unless you specifically configure it. To enable this behavior, you should set the `bridgeErrorHandler` option to `true`. By default, exceptions are logged and ignored.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel nats component''s "lazyStartProducer" option, and when should this option be set to true to avoid issues during route startup? Also, can you explain why setting this option may affect the overall processing time of messages?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel NATS component''s "lazyStartProducer" option is designed to control whether the producer should initiate in a lazy manner (on first message). By choosing the lazy start, you can enable CamelContext and routes to launch without encountering potential producer failures during initialization that may otherwise result in the route failing to start. In such scenarios where setting this option to true ensures that startup failures are managed through Camel''s routing error handlers.              However, it is important to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some additional time, prolonging the overall processing duration of messages. This should be taken into account, especially in scenarios where quick response times are critical.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel NATS component affect the configuration of the component, specifically when it comes to auto-configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, and so forth? And can this feature be disabled, and if yes, what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel NATS component enables automatic autowiring of options for components that are marked as ''autowired''. This means, during configuration, Camel will automatically look up instances of a matching type within the registry to configure the component. This feature is particularly useful when configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, and similar resources, since it simplifies the setup process by reducing the need for manual configurations.              However, it''s worth noting that this feature can be disabled if necessary. The default value for the "autowiredEnabled" option is ''true'', meaning automatic autowiring is enabled by default in the NATS component. When this feature is disabled, you will need to explicitly configure each component instance yourself instead of letting Camel handle it automatically.'
    - question: '"What is the purpose of using the ''headerFilterStrategy'' option in the Apache Camel NATS component, and how can a custom org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy be implemented to filter headers of a Camel message?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''headerFilterStrategy'' option in the Apache Camel NATS component serves the purpose of enabling you to apply a custom strategy for filtering headers to and from Camel messages. This is useful when you wish to control or modify the headers sent with your messages based on specific requirements.              To implement a custom org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy, you would need to create a Java class that extends this interface. The implementation should provide methods to filter both incoming and outgoing headers. Upon setting up the NATS component in Camel route configuration, you can then reference your custom HeaderFilterStrategy implementation for applying header-level transformations as desired.'
    - question: '"What is the purpose and default value of the ''useGlobalSslContextParameters'' option in the Apache Camel NATS component, and when might this option be set to true?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''useGlobalSslContextParameters'' option in the Apache Camel NATS component allows for the enablement of global SSL context parameters. By default, this option is set to false. When you want to use a globally defined SSL context for all NATS connections rather than defining separate ones per connection, you may consider setting this option to true for enhanced security configuration management in your application''s ''security'' group.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the Apache Camel component NATS''s configuration option named "connectionTimeout", and can it be omitted if set in the configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the connectionTimeout option of the Apache Camel NATS component is an integer of 2000 milliseconds (or 2 seconds). This option sets a timeout for connection attempts. It''s an optional setting, so if it''s not explicitly defined in your configuration, the default value will be used. The data type for this configuration option is "integer".'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and optional nature of the ''flushConnection'' option in the Apache Camel NATS component, and how does changing its value impact the connection handling while stopping?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the ''flushConnection'' option in the Apache Camel NATS component is set to true. This means that when you choose to stop the component, it will automatically flush (close or empty) any ongoing connections. However, changing its value to false allows for the option not to be executed upon stopping the connection. This could potentially leave some connections open if desired. It''s important to note that this setting can influence how your application handles connections while stopping, so adjusting it according to your use case is essential.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the Apache Camel component NATS option named "flushTimeout", and is it required when configuring this option? Also, can you specify where this option can be found within the configuration groups?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel component NATS option named "flushTimeout" is 1000 milliseconds (ms). This option allows you to set a timeout value in milliseconds for message flushing. It''s important to note that this option is of type integer, and while it''s not required, it can be configured if desired. The "flushTimeout" option can be found within the common configuration groups when setting up your Apache Camel components using NATS.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the option "maxPingsOut" in the Apache Camel NATS component, and is it mandatory to set this value when configuring the component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the option "maxPingsOut" in the Apache Camel NATS component is an integer 2, which represents the maximum number of pings allowed by the client before considering a connection dead if no response is received. It is not mandatory to set this value as it has a default value, but it can be adjusted according to specific application needs, falling under the "common" groups of configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the default number of maximum reconnection attempts allowed when using the Apache Camel NATS component, and is it possible to override this value if not needed?'
      answer: |
       'The default number of maximum reconnection attempts allowed when utilizing the Apache Camel NATS component is 60. It''s important to note that this value can be overridden if necessary as the option "maxReconnectAttempts" is configurable. You can find the configuration in the group named "common".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel nats component''s "noEcho" option, and what is its default value when not specified? Also, can you explain in what circumstances turning on this flag would be beneficial to the user?'
      answer: |
       'The "noEcho" option for the Apache Camel NATS component allows users to disable message echoing when connecting to a gnatsd server. By default, if no value is specified, this option is set to false, meaning messages will be echoed back by the server when subscriptions are present on the subject being published to.              Turning off the echo functionality can prove beneficial in scenarios where high volumes of data are being transmitted between client and server, reducing network traffic, improving performance, and minimizing potential latency issues caused by echoed messages. Additionally, when the focus is mainly on data production and not necessarily on real-time monitoring of message traffic, disabling echo helps streamline communication and optimize the system''s overall efficiency.'
    - question: 'Here is a question related to the "noRandomizeServers" option in the Apache Camel NATS component:              Can you explain what happens when the "noRandomizeServers" option is set to true while working with the Apache Camel NATS component? Does this configuration affect the order of server connection attempts in any way, and how can this option be useful for managing a connection to multiple NATS servers?'
      answer: |
       'When the "noRandomizeServers" option is set to true while working with the Apache Camel NATS component, it disables the randomization of server order for connection attempts. Instead, the component will try to establish connections in the exact order they are listed in the configuration. This behavior can be useful for managing a connection to multiple NATS servers, especially when you want to ensure that a specific server is always selected first or when load balancing based on a defined sequence of servers is preferred.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and description of the "pedantic" option within the Apache Camel NATS component, and is it required for use? Additionally, can you provide information about how using this option could impact performance?'
      answer: |
       'The "pedantic" option within the Apache Camel NATS component is a boolean configuration, with a default value of false. Its purpose is to decide whether running in pedantic mode or not. Enabling this option can impact the performance, as it affects how thoroughly Camel checks and validates its configurations. It''s worth noting that using this option is optional; you are free to use it according to your specific application needs. If you choose to use it and set it to true, be prepared for potentially reduced performance due to increased validation checks.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the Apache Camel NATS option "pingInterval" in milliseconds, and can it be considered a required configuration option? Also, to which group of options does this setting belong?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "pingInterval" option under Apache Camel''s NATS component is 120000 milliseconds (or 2 minutes), and it is not a required configuration option. This setting belongs to the common group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the default setting for the Apache Camel NATS component''s "reconnect" option, and can this feature be disabled if required?'
      answer: |
       'The default setting for the Apache Camel NATS component''s "reconnect" option is true, meaning that the reconnection feature is enabled by default. If you require, this feature can be disabled as it is an optional parameter.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the optional Apache Camel NATS component configuration parameter named `reconnectTimeWait`, and in what units is it measured?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional Apache Camel NATS component configuration parameter `reconnectTimeWait` is an integer 2000 milliseconds. It defines the waiting time before reconnection attempts are made, and it is a measure in milliseconds.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type, as well as whether it''s required for the Apache Camel component NATS''s "requestCleanupInterval" option, which is used to specify the interval to clean up cancelled or timed out requests? Is it optional and what are its possible values?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "requestCleanupInterval" option in the Apache Camel NATS component is an integer of 5000 (milliseconds). It''s an optional configuration, meaning you can choose to provide a different value if desired. Its possible values can be any positive integer, indicating the interval at which cancelled or timed out requests will be cleaned up. The group associated with this option is "common".'
    - question: 'What is the correct format for specifying multiple NAT (NATS) servers using the Apache Camel component "nats" option named "servers", if any? And is it required to specify any NAT servers when using this option?'
      answer: |
       'The correct format for specifying multiple NAT (NATS) servers using the Apache Camel component "nats" option named "servers" involves separating each URL with a comma. If you wish to provide more than one NAT server address, make sure to enlist them in this manner: "URL1, URL2, URL3". It''s important to note that specifying NAT servers is optional; if no servers are provided, the component will not use any NAT servers by default.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "verbose" option in the Apache Camel NATS component, and is it mandatory to set this option when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "verbose" option in the Apache Camel NATS component is false, which means that it will not run in verbose mode by default. However, setting this option to true is optional if you wish to enable verbose output when using this component.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "maxMessages" option in the Apache Camel NATS component when configuring consumers, if it is not specified explicitly?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "maxMessages" option in the Apache Camel NATS component, when configuring consumers, is null. This option sets a limit on the number of messages to receive from a specific topic before stopping message consumption. If not specified explicitly, there will be no limit to the number of messages received from the topic.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the Apache Camel NATS component option ''poolSize'' and can it be configured, if yes, are there any restrictions on its value when not specified explicitly?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel NATS component option ''poolSize'' is 10. This option determines the size of the consumer thread pool. You can configure it to change the number of threads that will be used to consume messages, although specifying a value is optional. If you don''t explicitly set its value, it will default to 10. The type of this configuration parameter is integer, meaning only numerical values are accepted.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "queueName" option in the Apache Camel NATS component when setting up a queue configuration, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "queueName" option within the Apache Camel NATS component serves as a designated identifier for a queue if you''re employing NATS for your queue setup. However, there is no default value assigned to this option, meaning it can be set to any suitable string value or left empty, as the requirement for providing a value is optional. The group associated with this option belongs to consumers within your system setup.'
    - question: 'In relation to using the Apache Camel NATS component, could you explain when it would be beneficial to set the "replyToDisabled" option to true, and how this affects the behavior of consuming messages?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the Apache Camel NATS component, setting the "replyToDisabled" option to true would be beneficial in scenarios where you don''t need or want the consumer to send back a reply message when processing a published message. Enabling this option will disable the sending of response messages, which may simplify the communication between your producer and consumer. This can lead to more streamlined handling of messages and potentially reduce complexity in certain use cases. However, it''s important to note that setting "replyToDisabled" to true is optional and only affects the consumer behavior when processing messages within a NATS-based architecture.'
    - question: 'How can you enable the option "bridgeErrorHandler" in the Apache Camel NATS component to bridge any exceptions that occur while trying to pickup incoming messages to the routing Error Handler, if this feature is supported by the third-party NATS component?'
      answer: |
       'To enable the "bridgeErrorHandler" option for exception handling in the Apache Camel NATS component, you should set its value to `true` when configuring your consumer settings. Here''s a simple example:              ```java       from("nats:" + natsUrl) // Your NATS URL here               .bridgeErrorHandler(true)               .to("direct:myRoute");       ```              Note that this feature will only work if the NATS component supports alerting Camel of an exception, which may not be the case for all implementations. If the NATS component doesn''t allow bridging exceptions, the consumer will instead use the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler` to deal with exceptions by logging at WARN or ERROR level and ignoring them.'
    - question: 'Given the information provided for the Apache Camel NATS component''s `exceptionHandler` option, here is a question you could ask:              "What happens when the `exceptionHandler` option is not specified for the NATS consumer in Apache Camel, and how can we configure a custom exception handler for exceptional cases?"'
      answer: |
       'When the `exceptionHandler` option is not specified for the NATS consumer in Apache Camel, the system will handle exceptions by default. These exceptions will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and will be ignored without any custom handling. To configure a custom exception handler, you can set the `exceptionHandler` option to an object that implements your desired error-handling behavior within your NATS consumer configuration under the "consumer (advanced)" group. If the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled, however, this `exceptionHandler` option will not be in use.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel NATS component, if it''s set to be optional, and what is its default value? Also, where can this option be found when configuring a consumer using the NATS component in Camel?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel NATS component is an advanced configuration setting that determines the exchange pattern when a consumer creates an exchange. This option is optional, meaning it''s not necessary to set it if you are using the default value, which is null. You can find this option within the consumer configuration group while configuring a consumer using the NATS component in Camel.'
    - question: 'How can I set the subject for response when using the reply feature with the Apache Camel NATS producer component, if I choose not to use the default value for it?'
      answer: |
       'To set a custom response subject when using the reply feature with the Apache Camel NATS producer component without using the default value, you can specify it explicitly as a string within your message content or message properties before sending the message. In the Camel route configuration, ensure to include a Processor where you set the required subject value in the message header (e.g., `message.getHeaders().put("CamelNATSReplySubject", "my-custom-subject")`) prior to using the `.to(natsEndpointUri)` method for sending messages with reply functionality enabled.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the optional Apache Camel component nats "requestTimeout" option that affects the producer, and when is it applicable if not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The optional Apache Camel component "nats" parameter named "requestTimeout" is an integer value set to the default of 20000 milliseconds. This timeout setting applies to the producer, governing how long a request may take before being considered timed out if not specified explicitly during its use.'
    - question: 'Here is a potential question about the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel NATS component:              In what scenario would it be beneficial to set the "lazyStartProducer" option to true for a producer in a route using the Apache Camel NATS component? Can you explain the potential impact on the total processing time of messages and how this can be handled effectively?'
      answer: |
       'In scenarios where a producer might fail during the starting phase and cause the entire route to fail as well, setting the "lazyStartProducer" option to true for a producer in an Apache Camel NATS component can be beneficial. This option allows the producer to defer startup until the first message arrives. By doing so, if an issue arises during production creation, it can be handled during message routing using Camel''s error handlers.              However, please keep in mind that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some additional time, potentially prolonging the total processing time of messages. To mitigate this impact, ensure to optimize your application and consider resource availability when handling production creation errors, or utilize efficient error-handling strategies to minimize performance degradation.'
    - question: 'How do I reference an existing NATS connection when using the Apache Camel `nats` component in my Camel route, if I choose not to use the default value for the `connection` option?'
      answer: |
       'To reference an already instantiated connection to a NATS server when using the Apache Camel `nats` component in your Camel route, you can pass an existing instance of the NatConnection object as the value for the `connection` option. Since you have chosen not to use the default value for this option, make sure to explicitly provide your custom connection object while configuring the nats component in your route. For example:              ```java       MyNatsConnection myCustomNatsConnection = ... // Your custom NatConnection instance here       from("nats:" + myCustomNatsConnection)           ... // Rest of your Camel route configuration       ```'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "headerFilterStrategy" option in the Apache Camel NATS component, and what values can be assigned to it in order to customize its header filtering behavior? Also, can you explain whether this option is required when configuring this component, or if it is considered an advanced feature?'
      answer: |
       'The "headerFilterStrategy" option in the Apache Camel NATS component defines the strategy for filtering headers during message exchange. This is an optional, advanced feature that can be configured to customize the header filtering behavior based on your specific needs. The assigned values for this option would typically be custom objects (functions or strategies) implementing header filtering logic according to your use case requirements. For instance, you could create a custom header filter strategy that excludes certain headers, modifies them, or adds new headers during the message exchange.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "traceConnection" option in the Apache Camel NATS component, and is it mandatory or optional to configure this option?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "traceConnection" option in the Apache Camel NATS component is false. This option determines whether connection trace messages should be printed to standard out for detailed debugging of connection issues. It''s an optional configuration, meaning you are not required to set it when using this component, but enabling it can help fine-tune and troubleshoot connections if necessary. The group where this option resides is the "advanced" group, indicating that it might be useful for more advanced users who need a higher level of control and debugging capabilities.'
    - question: 'In using the Apache Camel NATS component, if we set the `useCredentialsFile` option to true, what is the purpose of setting the `credentialsFilePath` option, and where can it be specified from? Also, can you explain what values can be used for this option, including the default value and any common prefixes that might be used?'
      answer: |
       'When using the Apache Camel NATS component and setting the `useCredentialsFile` option to true, the `credentialsFilePath` option becomes necessary. Its purpose is to specify the path where your credentials file is located, which can be loaded from various systems. By default, it does not have a value.              You can set this option in several ways: directly as a string, prefixed with "classpath:" to load it from the classpath, or using "file:" or "http:" to load the resource from your file system or an HTTP server respectively. It is important to note that this option falls under the security group.              In summary, when `useCredentialsFile` is true, you need to provide a path to your credentials through the `credentialsFilePath` option, using classpath, file, or http prefixes as required.'
    - question: 'What is the default value, data type, and required status of the "secure" option in the Apache Camel NATS component when implementing security features, and what group does this option belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The "secure" option in the Apache Camel NATS component when implementing security features has a default value of false, is a boolean data type, and is not required. This option belongs to the "security" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and configuration method for the Apache Camel component NATS''s option named "sslContextParameters," and is it required when working with this option?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel NATS component''s "sslContextParameters" option serves the purpose of configuring security using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) context parameters when interacting with NATS servers. Although its use is not mandatory, it enables a more secure communication channel between your application and the NATS server by employing SSL encryption. You can set the SSL context parameters as an object within the configuration. For example:              ```javascript       natsComponent().sslContextParameters(Contexts.getSSL().createSSLContext())       ```              Here, `Contexts.getSSL().createSSLContext()` initializes a new SSL context using BouncyCastle provider by default and sets the trust manager and key manager accordingly, as specified in your application. By configuring the "sslContextParameters" option, you can strengthen your connection to NATS servers for better security.'
