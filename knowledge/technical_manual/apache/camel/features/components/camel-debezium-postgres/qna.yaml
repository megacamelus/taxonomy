    - question: 'What are the use cases and available options for setting additional properties in the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component, specifically focusing on how to configure Kafka Connect properties necessary for Debezium engine, such as setting KafkaOffsetBackingStore or schema registry URL?'
      answer: |
       'The "debezium-postgres" component in Apache Camel allows you to set additional properties that cannot be configured directly on the Camel configurations. This comes in handy when configuring Kafka Connect properties required by the Debezium engine, such as setting KafkaOffsetBackingStore or schema registry URL. To do this, you should prefix the property names with "additionalProperties." For instance, to set KafkaOffsetBackingStore, you would use "additionalProperties.transactional.id" and for schema registry URL, "additionalProperties.schema.registry.url". In your case, you can set these properties as follows: additionalProperties.transactional.id=12345 & additionalProperties.schema.registry.url=http://localhost:8811/avro. Keep in mind that these properties are optional and their default values are null. This group of properties belongs to the "common" category.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres" affect error handling, and under what circumstances is it possible to use this feature compared to the default exception handling?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres" allows exceptions that occur while the consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages to be treated as regular messages and handled by the Camel routing Error Handler. This is only possible if the third-party component (in this case, Debezium) allows Camel to be informed about any exceptions thrown. If the component handles exceptions internally, `bridgeErrorHandler` will not be applicable. By default, exceptions are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored, but with `bridgeErrorHandler`, they can be processed as messages. This feature may become available in future releases for other components if they are designed to support this integration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "configuration" option in the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component, and is it required for the consumer group when using this component? Additionally, can you specify the type of data that this option accepts and provide any default value if one exists.'
      answer: |
       'The "configuration" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component allows you to pre-configure various settings for the component. While it is not required for the consumer group when using this component, setting configurations can help fine-tune its behavior according to specific use cases. This option accepts an object type of data, which can be customized based on your needs, and does not have a default value by default.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "internalKeyConverter" option in the Apache Camel''s Debezium-Postgres component and what class should be used as its default value if no custom converter is provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "internalKeyConverter" option in the Apache Camel''s Debezium-Postgres component is utilized to control the serialization and deserialization of key data for offset management. When no custom converter is specified, the default Converter class is org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter. This means that the key data will be converted into JSON format for storage and retrieval of Kafka offsets.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "internalValueConverter" option in the Apache Camel''s Debezium-Postgres component, and what is its default value when not explicitly set? Also, can this option be considered as a required configuration, and where does it belong in terms of consumer settings?'
      answer: |
       'The "internalValueConverter" option in Apache Camel''s Debezium-Postgres component is utilized to specify the Converter class responsible for converting value data related to offsets into serializable format (during serialization) and back to original data (during deserialization). By default, this option uses org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter, which serialize/deserializes data in JSON format. This option is not mandatory to set as it has a default value, but it can be overridden if desired. In terms of consumer settings, it falls under the "consumer" group.'
    - question: 'What are the possible values for the offsetCommitPolicy option in the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component, and can it be set to a custom Java class that implements OffsetCommitPolicy interface? Also, what is the default value for this option if not explicitly specified, and which group of configuration options does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The `offsetCommitPolicy` option in the Apache Camel Debezium-PostgreSQL component can be assigned a string value that represents the name of a Java class implementing the ''OffsetCommitPolicy'' interface. This allows you to customize when offset commits are triggered based on event processing and time elapsed since the last commit. The default value for this option is null, meaning it uses a periodic commit policy based upon time intervals as its default behavior. This configuration option belongs to the "consumer" group. If you wish to set it to a custom Java class, ensure it''s compliant with the OffsetCommitPolicy interface requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum duration (in milliseconds) that the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component will wait for records to be flushed and committed to offset storage when the offsetCommitTimeoutMs option is set, and what is its default value if this option is not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The maximum duration that the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component waits for records to be flushed and committed to offset storage when the `offsetCommitTimeoutMs` option is set is defined in milliseconds, with a maximum of 5000 milliseconds (or 5 seconds) by default. If this option is not specified, it will use the default value provided.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the `offsetFlushIntervalMs` option in the Apache Camel Debezium Postgres component, and is it a required configuration? Also, what type of data is accepted for this option and which group does it belong to within the consumer settings?'
      answer: |
       'The `offsetFlushIntervalMs` option in the Apache Camel Debezium PostgreSQL component determines the interval at which to attempt committing offsets. By default, it''s set to 60 seconds (1 minute). This option is not required as setting it to false disables the flushing of offsets. The type of data accepted for this option is a duration, and it belongs to the consumer group within the component settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default Java class used for persisting Debezium Postgres connector offsets in Apache Camel, and can this be customized if not required?'
      answer: |
       'The default Java class used for persisting Debezium Postgres connector offsets in Apache Camel is org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.FileOffsetBackingStore. If it''s not required, this can be customized as the ''offsetStorage'' option accepts a string value for the name of the Java class responsible for persistence of connector offsets.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "offsetStorageFileName" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component, and what value should it be set to when using the FileOffsetBackingStore for offset storage?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageFileName" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-PostgreSQL component is utilized when choosing the FileOffsetBackingStore for offset storage. This option specifies the path to a file where the offset data will be stored. If you decide to use the FileOffsetBackingStore, it''s recommended to set "offsetStorageFileName" to the desired file path accordingly.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "offsetStoragePartitions" option in the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component, and when is it required to be set? Is this related to the consumer group settings?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStoragePartitions" option in the Apache Camel Debezium PostgreSQL component is used to specify the number of partitions when creating the offset storage topic. This option becomes necessary when the offset.storage setting is set to ''KafkaOffsetBackingStore''. It''s an optional parameter, meaning it doesn''t have a default value. The choice and value of partitions are relevant to consumer-related settings, specifically for managing consumption offsets across a Kafka cluster. However, it does not directly control the behavior or configuration of the consumer group itself.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "offsetStorageReplicationFactor" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component, and is it required when using offset.storage?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageReplicationFactor" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component determines the replication factor used when creating the offset storage topic. This value is relevant only if you set your offset.storage to KafkaOffsetBackingStore. Its default value is null, which means it''s not required but can be explicitly provided to configure the number of replicas for fault tolerance in a Kafka cluster. The group associated with this option is "consumer".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "offsetStorageTopic" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component, and is it required if the offset.storage configuration is set to KafkaOffsetBackingStore? Also, can you explain when this option might be useful in a Kafka streaming application?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageTopic" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component is used to specify the name of the Kafka topic where offsets are stored. This is necessary when the `offset.storage` configuration is set to KafkaOffsetBackingStore. By default, it has no predefined value and can be set as a string. However, its usage is optional as the system can still function without explicitly setting it if another suitable topic for offset storage is configured elsewhere.              In a Kafka streaming application, this option might be useful when you want to persist and manage your offsets within the Kafka ecosystem itself using the KafkaOffsetBackingStore. This can help in managing the position of consumers across restarts or failures, ensuring consistent processing of data in case of reprocessing or error recovery. It also enables easier integration with other Kafka-based applications that require offset management and monitoring.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and purpose of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres", and when might it be useful to set this option to false?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres" determines whether autowiring is enabled for automatic configuration of various components like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. By default, this option is set to true, which means that if a matching type can be found in the registry, it will be automatically configured on the component.              Setting this option to false might be useful when you want to explicitly configure the "debezium-postgres" component without using automatic autowiring. For instance, if you have specific settings for your database connection or if you don''t want Camel to search for a matching type in the registry, setting "autowiredEnabled" to false will allow you to manually configure these options according to your requirements.'
    - question: 'What are the available options for the Apaches Camel Debezium-Postgres component''s "binaryHandlingMode" option and how does each option represent binary data in change events (e.g., ''bytes'', ''base64'', ''base64-url-safe'', or ''hex'')? Additionally, what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "binaryHandlingMode" option for the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component allows you to specify how binary columns (such as blob, binary, etc.) should be represented in change events. There are four available options: ''bytes'' (default), which represents binary data as a byte array; ''base64'', which represents binary data as a base64-encoded string; ''base64-url-safe'', which represents binary data as a base64-url-safe-encoded string; and ''hex'', which represents binary data as a hex-encoded (base16) string. The default value for this option is ''bytes''.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, required status, and possible group of the option "columnExcludeList" in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-postgres''?'
      answer: |
       'The option "columnExcludeList" in the Apache Camel ''debezium-postgres'' component is intended to exclude specific columns from generating change events. It uses regular expressions for this purpose. By default, it does not have a value assigned (defaultValue: null). Its data type is string. The "required" status is false, meaning you can use the ''debezium-postgres'' component without providing a value for this option if desired. This option falls under the group "postgres".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, required status, and available groups of the option "columnIncludeList" in the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component, and can it accept regular expressions for specifying columns to include in change events?'
      answer: |
       'The option "columnIncludeList" in the Apache Camel Debezium Postgres component is used for specifying columns to include in change events by means of regular expressions. Its default value is null, meaning that all columns will be included if not explicitly specified. It has a data type of string and is not a mandatory parameter, as its usage is optional. The available groups for this option are those under the "postgres" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "columnPropagateSourceType" option in the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component, and can it be considered as a required configuration? Also, how should a regular expression pattern be formulated for this option to specify which columns'' original type and length will be propagated in the generated change records?'
      answer: |
       'The "columnPropagateSourceType" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component is designed to propagate the original data type and length of specified columns in the emitted change records. This is done by providing a comma-separated list of regular expressions matching fully-qualified names of these columns. By default, it has no value ("defaultValue": null). It is not a required configuration as denoted by the "required": false property.              A regular expression pattern for this option should be formulated to precisely match the column names in your Postgres database. For example, if you want to propagate the original type and length of columns with names starting with ''mytable.'', you could use the following pattern: ''mytable\..+'' (where ''\.'' is an escaped period character).'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and configuration details for the optional ''converters'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component, and what is the default value and group it belongs to?'
      answer: |
       'The ''converters'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium Postgres component is an optional setting that allows you to use custom converters instead of the default ones. These custom converters can be defined using the ''.type'' configuration option and configured utilizing options starting with a dot (e.g., ''.''). By using custom converters, you can tailor data transformations according to your specific needs. The default value for this option is null, indicating that no custom converters are set initially. This configuration group belongs to the ''postgres'' category in the Apache Camel component configuration.'
    - question: 'How can I configure custom metric tags in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres" to customize the MBean object name, and what is the format for specifying different tags and their corresponding values?'
      answer: |
       'To customize the MBean object name in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres", you can configure the "customMetricTags" option. This feature accepts key-value pairs where each key represents a tag for the MBean object name, and the corresponding value is the value of that tag. The format for specifying different tags and their values is in the form of k1=v1,k2=v2, where k1 and k2 are the keys (tags), and v1 and v2 are their respective values. For example, if you want to set two custom tags, one with key "env" and value "prod", and another with key "region" and value "us-east-1", the configuration would be "env=prod,region=us-east-1". Please note that this option is not mandatory (required: false) in the setup.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "databaseDbname" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres", and is it required for configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseDbname" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres" specifies the name of the database from which the connector should capture changes. Its default value is null, meaning that you need to provide a value during configuration. This option is not required, but it''s strongly recommended for proper functioning as it determines the source database for data changes monitoring.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value, if any, for the "databaseHostname" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-postgres" component, and is it a required configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseHostname" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-postgres" component is designed to specify the resolvable hostname or IP address of the database server where your PostgreSQL instance resides. This value is optional, meaning it''s not required for the component to function if you provide other means for connecting to the database. The default value for this option is null, indicating no predefined value.'
    - question: 'How can you utilize the `databaseInitialStatements` option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component, and what is its purpose when connecting to a PostgreSQL database? Is it necessary for configuration of session parameters, and can it be used for executing DML statements? Also, how should you handle using a semicolon as a character rather than a delimiter in this option''s value?'
      answer: |
       'The `databaseInitialStatements` option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component allows you to specify a list of SQL statements that will be executed when a JDBC connection to the PostgreSQL database is established. This option is typically used for configuring session parameters, such as setting time zones or character sets, but should not be used for executing DML statements (Data Manipulation Language) like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc., due to the connector possibly establishing JDBC connections at its own discretion.       If you need to use a semicolon as a character rather than a delimiter in this option''s value, you can do so by using a doubled semicolon (`;;`) to escape it. For example: `databaseInitialStatements=SET timezone=''UTC'';;`'
    - question: 'What is the required string value for the "databasePassword" option in the Apache Camel''s Debezium-PostgreSQL component, and why is it marked as a required field?'
      answer: |
       'The "databasePassword" option in Apache Camel''s Debezium-PostgreSQL component is a required string value that represents the password of the database user to be used when connecting to the database. This information is mandatory because it enables secure authentication, allowing the Debezium-PostgreSQL component to access your PostgreSQL database and perform changes based on the connected tables'' schema evolution events.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the optional Apache Camel component `debezium-postgres` option named `databasePort`, and what group does this option belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional Apache Camel component `debezium-postgres` option named `databasePort` is an integer type 5432, and it belongs to the `postgres` group.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible maximum (if any) for the "databaseQueryTimeoutMs" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres", and does it require a value to be set if not provided?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "databaseQueryTimeoutMs" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres" is 10 minutes (10m), which translates to 600,000 milliseconds. If not provided, it''s optional and can be left empty, but if a value is set, it must be a duration in milliseconds. There is no explicitly stated maximum limit for this option.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "databaseSslcert" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component, and is it required when using this component? Also, where can one find additional information about using SSL certificates with PostgreSQL when working with this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseSslcert" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component is intended for providing an SSL Certificate for the client. This option is used to ensure secure communication between your application and the PostgreSQL database. It''s important to note that this file contains the SSL certificate for the client-side, as opposed to the server-side certificate (databaseSslkey). The default value for this option is null, meaning it isn''t set by default. However, its use is not mandatory; you can choose whether or not to include it in your configuration based on your security requirements.              For further information about using SSL certificates with PostgreSQL when working with the "databaseSslcert" option, I would recommend referring to the official Postgres SSL documentation. The group associated with this option is "postgres", which signifies that it''s primarily relevant when working with PostgreSQL databases in an Apache Camel context.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the debezium-postgres component''s databaseSslfactory option in Apache Camel to disable SSL validation in a development environment? Is there a specific class name to use for this purpose, as mentioned in the provided information?'
      answer: |
       'To disable SSL validation in a development environment for the debezium-postgres component in Apache Camel, you can set the "databaseSslfactory" option to the specific class name `org.postgresql.ssl.NonValidatingFactory`. This class disables SSL validation, which is useful when working in development environments. Please ensure that this setting is configured appropriately for your production environment to maintain security.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "databaseSslkey" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component, and is it required when using this component? Also, where can further information be found about using an SSL private key with PostgreSQL when working with this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseSslkey" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component is designed to provide a file containing the SSL private key for the client. This option is used when you want to establish a secure connection using SSL with your PostgreSQL database. However, it''s not a required option as you can also use the component without SSL. The default value for this option is null.              For further information about using an SSL private key with PostgreSQL when working with this component, I would recommend referring to the Postgres SSL documentation. These resources will provide detailed instructions and best practices on setting up SSL connections between your application and the PostgreSQL server.'
    - question: 'What are the different values for the Apache Camel debezium-postgres option "databaseSslmode" and what does each value represent in terms of using an encrypted connection to Postgres, including the default value, and how are they affected by the requirement to verify the server TLS certificate against a Certificate Authority (CA)?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres option "databaseSslmode" allows you to specify how an encrypted connection is used with Postgres. Here are the different values you can use:              1. ''disable'' (default): This will use an unencrypted connection.       2. ''allow'': The component will attempt to use an unencrypted connection first, but if that fails, it will try a secure (encrypted) connection.       3. ''prefer'': Similarly to ''allow'', this option attempts to use a secure (encrypted) connection first. However, if that fails, it will fall back to an unencrypted connection.       4. ''require'': This option will only use a secure (encrypted) connection and fail the connection attempt if one cannot be established.       5. ''verify-ca'': This is like ''required'' but it also verifies the server TLS certificate against the configured Certificate Authority (CA) certificates, failing the connection attempt if no valid matching CA certificates are found.       6. ''verify-full'': Similar to ''verify-ca'', this option additionally ensures that the server certificate matches the host to which the connection is attempted.              In summary, you can set the "databaseSslmode" option to use an encrypted connection with Postgres, and you can also choose to require or verify the server TLS certificate against a Certificate Authority (CA) to ensure secure connections.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "databaseSslpassword" option in the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseSslpassword" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Postgres component is used to provide the password that grants access to the client private key from the file specified by ''database.sslkey''. This is essential for SSL communication with your PostgreSQL database. However, it''s important to note that this option has no default value and its usage is optional, meaning you can use this component with or without providing a password if SSL key access is not required in your specific setup.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "databaseSslrootcert" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-PostgreSQL component, whether it''s required, its default value, and where to find more information about its use with PostgreSQL JDBC SSL?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseSslrootcert" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-PostgreSQL component is used to specify a file containing the root certificate(s) against which the PostgreSQL server''s identity is validated during SSL/TLS connections. This option is not mandatory, as it has a default value of null. If provided, it should be a string path to the certificates file. For comprehensive information regarding its use with PostgreSQL JDBC SSL, you may refer to the relevant documentation provided in the Postgres JDBC SSL docs.'
    - question: 'What is the default setting for the "databaseTcpkeepalive" option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-postgres'', and can it be left as its default value when configuring this component, given that it is an optional feature?'
      answer: |
       'The default setting for the "databaseTcpkeepalive" option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-postgres'' is true. Since it is an optional feature, you can leave it as its default value when configuring this component if you wish to enable TCP keep-alive probes to avoid dropping TCP connections.'
    - question: 'What is the optional string parameter in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres" named, and what purpose does it serve when connecting to a PostgreSQL database? Include the default value and data type of this option.'
      answer: |
       'The optional string parameter in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres" is named "databaseUser". This parameter serves to specify the name of the user account that will be used when connecting to a PostgreSQL database. By default, no specific user is set ("defaultValue": null), but when provided, it should be in string format ("type":"string"). It falls under the "postgres" group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "datatypePropagateSourceType" option in the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component, and is it required for usage? Also, can you provide an example of how to use a regular expression with this option to propagate source type and length for a specific database data type?'
      answer: |
       'The "datatypePropagateSourceType" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component is used to add the original data type''s name and length as parameters to the corresponding field schemas in emitted change records, based on a list of provided regular expressions that match specific database-specific data types. The default value for this option is null, meaning it is not required for usage but can be set if desired.              To use a regular expression with this option, you would provide a comma-separated list of patterns in the string value. For example, if you want to propagate the source type and length for the Postgres data type "integer", you could set the option as follows: "datatypePropagateSourceType=integer". This will ensure that each change record emitted by the Debezium-Postgres component includes the original data type ("integer") and its length in the corresponding field schema.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `decimalHandlingMode` option in the Apache Camel component Debezium-PostgreSQL affect the representation of DECIMAL and NUMERIC columns in change events, and what are the available options for this setting?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `decimalHandlingMode` option in the Apache Camel component Debezium-PostgreSQL mainly determines how DECIMAL and NUMERIC columns are represented in change events. The available options are ''precise'' (default), ''string'', and ''double''.              The ''precise'' mode uses java.math.BigDecimal to represent values, which are encoded in the change events using a binary representation and Kafka Connect''s ''org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Decimal'' type. This offers high precision but might require more processing power.              In contrast, the ''string'' mode represents values using strings, providing less overhead for processing but potentially losing some precision. The ''double'' mode represents values using Java''s ''double'', which may not offer the same level of precision as other modes, but will be easier to use in consumers due to its simplicity and lower computational requirements.              You can set this option according to your preference or system requirements; it is not required, but if you do choose to set it, simply specify the desired mode when configuring the Debezium-PostgreSQL component.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible range for the option "errorsMaxRetries" in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres", and is it a required or optional configuration parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the option "errorsMaxRetries" in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres" is set to -1, which means there is no limit on retries when connection errors occur. It can also be disabled by setting it to 0 or set a specific number of retries you prefer. This configuration parameter is optional as indicated by the "required": false in the information provided.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior for handling failures during the processing of events in Apache Camel''s debezium-postgres component, and what are the alternative modes available to handle such failures, along with a brief description of each mode?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for handling failures during event processing in Apache Camel''s debezium-postgres component is ''fail''. When an issue arises while processing events, such as encountering a corrupted event, an exception will be raised that indicates the problematic event and its position. This action results in the connector being stopped.              Alternatively, you can choose two other modes to handle such failures: ''warn'' and ''ignore''. The ''warn'' mode logs the problematic event and its position, skips it without raising an exception, and allows the connector to continue processing events. On the other hand, in the ''ignore'' mode, the connector will skip the problematic event entirely without any logging or raised exceptions.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and purpose of the "flushLsnSource" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres"? Is it required, and how can its value be manually set if needed?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the "flushLsnSource" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres" is to be set to true. This option determines whether Debezium should flush the Log Sequence Number (LSN) in the source PostgreSQL database. If it''s set to false, you would need to manually flush the LSN outside of Debezium. It''s not a required setting, but if you wish to change its value manually, you can do so as it accepts boolean values. The group for this option is "postgres".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "heartbeatActionQuery" option in the Apache Camel''s debezium-postgres component, and is there a default value for this option? Also, can you explain when this query would be executed in the context of using this component for change data capture from a PostgreSQL database?'
      answer: |
       'The "heartbeatActionQuery" option within Apache Camel''s debezium-postgres component serves as a user-defined query that gets executed with every heartbeat. This feature allows you to periodically check the health of your PostgreSQL database, or perform other custom operations. It is important to note that this option does not have a default value and its execution is optional, meaning it can be set to null if no specific action is required during heartbeats. In the context of change data capture (CDC) from a PostgreSQL database, the "heartbeatActionQuery" would be executed during the heartbeat interval, which helps verify the status of the database and ensures smooth operation of the CDC process.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "heartbeatIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres", what is its default value, and is it required or optional to configure?'
      answer: |
       'The "heartbeatIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres" is an interval in milliseconds for which the connector sends periodic heartbeat messages to a heartbeat topic. This feature ensures that the Kafka broker is aware of the connector''s status and can take appropriate action if it stops responding.

      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres", the option "incrementalSnapshotWatermarkingStrategy" can have two values: ''insert_insert'' (default) and ''insert_delete''. The ''insert_insert'' strategy writes both open and close signals into the signal data collection, meaning that both the start and end of a data change event are recorded. On the other hand, the ''insert_delete'' strategy only writes the open signal on the signal data collection, and the close is represented by subsequently deleting the related open signal from the data collection. This difference affects how you manage the lifecycle of your events in an incremental snapshot process with Debezium-Postgres.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible alternatives for the ''intervalHandlingMode'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component, and what does each option represent in terms of how INTERVAL values are represented in change events?'
      answer: |

    - question: 'What are the possible values and their functionalities for the ''schemaRefreshMode'' option within the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component, and how does each mode affect the performance of the connector when dealing with frequently-updated tables that have TOASTed data?'
      answer: |
       'The ''schemaRefreshMode'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component can take two values: ''columns_diff'' (the default) and ''columns_diff_exclude_unchanged_toast''.              The ''columns_diff'' mode ensures that the in-memory schema stays in sync with the database table''s schema at all times. This is the safest mode, as it minimizes the risk of any discrepancy between the in-memory schema and the actual database table schema.              On the other hand, ''columns_diff_exclude_unchanged_toast'' instructs the connector to refresh the in-memory schema cache if there is a discrepancy between it and the schema derived from the incoming message, unless unchanged TOASTable data fully accounts for the discrepancy. This setting can significantly improve connector performance when dealing with frequently-updated tables that have TOASTed data, which are rarely part of these updates. However, it''s important to note that using this mode increases the risk of the in-memory schema becoming outdated if TOASTable columns are dropped from the table.              In summary, each ''schemaRefreshMode'' value has its pros and cons regarding connector performance and data consistency when dealing with frequently-updated tables that have TOASTed data. You should choose the mode based on your specific use case and the trade-off between performance and data consistency that you are comfortable with.'

    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''snapshotLockingMode'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component, and what are the available values for this option? Additionally, how do the different options affect the way the connector holds locks on tables during the schema snapshot process?'
      answer: |
       'The ''snapshotLockingMode'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component is designed to control how the connector handles locks on tables during the schema snapshot process. It has two available values: ''shared'' and ''none''. When set to ''shared'', the connector will only hold a table lock for an initial portion of the snapshot, allowing other concurrent transactions to read from the tables. This is useful for reading database schemas and other metadata as it does not require exclusive access. However, the rest of the snapshot process (i.e., selecting all rows from each table) is performed using a flashback query that doesn''t need locks.              On the other hand, setting ''snapshotLockingMode'' to ''none'' prevents the connector from holding any locks during the snapshot process. This mode can be beneficial if you want to avoid locks entirely, but it should only be used when no schema changes are happening while the snapshot is taken because it does not guarantee consistency if other operations are modifying the database simultaneously.              In summary, the ''snapshotLockingMode'' option allows you to manage locking behavior during the snapshot process in Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component, enabling you to choose between a shared lock (which minimally impacts other transactions) or no locks (which may cause inconsistencies if schema changes are concurrently happening).'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''snapshotLockingModeCustomName'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component, how should it be configured if used, and what type of value is expected for this configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The ''snapshotLockingModeCustomName'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium Postgres component is utilized when you want to customize the locking mode during schema snapshot. If you set ''snapshot.locking.mode'' as ''custom'', you must configure this setting to specify the name of your custom implementation that implements the ''SnapshotterLocking'' interface. This custom implementation is then called to determine the manner in which tables are locked during a schema snapshot. The expected value for this configuration is a string representing the name of your custom implementation. However, it is important to note that setting this option to a specific value is optional as it can be left unset if the default behavior suffices. This configuration falls under the ''postgres'' group of options.'

       'The default value for the "snapshotLockTimeoutMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component is 10 seconds (10s). However, specifying this option during configuration is not mandatory as it has a maximum duration of up to any valid positive integer representing milliseconds. This setting controls the maximum number of milliseconds the component will wait for table locks at the beginning of a snapshot, and if locks cannot be acquired within this time frame, the snapshot will be aborted.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and maximum allowable range for the "snapshotMaxThreads" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-postgres" component, if it is not specified during configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "snapshotMaxThreads" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-postgres" component is 1. However, you can specify a different integer value within the allowable range if desired, though the specific maximum allowable range has not been explicitly stated in this information.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the snapshotMode option in the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component and what are the alternatives for this setting, including the custom snapshot option?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the snapshotMode option in the Apache Camel Debezium PostgreSQL component is ''initial''. This means that if no offsets are detected upon startup, a snapshot will be taken to capture the current full state of the configured tables. After the snapshot completes, the connector begins streaming changes from the transaction log.              Alternative options for this setting include:       1. ''always'': A snapshot is run every time the connector starts, followed by streaming changes from the transaction log.       2. ''initial_only'': The connector performs a snapshot as it does for the ''initial'' option, but stops afterwards and does not stream changes from the transaction log.       3. ''never'': The connector does not run a snapshot and begins reading from the beginning of the transaction log immediately upon startup.       4. ''exported'': This option is deprecated and should be replaced with ''initial''.       5. ''custom'': Allows you to load a custom class to specify how the connector performs snapshots. For more information, see Custom snapshotter SPI in the PostgreSQL connector documentation.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the `snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotData` option in the Apache Camel component `debezium-postgres`, and is it required for configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The `snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotData` option in the Apache Camel component `debezium-postgres` determines when data should be snapshotted, based on whether you set the ''snapshot.mode'' to configuration_based. If not specified, it defaults to false, meaning that data will not be snapped by default. This setting is optional and can be found under the postgres group in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and possible alternative behaviors for the ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnDataError'' option when using the debezium-postgres component in Apache Camel, if this option is not explicitly set? And could you please explain what happens to data snapshotting during error events when this option is set to true or false?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnDataError'' option when using the debezium-postgres component in Apache Camel is that data snapshotting will not occur during error events, as its default value is false. When this option is explicitly set to true, data snapshotting will happen during error events instead of being skipped. This allows you to specify whether the data should be snapshotted or not in case of an error, when ''snapshot.mode'' is configured as configuration_based.'
    - question: '"What is the default behavior and significance of the ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnSchemaError'' option when using the debezium-postgres component in an Apache Camel route, and can it be configured to change this behavior?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnSchemaError'' option within the Debezium-Postgres component, when used in an Apache Camel route, has a default value of false. This option determines whether a schema should be snapshotted or not in case of error when ''snapshot.mode'' is set as configuration_based. If you wish to change this behavior, it can be configured and set to true, enabling control over the schema snapshotting process in the event of errors.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the debezium-postgres component in Apache Camel to determine whether the snapshot schema should be taken based on the configuration when ''snapshot.mode'' is set as ''configuration_based''?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the ''debezium-postgres'' component in Apache Camel so that the snapshot schema is taken based on the configuration when ''snapshot.mode'' is set as ''configuration_based'', you need to set the property "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotSchema" to true. This can be done by adding the following line to your configuration:              ```       debezium-postgres(snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotSchema=true)       ```              This will enable the schema snapshotting based on the specified configuration when ''snapshot.mode'' is set as ''configuration_based''.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedStartStream" option in the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component, and what are its default and possible values? Additionally, is this setting required when using the debezium-postgres component?'
      answer: |
       'The "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedStartStream" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component serves to control whether a stream should start or not after a snapshot, based on the configuration settings of ''snapshot.mode''. If this mode is set as configuration_based, you have the flexibility to decide when the stream should begin post-snapshot.              By default, the value of this option is false. Boolean values are either true or false in this context, with false being the default. This means that if nothing is explicitly specified, the stream will not start after snapshot.              However, it''s important to note that using this setting when working with the debezium-postgres component is optional; it isn''t required for the normal functioning of the component. The ''groups'' field in the configuration specifies that this option pertains to the Postgres group within the Debezium ecosystem.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''snapshotModeCustomName'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component, and under what conditions should it be set if not null? Additionally, what type of data does this option accept and which group of options does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The ''snapshotModeCustomName'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component is designed to specify a custom implementation name for snapshotting when the ''snapshot.mode'' is set to ''custom''. This setting should be used when you want to provide a custom Snapshotter implementation that implements the ''Snapshotter'' interface. The custom Snapshotter will decide whether to perform a snapshot on each app boot. If not set to a specific value, this option does not have a default value.              The data type for this option is a string and it belongs to the ''postgres'' group of options. It should only be set if you wish to use a custom Snapshotter implementation beyond the defaults provided by Debezium-Postgres.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible values for the "snapshotQueryMode" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres", and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option when configuring this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "snapshotQueryMode" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres" is "select_all". This option controls the query used during the snapshot, meaning it determines how data is initially loaded into your system when using Debezium with PostgreSQL. Possible values include "select_all", which loads all data as a single snapshot, and other custom queries if you wish to specify a specific one. Providing a value for this option is not mandatory, but setting a custom query may be necessary in some use cases to optimize the initial load or to control what data gets loaded based on certain conditions.'
    - question: 'What should be the value or type of a custom implementation name for the ''snapshotQueryModeCustomName'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component, if we want to provide our own implementation for determining how to build snapshot queries during snapshot mode? The custom implementation must implement the ''SnapshotterQuery'' interface.'
      answer: |
       'To provide a custom implementation for the ''snapshotQueryModeCustomName'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component, the value or type of the custom implementation name should be a string that specifies the name of your custom implementation. This name must match what is returned by the ''name()'' method in your custom implementation class, which implements the ''SnapshotterQuery'' interface and determines how to build snapshot queries during snapshot mode.'
    - question: 'How can I specify custom SQL queries for individual tables during snapshotting when using the debezium-postgres component in Apache Camel, and what is the purpose of the ''snapshotSelectStatementOverrides'' option for this functionality?'
      answer: |
       'To specify custom SQL queries for individual tables during snapshotting when using the `debezium-postgres` component in Apache Camel, you can make use of the `snapshotSelectStatementOverrides` option. This property allows you to define a comma-separated list of fully-qualified table names (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME or SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME) for which custom select statements are configured.              For each specified table, further configuration properties are required. These are identified by the id ''snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME'' or ''snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME'', respectively. The value of these properties is the custom select statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting.              A practical application for large append-only tables is setting a specific point to start (resume) snapshotting in case a previous snapshotting was interrupted. Keep in mind that the `snapshotSelectStatementOverrides` option has a default value of null and is considered optional within the ''postgres'' group of options.'
    - question: 'How can you customize the order in which tables are processed during the initial snapshot when using the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component, and what are the available options for this configuration?'
      answer: |
       'To customize the order in which tables are processed during the initial snapshot when using the Apache Camel Debezium-PostgreSQL component, you can configure the "snapshotTablesOrderByRowCount" option. This setting controls the sorting of tables based on their row count. If you set it to "descending", tables will be ordered by descending row count. Alternatively, you can use "ascending" for ascending order. Leaving it as its default value, "disabled", means that ordering by row count will not be applied. This configuration falls under the "postgres" group.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "sourceinfoStructMaker" option in the Apache Camel `debezium-postgres` component, and is it mandatory to provide a custom implementation of this option when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "sourceinfoStructMaker" option in the Apache Camel `debezium-postgres` component is io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresSourceInfoStructMaker, and it is not mandatory to provide a custom implementation of this option when using this component as it has a default value provided by Debezium itself.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible range (if applicable) for the `statusUpdateIntervalMs` option within the Apache Camel component `debezium-postgres`, and can it be set as a required configuration parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The `statusUpdateIntervalMs` option in the Apache Camel component `debezium-postgres` has a default value of 10 seconds (or 10,000 milliseconds). This option determines the frequency for sending replication connection status updates to the server. While it''s not required, you can configure it if needed. The possible range for this duration is flexible, though keep in mind that smaller intervals might increase network traffic.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "streamingDelayMs" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres", and what unit of measurement does it use? Is it required or optional, and which group does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "streamingDelayMs" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres" is 0 milliseconds (ms). It specifies a delay period after the snapshot is completed and the streaming begins. This option uses the duration data type, making it optional as indicated by the "required": false property. The group to which it belongs is "postgres".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the tableExcludeList option in the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "tableExcludeList" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Postgres component allows you to specify a comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of tables to be excluded from monitoring. This means, if you want to exclude certain tables from being monitored using this component, you can do so by providing the table names in the specified format. The default value for this option is null, meaning there are no tables excluded initially. Lastly, it''s an optional setting as indicated by "required": false.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel Debezium PostgreSQL component so that it ignores built-in tables during data replication? Given that the ''tableIgnoreBuiltin'' option is a boolean flag, do I need to set it explicitly since its default value is true? If setting it false would make the component consider built-in tables for data replication, what should be done if you want to exclude them?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel Debezium PostgreSQL component to ignore built-in tables during data replication, you can leave the ''tableIgnoreBuiltin'' option as its default value, which is true. Since built-in tables are ignored by default, no explicit setting is required if you want to exclude them from data replication. However, if you wish to include built-in tables for data replication, you would need to set ''tableIgnoreBuiltin'' to false.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "tableIncludeList" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-postgres" component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "tableIncludeList" option within the Apache Camel "debezium-postgres" component serves to specify the tables for which database changes (like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) will be captured. Its default value is null, meaning all tables in your PostgreSQL database will be included unless explicitly specified otherwise. This option is optional, as you can choose to include only certain tables that are of interest to your use case.'
    - question: 'What are the available options for the timePrecisionMode in the debezium-postgres component of Apache Camel, and what is their respective precision level when using this option? (e.g., ''adaptive'', ''adaptive_time_microseconds'', or ''connect'') Also, what is the default value for the timePrecisionMode option, and can it be configured as required or optional in the component settings?'
      answer: |
       'In the debezium-postgres component of Apache Camel, the available options for the timePrecisionMode are ''adaptive'', ''adaptive_time_microseconds'', and ''connect''. The ''adaptive'' mode bases the precision of time, date, and timestamp values on the database column''s precision. ''adaptive_time_microseconds'' works similarly to ''adaptive'', but TIME fields always use microseconds precision. ''connect'' represents time, date, and timestamp values using Kafka Connect''s built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which uses millisecond precision regardless of the database columns'' precision. The default value for the timePrecisionMode option is ''adaptive'', and it can be configured as optional in the component settings since its use is not required.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and if I want to enable the option that makes Debezium-PostgreSQL emit a tombstone event after a delete operation in Apache Camel, should I set the "tombstonesOnDelete" option to true or false?'
      answer: |

    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the optional configuration parameter named "unavailableValuePlaceholder" in the Apache Camel''s Debezium-Postgres component, and under what circumstances is it used to indicate that the original value is not provided by the database?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional configuration parameter "unavailableValuePlaceholder" in the Apache Camel''s Debezium-Postgres component is a string "__debezium_unavailable_value". This parameter is used to indicate that the original value is not provided by the database, such as when the value has been toasted (i.e., it''s a value which Debezium does not capture). If the specified value starts with ''hex:'', it is expected that the rest of the string represents hexadecimal encoded octets. This parameter belongs to the postgres group of options and is not required for the component to function.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component to fetch the xmin value from the replication slot at a specific interval (in milliseconds), and what is the default value for this option if not explicitly set?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel Debezium Postgres component to fetch the xmin value from the replication slot at a specific interval (in milliseconds), you can adjust the "xminFetchIntervalMs" option. By setting a positive duration value for this option, you allow the component to periodically check the replication slot for the xmin value. For instance, if you want to fetch the xmin every 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds), you would set it as "xminFetchIntervalMs=5000ms".              The default value for this option is 0ms, which disables tracking the xmin. This means that if you do not explicitly set the "xminFetchIntervalMs" option, the component will not fetch the xmin from the replication slot.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "additionalProperties" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres", and how should properties be specified within this option to set Kafka Connect properties needed by the Debezium engine, such as setting KafkaOffsetBackingStore or schema registry URL?'
      answer: |
       'The "additionalProperties" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres" serves a purpose when you need to set extra properties for your Debezium components that cannot be adjusted directly on Camel configurations. These are typically Kafka Connect properties required by the Debezium engine, such as setting KafkaOffsetBackingStore or schema registry URL. To specify these properties within the "additionalProperties" option, you should use a prefix (e.g., additionalProperties.transactional.id=12345 and additionalProperties.schema.registry.url=http://localhost:8811/avro). Please note that by default, this option has no preset value (defaultValue: null).'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of using a custom Converter class with the "internalKeyConverter" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component, and what would be an example of a custom Converter class that could be used to serialize and deserialize key data for offsets in this context?'
      answer: |
       'The "internalKeyConverter" option within the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component allows you to specify a custom Converter class to handle serializing and deserializing key data for offsets. By default, JSON converter is used, but using a custom Converter can be beneficial if your data does not fit the format of the default converter.              For instance, in the context of Debezium-Postgres, you might choose to use a custom Converter class that serializes and deserializes keys as hexadecimal strings, particularly if your application uses hexadecimal representations for its offsets. An example of such a custom Converter could be a HexStringConverter that extends the org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.Converter interface and implements serialize() and deserialize() methods accordingly. This way, you can tailor the behavior of the key data handling to suit your specific application''s requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "internalValueConverter" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component, what is its default value, and whether it is required or optional to set this option when using the Debezium-Postgres consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The "internalValueConverter" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component serves the purpose of specifying a Converter class for serializing and deserializing value data related to offsets. By default, this option uses the JSON converter (org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter), but it can be changed if needed.

    - question: 'What are the valid options for the debezium-postgres component''s offsetCommitPolicy in Apache Camel, and what is the purpose of each option? Additionally, can you explain when the default value will be used and why it might not be necessary to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s debezium-postgres component, the valid options for the offsetCommitPolicy are instances of the Java class that implement the OffsetCommitPolicy interface. This option determines when offset commits should occur based on the number of events processed and the time elapsed since the last commit.              The default value is null, indicating that a periodic commit policy based upon time intervals will be used. This means that offsets will automatically commit at regular intervals. However, you might not necessarily need to provide a value for this option if you are content with using the default periodic commit policy. Providing a custom class implementing OffsetCommitPolicy would only be necessary if you wish to establish more specific rules regarding when the offset commit should occur, such as committing after a certain number of events or after a specific elapsed time.'

    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "exceptionHandler" option in the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component, when using it with a custom ExceptionHandler, and how does its behavior differ if the bridgeErrorHandler is enabled or disabled?'
      answer: |
       'The "exceptionHandler" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Postgres component allows you to utilize a custom ExceptionHandler when consuming data. When this option is employed with a custom ExceptionHandler, it overrides the default behavior of the consumer, which logs exceptions at WARN or ERROR level and ignores them.              However, if the "bridgeErrorHandler" is enabled, the "exceptionHandler" becomes inactive. In this scenario, the Debezium connector will handle errors itself, following the rules defined for bridgeErrorHandler. When "bridgeErrorHandler" is disabled, the default behavior of logging and ignoring exceptions at WARN or ERROR level still applies unless a custom exception handler is provided using the "exceptionHandler" option.'

       'The "provideTransactionMetadata" option in the "debezium-postgres" component of Apache Camel enables the extraction of transaction metadata alongside event counting. By default, this option is set to false. It''s important to note that setting this option as false means transaction metadata will not be included with the events. While it''s not mandatory to set this option when using the "debezium-postgres" component, enabling it can provide additional context for your database change events, which may be useful depending on your specific use case requirements.'
    - question: 'What are the different modes available for the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres" option named "publicationAutocreateMode", and what is the default value, as well as how each mode behaves when it comes to the creation of a publication? Also, could you explain the implications for the user''s privileges in each mode?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres" option named "publicationAutocreateMode" offers three distinct modes for managing publications when streaming changes using pgoutput:              1. DISABLED - In this mode, the connector will not attempt to create a publication at all, expecting that the user has created the publication up-front. If the publication isn''t found upon startup, the connector will throw an exception and stop. The implication for the user is they must manage the creation of publications themselves.              2. ALL_TABLES - When this mode is selected, if no existing publication is found, the connector will create a new publication for all tables. This requires that the configured user has access to those tables. If the publication already exists, it will be used. The user should ensure they have sufficient privileges to create publications.              3. FILTERED - In this mode, if no publication exists, the connector will create a new publication for all tables matching the current filter configuration (as defined by table/database include/exclude list properties). If the publication already exists, it will be used. The user should manage the filter configuration to define which tables they want to monitor and ensure they have sufficient privileges for those tables.              The default value is "ALL_TABLES". In this mode, the connector may create publications with broader access than required, depending on the table/database structure and user permissions. To minimize potential issues, users should carefully manage their filter configurations and ensure that the configured user has appropriate access to the necessary tables.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "publicationName" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres", and is it mandatory for this option to be specified when using this component? Further, can you explain what this option does in terms of streaming changes from a PostgreSQL database plugin?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres", the "publicationName" option is a string type and its default value is ''dbz_publication''. This option is not mandatory, as it can be specified but isn''t required for using this component.

      answer: |
       'The "schemaIncludeList" option within the Apache Camel "debezium-postgres" component is used to specify the schemas for which events should be captured. If you choose to provide a value for this option, it should be a list of database schemas as strings (e.g., "public", "my_custom_schema"). However, providing a value is optional, meaning that by default, all database schemas are included unless explicitly specified otherwise. This setting belongs to the "postgres" group of options.'
    - question: 'What are the available options for adjusting schema names when using the ''debezium-postgres'' component in Apache Camel, and can you explain what each option (schemaNameAdjustmentMode) does when specified? Also, if not set, what is the default value of this option?'
      answer: |
       'When utilizing the ''debezium-postgres'' component in Apache Camel, you have three options for adjusting schema names based on the message converter used by the connector:              1. ''avro'': This mode replaces characters that cannot be used in the Avro type name with underscores (_).              2. ''avro_unicode'': In this mode, underscores (_) or characters not permitted in the Avro type name are replaced using the corresponding Unicode characters like _uxxxx.              3. ''none'': This option does not apply any adjustment and uses the schema names as they are (default value).              If you do not set the schemaNameAdjustmentMode, it will use the default value of ''none''.'
    - question: 'What are the different values available for the ''schemaRefreshMode'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium Postgres component, and can you explain their implications on the in-memory schema cache synchronization and potential impact on connector performance and data consistency?'
      answer: |
       'The ''schemaRefreshMode'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium Postgres component allows you to specify the conditions that trigger a refresh of the in-memory schema for a table. There are two values available: ''columns_diff'' (the default) and ''columns_diff_exclude_unchanged_toast''.              1. ''columns_diff'': This is the safest mode, ensuring the in-memory schema stays in-sync with the database table''s schema at all times. This mode can slightly impact connector performance due to the frequent schema refreshes but guarantees data consistency.              2. ''columns_diff_exclude_unchanged_toast'': By choosing this setting, you instruct the connector to refresh the in-memory schema cache if there is a discrepancy between it and the schema derived from the incoming message, unless unchanged TOASTable data fully accounts for the discrepancy. This can significantly improve connector performance if there are frequently-updated tables that have TOASTed data which are rarely part of these updates. However, it''s important to note that using this setting might lead to an outdated in-memory schema if TOASTable columns are dropped from the table.              In summary, the choice between these two values depends on your specific use case, considering trade-offs between data consistency, connector performance, and potential impacts on the in-memory schema cache synchronization.'

    - question: 'What is the purpose of the option "snapshotLockingMode" in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres", and what are the possible values for this option, along with their implications on table locking during the schema snapshot process?'
      answer: |
       'The "snapshotLockingMode" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres" controls how the connector handles locks on tables while performing the schema snapshot. It has two main values: ''shared'' and ''none''.              When set to ''shared'', the connector will hold a table lock that prevents exclusive table access only for the initial portion of the snapshot, while it reads the database schemas and other metadata. The rest of the work in a snapshot is done using a flashback query that requires no locks. However, if you prefer to avoid locks entirely, you can set it to ''none''.              Please note that using ''none'' mode is only safe when no schema changes are happening during the snapshot process because no locks are held at all in this mode.

      answer: |
       'To configure the `snapshotSelectStatementOverrides` option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component, you specify a comma-separated list of fully-qualified tables (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME or SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME) in this property. For each table, further configuration properties are used, identified by the id ''snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME'' or ''snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME'', respectively. The value of these properties is the select statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting.              The purpose of using this configuration in handling large append-only tables, especially when resuming snapshotting after an interruption, is to set a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting. By defining a custom select statement, you can control exactly which data gets included in the snapshot, allowing you to skip over the rows that were already processed during the previous snapshot. This way, you can efficiently handle large append-only tables without having to process all of them again from the beginning after an interruption.'

The type of this option is "duration". It belongs to the "postgres" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "streamingDelayMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-PostgreSQL component, and what is its default value, data type, and group association?'
      answer: |
       'The "streamingDelayMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-PostgreSQL component serves as a delay period after a snapshot is completed before the streaming begins. This delay is expressed in milliseconds, with a default value of 0 ms. Its data type is duration, and it''s associated within the Postgres group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "tableExcludeList" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "tableExcludeList" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component is an optional configuration with a default value of null. It serves as a comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of tables to be excluded from monitoring within your Postgres database. If no exclusion list is provided, all tables will be monitored for changes.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `tableIgnoreBuiltin` option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres" to false affect table processing, given that its default value is true and it''s an optional boolean configuration?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `tableIgnoreBuiltin` option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres" to false will cause built-in tables (such as information_schema) to be processed during change data capture, contrary to their default behavior where they are ignored. Since this option is optional and its default value is true, leaving it at its default will continue to exclude built-in tables from processing. However, setting it to false allows for the inclusion of these tables in your data flow.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "tableIncludeList" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres", and is it a required setting?'
      answer: |
       'The "tableIncludeList" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres" specifies the tables for which changes are to be captured. Its default value is null, meaning that all tables in the connected PostgreSQL database will be monitored if no specific table list is provided. However, it''s an optional setting, as you can choose to only track changes for certain tables by providing a comma-separated list of table names when using this option.'
    - question: 'What are the possible values for the ''timePrecisionMode'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component and what is their respective behavior in terms of time, date, and timestamp precision when reading data from a PostgreSQL database?'
      answer: |
       'The ''timePrecisionMode'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component can take three values: ''adaptive'' (the default), ''adaptive_time_microseconds'', and ''connect''.              The ''adaptive'' mode bases the precision of time, date, and timestamp values on the database column''s precision. This means that the precision will adapt to the precision defined in your PostgreSQL database columns.              The ''adaptive_time_microseconds'' mode functions similarly to ''adaptive'', but it ensures that TIME fields always use microseconds precision. This could be beneficial if your application requires a higher resolution for time data.              Lastly, the ''connect'' mode always represents time, date, and timestamp values using Kafka Connect''s built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which uses millisecond precision regardless of the database columns'' precision. This could be useful if your application consistently requires millisecond precision for all time data.'
    - question: 'Here is a question that could be asked about the "tombstonesOnDelete" option in the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component:              "When using the ''debezium-postgres'' component in Apache Camel, if I want Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to the given key once the source record gets deleted, should I set the ''tombstonesOnDelete'' option to true or false?"'
      answer: |
       'To fully delete all events associated with a specific key from Kafka after a source record deletion when using the "debezium-postgres" component in Apache Camel, you should set the ''tombstonesOnDelete'' option to true.'
    - question: 'What is the default TopicNamingStrategy class used by the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component when determining the name of topics for data change, schema change, transaction, and heartbeat events, and can this default be overridden in the configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The default TopicNamingStrategy class used by the Apache Camel Debezium-Postgres component when determining the names of topics for data change, schema change, transaction, and heartbeat events is "io.debezium.schema.SchemaTopicNamingStrategy". This default value can be overridden in the configuration if desired.'
    - question: 'What should the structure of the topic prefix be when using the "topicPrefix" option for the Apache Camel component "debezium-postgres", and which characters are allowed in this option according to its description?'
      answer: |
       'The topic prefix for the "debezium-postgres" component, when utilizing the "topicPrefix" option with Apache Camel, should consist of alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-), dots (.), and underscores (_). It is important to note that this prefix serves as a unique identifier across all other connectors, since it precedes all Kafka topic names receiving events emitted by this specific connector. Therefore, ensure the chosen topic prefix is distinct from others to avoid any potential conflicts or confusion in your Kafka environment.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "transactionMetadataFactory" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Postgres component, and is it required to be set explicitly if not provided? (Answer: The default value is io.debezium.pipeline.txmetadata.DefaultTransactionMetadataFactory, and it can be omitted if not specified explicitly.)'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "transactionMetadataFactory" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Postgres component is io.debezium.pipeline.txmetadata.DefaultTransactionMetadataFactory. It''s not necessary to set it explicitly if you don''t wish to, as it has a default value provided.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the optional Debezium-PostgreSQL component setting named "unavailableValuePlaceholder", which allows specifying a constant to indicate that an original value is unavailable in the database, and accepts hexadecimal encoded octets if prefixed with ''hex:''? And, are there any specific groups this option belongs to?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional Debezium-PostgreSQL component setting named "unavailableValuePlaceholder" is a string type value "__debezium_unavailable_value". If the value starts with ''hex:'', it is expected that the rest of the string represents hexadecimal encoded octets. This option belongs to the "postgres" groups.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "xminFetchIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel debezium-postgres component and what are the trade-offs when adjusting its value? Additionally, what is the default value for this option and can it be specified as a required configuration parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The "xminFetchIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Postgres component is used to configure how often (in milliseconds) the transaction ID (xmin) will be fetched from the replication slot. This value provides a lower bound for where a new replication slot could start, ensuring data consistency during replication.              Adjusting this value involves a trade-off between accuracy and performance. A lower value increases the likelihood of having the current ''true'' xmin value (i.e., more accurate), but it comes at a higher performance cost due to increased frequency of xmin fetching. Conversely, a higher value reduces the likelihood of having the current ''true'' xmin value (potentially less accurate) but minimizes the performance penalty because xmin fetching occurs less frequently.              The default value for this option is 0ms, which disables tracking the xmin. This means that the component will not attempt to fetch the transaction ID from the replication slot. Lastly, it can be specified as an optional configuration parameter since providing a value for it is not required in your setup.'
