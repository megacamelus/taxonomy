    - question: 'How does enabling the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel''s platform-http component affect error handling compared to its default behavior, and under what circumstances is it possible for this feature to be used?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in Apache Camel''s platform-http component allows for bridging errors that occur while the consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages, to the Camel routing Error Handler instead of being logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored by default. This feature can be used when the 3rd party component supports notifying Camel if an exception was thrown. However, not all components support this behavior; some handle exceptions internally only, making the "bridgeErrorHandler" option inapplicable for them. If the Camel component is enhanced to interface with the 3rd party component in future releases, this feature can be made available for those components as well.'
    - question: 'How does the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel''s "platform-http" component affect the behavior of automatically configuring options like JDBC data sources or AWS clients, and what is its default value and possible groups where this option can be configured?'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s platform-http component, the "autowiredEnabled" option determines whether autowiring is enabled for automatically configuring options like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, and so forth. When set to true (its default value), it allows the component to look up in the registry for a single instance of a matching type and then configure that instance on the component. This feature streamlines the configuration process by eliminating the need to manually configure these components individually, making it particularly useful for complex systems where multiple such configurations are required. The "autowiredEnabled" option can be found under the "advanced" groups in your Camel configuration settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "engine" option in the advanced settings for Apache Camel''s platform-http component, and is it required?'
      answer: |
       'The "engine" option in Apache Camel''s advanced settings for the platform-http component doesn''t have a default value. This option provides an HTTP Server engine implementation to handle requests served by the component. However, its usage is optional, meaning you can choose not to specify it if you prefer using the default server engine provided by your runtime environment.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom header filtering strategy for the Apache Camel platform-http component using the `headerFilterStrategy` option?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom header filtering strategy for the Apache Camel platform-http component, you can utilize the `headerFilterStrategy` option. Set this option to an instance of org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy in your configuration or route definition that implements the necessary logic for filtering headers to and from the Camel message. If the `headerFilterStrategy` is not explicitly specified, it will not be applied by default, but can still be added at a later time when required within your Camel application or route using the "filter" group configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "consumes" option in the Apache Camel platform-http component and what value should be provided for it to restrict the content type to accept only application/json as input?'
      answer: |
       'The "consumes" option in the Apache Camel platform-http component is used to specify the content type that this endpoint accepts as input. To restrict the content type to accept only application/json as input, you should provide "application/json" as the value for the "consumes" option. Alternatively, if there are no restrictions on the content type, leaving the "consumes" option as null or "/\*" would suffice.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "cookieDomain" option in the Apache Camel platform-http component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "cookieDomain" option within the Apache Camel platform-http component sets which server can receive cookies. Its default value is null, meaning no cookie domain is set if not explicitly provided. It''s important to note that providing a value for this option is not mandatory; it''s optional under the consumer group of settings in the component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "cookieHttpOnly" option in the Apache Camel platform-http component, and is its usage optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'The "cookieHttpOnly" option in the Apache Camel platform-http component serves to determine whether client-side scripts are prohibited from accessing cookies that have been created. Its default value is `false`. Usage of this option is considered optional, not required in your consumer group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "cookieMaxAge" option in the Apache Camel "platform-http" component when it''s not required, if any group is involved?'
      answer: |
       'The "cookieMaxAge" option within the Apache Camel "platform-http" component serves to set the maximum duration (in seconds) that a cookie remains active on the client''s browser. If this option is not provided, it does not have a default value. However, it is worth noting that the "cookieMaxAge" option is optional and only applicable to the consumer group in Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "cookiePath" option within the Apache Camel platform-http component, how should it be formatted, is it required, and can you provide an example of its usage when sending cookies with a consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The "cookiePath" option in the Apache Camel platform-http component determines the URL path that must appear in the requested URL for the server to send the Cookie. It is formatted as a string, but it defaults to "/". Using this option is optional, meaning you can still send cookies without explicitly setting it. For instance, when sending cookies with a consumer, its usage can be demonstrated as follows:              ```       from("direct:consume")       .to("platform-http://localhost/examplePath?cookiePath=/examplePath/cookieDir&cookies=[simple({"name":"sessionCookie","value":"sessionValue"})]");       ```              In this example, the consumer sends a GET request to "localhost/examplePath", and it includes a cookie named "sessionCookie" with a value of "sessionValue" only when the requested URL contains "/examplePath/cookieDir".'
    - question: 'How can you configure the Apache Camel platform-http component to set a "Strict" sameSite policy for cookies when making HTTP requests? (Currently, it defaults to Lax, and you want to ensure cookies are only sent with top-level navigations to the same domain.)'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel platform-http component to set a "Strict" sameSite policy for cookies when making HTTP requests, you need to adjust the `cookieSameSite` option. Since the current default is Lax, you should update it to Strict. Here''s the modification required in your configuration:              ```java       .setProperty("cookieSameSite", "Strict")       ```              Make sure to apply this change to each platform-http component instance within your routes where you want to enforce the Strict sameSite policy for cookies. This will ensure that cookies are only sent with top-level navigations to the same domain as intended.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and usage of the Apache Camel platform-http option "cookieSecure", and under what conditions can it be marked as required? The option sets whether the cookie is only sent to the server with an encrypted request over HTTPS. Does it have a specific group assignment, and if so, which one(s)?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel platform-http option "cookieSecure" is false. This option determines whether a cookie will be sent to the server only with an encrypted request over HTTPS. It can be marked as required, but by default it''s not. The specific group assignment for this option is "consumer".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel component "platform-http" option named "httpMethodRestrict", and can it be omitted if I want to serve all HTTP methods in a Camel route consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel component "platform-http" option called "httpMethodRestrict" is responsible for specifying a comma-separated list of HTTP methods (e.g., GET,POST) that your route will serve within the context of a Camel consumer. If no methods are specified explicitly, all methods will be served by default. In other words, if you wish to serve all HTTP methods in a Camel route consumer, you can omit this option as its default value is null and all methods will be handled.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel platform-http component so that the consumer attempts to find a target consumer by matching the URI prefix if there''s no exact match for the given URI? Is it possible to set the "matchOnUriPrefix" option to true? And what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'Yes, you can configure the Apache Camel platform-http component to attempt finding a target consumer by matching the URI prefix when no exact match is found. To enable this behavior, you need to set the "matchOnUriPrefix" option to true. This option is of boolean type and its default value is false (meaning it''s disabled). When enabled, it can be found within the ''consumer'' groups during configuration.'
    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the "muteException" option in the Apache Camel platform-http component impact the response''s body when an Exchange fails processing on the consumer side?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "muteException" option in the Apache Camel platform-http component means that if an Exchange fails processing on the consumer side, the response''s body will not contain the exception''s stack trace. If this option is left disabled (its default value is true), the exception details are included in the response.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "produces" option in the Apache Camel "platform-http" component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "produces" option within the Apache Camel "platform-http" component serves the purpose of defining the content type that the endpoint produces, such as application/xml or application/json. However, the default value is not specified, implying it can be left empty or undefined if you prefer. In other words, providing a value for this option is not mandatory.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "useCookieHandler" option in the Apache Camel "platform-http" component, and what groups does it belong to when this feature is not required for use?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "useCookieHandler" option in the Apache Camel "platform-http" component is false, meaning that the Cookie Handler is not enabled by default. This feature belongs to the "consumer" group, which includes components that act as consumers of messages from various sources, including HTTP requests.'
    - question: 'In the context of the Apache Camel platform-http component, what is the default value of the "useStreaming" option and under which conditions is it applicable (as indicated by its description and group information)?'
      answer: |
       'The "useStreaming" option in the Apache Camel platform-http component has a default value of false. It''s applicable for large requests and responses, particularly when streaming is supported, which at present only occurs with camel-platform-http-vertx.'
    - question: 'How does the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel platform-http component work, and when is it not possible to use this feature? Furthermore, what happens by default when bridgeErrorHandler is set to false, and where can you find more information about groups or advanced consumer settings?'
      answer: |
       'The `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel platform-http component allows for bridging any exceptions that may occur while the component is trying to pickup incoming messages to be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. This is only possible if the 3rd party component being used permits Camel to be alerted when an exception was thrown. If the component manages exceptions internally without providing this information, using bridgeErrorHandler is not possible.              By default, when `bridgeErrorHandler` is set to false, exceptions will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. Instead of being handled as messages, they are simply discarded.              The advanced consumer settings can be found under the "consumer (advanced)" group, which provides additional configuration options for working with message consumers in Camel. You can explore more details about these settings by examining the documentation associated with that group.'
    - question: 'What is the function of the Apache Camel "exceptionHandler" option within the "platform-http" component when the "bridgeErrorHandler" is disabled, and how does it interact with the default exception handling if no custom ExceptionHandler is provided?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel "platform-http" component, the "exceptionHandler" option allows users to provide a custom ExceptionHandler when the "bridgeErrorHandler" is disabled. By default, the consumer will handle exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored if no custom ExceptionHandler is provided. If a custom ExceptionHandler is not given, this option does nothing as it is optional. It''s important to note that this feature falls under the advanced group "consumer (advanced)".'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel platform-http component, and can it be configured differently during the creation of an exchange by the consumer, and if so, under which group of options does this configuration belong?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel platform-http component doesn''t have a default behavior. However, it can be configured differently during the creation of an exchange by the consumer. This configuration belongs to the advanced group of options named "consumer (advanced)".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel component "platform-http" option named "fileNameExtWhitelist", and in what groups of users (from consumer to expert) would this configuration option typically be considered?'
      answer: |
       'The purpose of the Apache Camel platform-http component''s fileNameExtWhitelist option is to define a list of file extensions that will allow local storage of uploaded files in a comma or whitespace-separated format. By default, this option has no value (null), meaning that no specific file extensions are allowed for storage. However, an asterisk (*) can be used as a wildcard to permit all files. This configuration option is typically found within the ''consumer (advanced)'' user groups, suggesting it may be more suited to advanced users due to its file management capabilities in handling HTTP platform components.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the Apache Camel''s headerFilterStrategy option within the platform-http component, and what are its default and required values? Is it considered an advanced feature and where can we find more information about customizing this strategy?'
      answer: |
       'The `headerFilterStrategy` option in the Apache Camel''s `platform-http` component is used to apply a custom filter strategy for headers to and from messages. This allows you to selectively include or exclude headers as needed, enhancing control over your message exchanges. By default, it accepts null values, meaning no specific strategy is set if not provided. The `headerFilterStrategy` option is considered an advanced feature, located in the ''advanced'' group, which suggests that its use may require a more experienced understanding of Apache Camel. For detailed information on customizing this strategy, I would recommend consulting the official Apache Camel documentation or guides dedicated to the topic.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the Apache Camel "platformHttpEngine" option within the context of the platform-http component, and is its usage considered mandatory or optional in the configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "platformHttpEngine" option within the Apache Camel''s "platform-http" component is an implementation of an HTTP Server engine to handle requests for this endpoint. By default, it has no predefined value (null), indicating that you can set it according to your needs. Its usage is considered optional as it falls under the "advanced" configuration group in Camel components, which means its inclusion in a configuration is not mandatory but can provide additional features or customization when needed.'
