seed_examples:
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the ''connectTimeout'' option in the Apache Camel Consul component, and can it be omitted if not provided with a specific value?'
      answer: |
       'The ''connectTimeout'' option within the Apache Camel Consul component is responsible for setting the maximum duration for establishing a connection using OkHttpClient before timing out. By default, this value is not defined or null, meaning it doesn''t have a predefined timeout when used without specification. However, it can be set explicitly if you wish to customize the connect timeout. Its usage falls under the ''common'' group of options, which indicates it''s applicable across various scenarios within the Consul component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel consul component option named ''consulClient'', and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The ''consulClient'' option in the Apache Camel Consul component is a reference to an instance of `org.kiwiproject.consul.Consul` within the registry. It is not a required parameter, so its default value is null. When using this Consul component, providing a ''consulClient'' value is optional, but it allows for custom configuration of the Consul client behavior if needed.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel Consul option named "key", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel Consul option named "key" serves as a default key that can be overridden using the CamelConsulKey. Its purpose is to provide a default identifier or reference within the Consul service for retrieving data. However, it''s important to note that this option is not required, meaning you can choose to explicitly specify a different key when using the Consul component if needed. The default value of this option is null.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and is it required to configure the "pingInstance" option in the Apache Camel Consul component, and what groups does this configuration belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the "pingInstance" option in the Apache Camel Consul component is true, meaning that the AgentClient will attempt a ping before returning the Consul instance. However, it''s not required to configure this option as it has a default value. This configuration belongs to the "common" groups.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "readTimeout" option in the Apache Camel Consul component, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "readTimeout" option in the Apache Camel Consul component does not have a default value and its purpose is to set the read timeout for OkHttpClient. This means that it determines the maximum time that the Consul component will wait before timing out when reading data from an API. Whether you need to specify this option depends on your specific use case. If you don''t set it, Camel will use a default value determined by the underlying library, which is usually sufficient for most applications. However, if you have particular requirements around read timeouts in your API interactions, you can use the "readTimeout" option to customize this behavior.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "tags" option in the Apache Camel Consul component, and how are multiple tags separated when using this option? Also, does it have a default value and is it required to be specified?'
      answer: |
       'The "tags" option in the Apache Camel Consul component is designed for setting tags on resources. Multiple tags can be specified by separating them with commas. It does not have a default value, meaning you can choose to set tags or leave them blank if desired. The "tags" option belongs to the common group of options in the component''s configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "url" option in the Apache Camel Consul component, and is it required? (Answer: The "url" option in the Apache Camel Consul component specifies the Consul agent URL. Its default value is null, and it''s not a required field.)'
      answer: |
       'The "url" option within the Apache Camel Consul component defines the Consul agent URL. It''s an optional string field, meaning you can choose to provide this information or not, as its default value is null.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "writeTimeout" option in the Apache Camel Consul component, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "writeTimeout" option in the Apache Camel Consul component does not have a default value. It serves as the write timeout for OkHttpClient, which helps control the duration for writing data to the server before timing out. However, it is not required when using this component; its inclusion depends on specific use cases where controlling write timeouts might be necessary for efficient communication with the server.'
    - question: 'How does the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel Consul component function, and under what conditions is it possible for this feature to be utilized?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel Consul component allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions (if supported by the third-party component) that occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. However, this feature is only possible if the third-party component allows Camel to be notified if an exception was thrown. Some components manage exceptions internally, so bridgeErrorHandler is not applicable in such cases. In situations where the Camel component can be modified to interface with the third-party component, this functionality may become available in future releases. By default, the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, which will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored if bridgeErrorHandler is not enabled.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "action" option in the Apache Camel Consul component, and can it be left empty or must a custom string value be provided when using this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "action" option in the Apache Camel Consul component is designed for specifying a default action, which can be overridden by the CamelConsulAction if required. However, it does not have a default value and can be left empty or provided with a custom string value as per your preference when using this option.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Consul component, and under what circumstances might it be beneficial to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Consul component allows you to control whether the producer should be started immediately during the route''s initialization or delayed until the first message arrives. By setting this option to true, you can prevent the route from failing during startup if a producer may otherwise fail at that time. Instead, any startup failures will be handled by Camel''s routing error handlers while processing messages later on.              However, it is essential to note that when first message processing occurs, creating and starting the producer could take some additional time, which might prolong the overall processing time of the route. This option can be beneficial in situations where a producer may cause issues during startup, but once it''s initialized, it operates smoothly. It provides flexibility in managing exceptions during initialization without impacting the functionality of the entire route upon its successful startup.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior, and if it can be changed, how do you configure the Apache Camel Consul component''s "valueAsString" option to transform values retrieved from Consul to strings? Does setting this option as true or false have any impact on the producer group?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the Apache Camel Consul component is to not transform values retrieved from Consul to strings (as `valueAsString` is set to `false` by default). If you wish to change this behavior, you can configure the "valueAsString" option to true or false according to your requirements. Setting this option to true will cause the component to transform the values to strings, whereas setting it to false will prevent string transformation. Regarding the producer group, changing the value of `valueAsString` does not impact the producer group directly.'
    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Consul component affect the automatic configuration of various services such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc.? And is it necessary to enable this option by default when using the Consul component?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Consul component allows for automatic configuration of various services such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. This is possible because when autowiring is enabled, Camel will look up in the registry to find a single instance of matching type, and then configure that instance on the component. If you choose to disable this option, you would need to manually configure these services yourself. The default value for "autowiredEnabled" is true, meaning it is enabled by default when using the Consul component. However, whether or not you need to keep it enabled depends on your specific use case and whether you prefer manual or automatic configuration for your services.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "configuration" option in the Apache Camel Consul component when using it within an advanced group? Does this option have a required status and what type of data does it accept, as indicated by its properties?'
      answer: |
       'The "configuration" option in the Apache Camel Consul component, when used within an advanced group, serves the purpose of allowing custom configuration settings for Consul. This option does not have a default value (defaultValue: null). It accepts object type data, meaning it can handle complex key-value pairs as its input. The "configuration" option is not required to be provided, indicated by the "required": false property.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the ''consistencyMode'' option in the Apache Camel Consul component, and can it be configured if set as optional? Additionally, what groups does this option belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The ''consistencyMode'' option in the Apache Camel Consul component is a configurable parameter that determines the consistency level for queries made against Consul services. By default, it uses ConsistencyMode.DEFAULT, which provides a balance between performance and data consistency. This option can be configured if set as optional, meaning you can change its value to achieve different levels of consistency depending on your application''s requirements. The ''consistencyMode'' option belongs to the "advanced" groups in the component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "datacenter" option in the Apache Camel Consul component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "datacenter" option in the Apache Camel Consul component is an advanced setting that defines the data center for the service discovery. Its default value is null, meaning it doesn''t have a predefined value. Using this option is not mandatory; you can choose to provide a value for it if your use case requires specific data center communication within the Consul service mesh.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "nearNode" option in the advanced group of the Apache Camel Consul component, if it is not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The "nearNode" option in the Apache Camel Consul component''s advanced group is designed to specify the near node for queries. If it is not provided, it does not have a default value.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "nodeMeta" option in the Apache Camel Consul component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "nodeMeta" option in the Apache Camel Consul component is an array that holds note meta-data for use in queries. It does not have a default value. Whether to provide this information is optional as the setting is labeled as such within the advanced group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel component `consul` option named `aclToken`, and is it required? Also, in which group of options does this choice belong within the context of security settings for the `consul` component?'
      answer: |
       'The Consul component''s ACL token option (`aclToken`) is designed to set the Access Control List (ACL) token for use with Consul. This option allows authentication and authorization when interacting with the Consul service. The default value for this option is null, meaning no ACL token is set by default. However, using an ACL token is not a required setting. Lastly, within the context of security settings for the Consul component, this choice belongs under the "security" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it''s required when using the "password" option in the Apache Camel Consul component for basic authentication?'
      answer: |
       'The "password" option in the Apache Camel Consul component is used for setting the password to be used in basic authentication. Its default value is null, meaning you need to provide a string value for it. The data type of this option is a string, and its usage falls under the security group, indicating it''s relevant to securing your application. However, providing a password is not required, as the option is marked as "required: false".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the Apache Camel Consul option named "sslContextParameters" in terms of SSL configuration when working with the org.apache.camel.support.jsse.SSLContextParameters instance, and is it optional or required? Additionally, could you provide an example of how to set this option for enhanced security in a Camel route?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel Consul option named "sslContextParameters" is utilized for SSL configuration when working with the org.apache.camel.support.jsse.SSLContextParameters instance. This option allows you to set up SSL parameters, such as truststore and keystore locations, for secure communication over HTTPS or other protocols that require SSL/TLS encryption. The use of this option is optional but recommended under the "security" group, enhancing the security of your Camel routes by providing a means to configure SSL settings.              Here''s an example of how to set this option in a Camel route for enhanced security:              ```java       import org.apache.camel.support.jsse.SSLContextParameters;       ...              @Component       public class MyCamelRouteBuilder extends RouteBuilder {           @Override           public void configure() throws Exception {               SSLContextParameters sslContextParameters = new SSLContextParameters();               sslContextParameters.setTruststorePassword("truststore_password");               sslContextParameters.setTruststoreType("JKS");               sslContextParameters.setTruststorePath("path/to/your_truststore.jks");                      SSLContextParameters keyStoreParameters = new SSLContextParameters();               keyStoreParameters.setKeyPassword("keystore_password");               keyStoreParameters.setKeystoreType("JKS");               keyStoreParameters.setKeystorePath("path/to/your_keystore.jks");               keyStoreParameters.setKeyAlias("alias_name");                      sslContextParameters.setKeyManager(keyStoreParameters);                      from("https://example.com").sslContextParameters(sslContextParameters).to("log:debug");           }       }       ```              In this example, the "sslContextParameters" option is used to configure SSL settings for a Camel route that communicates with the `https://example.com` endpoint. The truststore and keystore are provided as paths to JKS files, along with their respective passwords. The key alias is also specified if necessary.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the Apache Camel Consul component''s "useGlobalSslContextParameters" option, which allows for the use of global SSL context parameters in security configuration, affect the behavior of this component when it is set to true or false?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "useGlobalSslContextParameters" option within the Apache Camel Consul component sets whether you utilize global SSL context parameters during your security configuration. When this option is set to true, it allows the component to use those global SSL context parameters across its operations, enhancing consistency and potential reusability of SSL configurations. Conversely, when "useGlobalSslContextParameters" is false, each instance of the Consul component will independently manage its own SSL context parameters, resulting in separate configurations for every operation. This difference primarily impacts the way SSL-related settings are applied and maintained across your security configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, required status, and possible group of the Apache Camel consul component option named "userName", and could you please describe how it can be utilized in basic authentication?'
      answer: |
       'The "userName" option within the Apache Camel Consul component is used to set the username for basic authentication purposes. Its default value is null, meaning no default username is provided. This option is of string data type and can be specified or left unset as it has an optional status. The group to which this option belongs is "security", indicating its relevance in handling secure communication. In basic authentication scenario, you would set a non-null value for the "userName" option to provide the required username when connecting to a Consul service that employs basic authentication.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "blockSeconds" option in the Apache Camel Consul component, and is its use mandatory or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "blockSeconds" option in the Apache Camel Consul component is an integer with a default value of 10. Its data type is integer. The use of this option is optional as indicated by the "required": false in its metadata.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the Apache Camel Consul component''s "firstIndex" option when setting up a watch with this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "firstIndex" option in the Apache Camel Consul component, when establishing a watch, is 0. Its purpose is to specify the initial index from where to start watching for updates within the Consul service. If not provided explicitly, it defaults to starting from the beginning (index 0). This feature allows you to monitor changes in your Consul service efficiently.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `recursive` option to true in the Apache Camel Consul component affect its behavior regarding service discovery and watching services?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `recursive` option to true in the Apache Camel Consul component allows it to perform a recursive watch of the registered services. This means that when enabled, the component will not only monitor the specified service but also any subservices or child services associated with it. In essence, this option deepens the scope of service discovery and watching, providing a more comprehensive view of the service hierarchy within Consul.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the ''connectTimeout'' option in the Apache Camel Consul component, and does it have a default value specified?'
      answer: |
       'The ''connectTimeout'' option in the Apache Camel Consul component is designed to set a timeout for connecting to OkHttpClient. It doesn''t have a default value specified; you may need to provide one according to your application requirements. This option falls under the common group of settings in the Consul component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "consulClient" option in the Apache Camel component named "consul", and is it required? Also, can you provide an example of how this option might be used in a configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "consulClient" option in the Apache Camel component named "consul" serves as a reference to the `org.kiwiproject.consul.Consul` class within the registry. It is an optional parameter, meaning it''s not required for usage. By default, it has no predefined value (`defaultValue`: null).              Here''s an example of how this option might be used in a configuration:              ```xml       <routeBuilder xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint">         <component id="consul" serviceClass="org.apache.camel.consul.ConsulEndpoint">           <!-- Provide the Consul client instance using the consulClient option -->           <propertyName>consulClient</propertyName>           <!-- Define other Consul endpoint properties here -->         </component>         <!-- Define your route logic here, utilizing the "consul" component as needed -->       </routeBuilder>       ```              In this example, you would replace `<propertyName>consulClient</propertyName>` with an actual instance of a `org.kiwiproject.consul.Consul` object. This instance would have been previously registered in your application''s registry, allowing the "consul" component to access it.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel Consul option named "key", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "key" option in the Apache Camel Consul component serves as a default key for accessing data from HashiCorp''s Consul service. It can be overridden using the CamelConsulKey. By default, it has no set value (defaultValue: null), meaning you can specify a key when using this component, but it is not strictly required as its absence would default to the user-provided key or the default key if one was specified. This option falls under the common group of options for easier categorization and use.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and whether it is required for the "pingInstance" option in the Apache Camel Consul component, regarding whether the AgentClient tries a ping before returning the Consul instance?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the "pingInstance" option in the Apache Camel Consul component is that it is set to true. This means that the AgentClient will attempt a ping before returning the Consul instance by default. However, it is not required to specify this option as it has a default value and can be omitted if not needed in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "readTimeout" option in the Apache Camel Consul component, and is it mandatory to set a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "readTimeout" option in the Apache Camel Consul component is a configuration setting for OkHttpClient, defining a read timeout duration. It specifies the maximum time that a read operation can take before timing out. By default, there''s no predefined value for this option, so you can set it according to your application''s needs. Whether or not you need to set a value for "readTimeout" is dependent on your use case; if you don''t set a value, the OkHttpClient will use its default timeout setting if one is configured. The "readTimeout" option belongs to the common group of configuration options in the Consul component.'
    - question: 'How can I set multiple tags for the Apache Camel Consul component using commas as a delimiter, and is it required to set any tags if there''s no default value provided?'
      answer: |
       'To set multiple tags for the Apache Camel Consul component using a comma as a delimiter, you can specify them within the "tags" option when configuring your component. For example:              ```       tags = "tag1, tag2, tag3"       ```              Note that it is not required to set any tags if there''s no default value provided for this option as indicated by the "defaultValue": null in the configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "url" option in the Apache Camel component ''Consul'', and does it have a default value? Also, is this option required, or can it be configured as optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "url" option in the Apache Camel component ''Consul'' is used to specify the URL of the Consul agent. This option allows Camel to connect to the Consul service. By default, the "url" option does not have a value assigned, meaning you need to provide it explicitly during configuration. The use of this option is optional; it can be configured as such within your setup if necessary.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "writeTimeout" option in the Apache Camel Consul component, and is it required for the usage of this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "writeTimeout" option in the Apache Camel Consul component is a configurable setting for the write timeout for OkHttpClient, which is used to control the duration for writing data before timing out. By default, it doesn''t have a specified value (defaultValue: null). This option is not required for the usage of the Consul component in Apache Camel, as indicated by "required": false. However, setting an appropriate write timeout can help ensure efficient and timely communication between your application and the Consul service.'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel Consul component''s bridgeErrorHandler option function, and under what conditions is it possible for this feature to be utilized? Additionally, could you explain why the default value for bridgeErrorHandler is set to false, and what alternative exception handling does the consumer use when this option is not enabled?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel Consul component''s "bridgeErrorHandler" option enables bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, allowing it to process exceptions as messages and handle them accordingly. This feature is only possible if the third-party component allows Camel to be alerted when an exception has been thrown. If the component handles exceptions internally, bridgeErrorHandler will not be feasible.              When the bridgeErrorHandler option is not enabled, the consumer uses the "org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler" forexception handling. These exceptions will be logged at either WARN or ERROR level and subsequently ignored. The default value of bridgeErrorHandler being set to false indicates that this advanced feature is disabled by default, allowing users to choose whether they want to utilize it depending on their specific use case and the behavior of their third-party component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the exceptionHandler option in the Apache Camel Consul component, and how can it be configured to use a custom ExceptionHandler? Additionally, what happens if the bridgeErrorHandler option is enabled and exceptionHandler is not in use by default?'
      answer: |
       'The `exceptionHandler` option in the Apache Camel Consul component allows you to use a custom exception handler for error management within your application. If the `bridgeErrorHandler` option is enabled, the `exceptionHandler` is not utilized and the default behavior will handle exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. To configure `exceptionHandler` with a custom ExceptionHandler, you can specify an object of your custom exception handling class when setting up your Consul component in your Camel routing configuration. If `bridgeErrorHandler` is enabled and no custom exception handler is provided, the default behavior will remain unchanged.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the Apache Camel Consul component''s "exchangePattern" option when configuring a consumer, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the exchange pattern option in the Apache Camel Consul component when configuring a consumer is null. This option sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange, which determines how messages are exchanged between producer and consumer in AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol). It''s an advanced feature for consumers and not required for basic usage of the Camel Consul component, but can be used to fine-tune message exchange behavior.'
    - question: 'What is the default action for the Apache Camel Consul component''s "action" option, and can this default value be changed when using it in a Camel producer?'
      answer: |
       'The default action for the Apache Camel Consul component''s "action" option is not specified (indicated by `defaultValue: null`). However, you can override this default value with a custom action by using the CamelConsulAction. This flexibility allows you to tailor the behavior of the Consul component according to your specific requirements when working in a Camel producer context.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the "valueAsString" option in the Apache Camel Consul component, and is it required when using this option as a producer? Additionally, what type of value does this option expect and can it be manually set to true or false?'
      answer: |
       'The "valueAsString" option in the Apache Camel Consul component defaults to transforming values retrieved from the Consul Key-Value (KV) endpoint into strings. This behavior is not required, as you can opt out of it if needed. Regarding the type of value this option expects, it''s a boolean, specifically accepting true or false values. You can manually set its value to true or false according to your needs.'
    - question: 'How does the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Consul component affect the startup behavior, and why might it be useful to set this option to true in some situations?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Consul component allows you to defer the starting of a producer until the first message is processed. This can be useful in scenarios where the producer might fail during startup, causing the entire route to fail as well. By setting this option to true, you can allow the CamelContext and routes to start up without issues, and then handle any potential startup failures through Camel''s routing error handlers while processing messages. However, keep in mind that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time, potentially prolonging the overall processing time of the route.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''consistencyMode'' option in the Apache Camel Consul component and what is its default value, as well as whether it is required or considered an advanced feature?'
      answer: |
       'The ''consistencyMode'' option in the Apache Camel Consul component is designed to control the level of data consistency for queries. By default, it uses ConsistencyMode.DEFAULT, meaning it will attempt to balance between strong consistency (ensuring all replicas agree before returning a result) and eventual consistency (returning a result even if not all replicas have been updated). This option is considered an advanced feature as it allows fine-tuning of data consistency in your application, and its usage is optional as the default value provides a good balance for most use cases.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "datacenter" option in the Apache Camel Consul component, and is it mandatory to set this option when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "datacenter" option in the Apache Camel Consul component is designed to specify the data center for service discovery purposes. However, it does not have a default value, meaning you should provide one if you choose to use it. It''s not mandatory to set this option when using the Consul component as its functionality can still work without it, but setting it can enhance the effectiveness of service discovery based on the data center configuration in Consul.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "nearNode" option in the Apache Camel Consul component, if it is not required, and what type of value should it receive when set?'
      answer: |
       'The "nearNode" option within the Apache Camel Consul component is an advanced configuration setting that specifies the Consul node to use for queries. While it''s optional (as indicated by the "required": false), you can provide a string value to explicitly select a nearby Consul node when making requests, potentially improving performance in distributed systems by reducing network latency. If not set, Camel will default to automatically selecting a node based on your system''s current conditions.'
    - question: 'How is the "nodeMeta" option in the Apache Camel Consul component utilized, and what data type should it contain according to its definition? Additionally, is providing a value for this option mandatory or optional?'
