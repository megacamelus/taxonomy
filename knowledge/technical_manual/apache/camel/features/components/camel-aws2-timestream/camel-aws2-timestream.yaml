    - question: 'What is the default and optional configuration for the "configuration" option within the Apache Camel aws2-timestream component when it''s used as a producer?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "configuration" option within the Apache Camel aws2- timestream component, when used as a producer, is null. This means that no configuration is set by default. However, this option is not mandatory, so you can choose to provide custom configurations if needed, although it''s not required. The configurations pertain to the AWS TimeSeries component and are categorized under the "producer" groups.'
    - question: 'Is it recommended to set the "lazyStartProducer" option in an Apache Camel route that uses the AWS Timestream component (aws2-timestream) to true or false, considering its effects on the initial startup and processing time?'
      answer: |
       'When using the AWS Timestream component (aws2-timestream) within an Apache Camel route, it is recommended that you consider setting the "lazyStartProducer" option to true if there''s a possibility of the producer causing issues during initial startup and potentially making the entire route fail. This option allows the producer to defer starting until the first message is processed, which enables the handling of any potential startup failures using Camel''s routing error handlers.              However, it''s essential to note that activating this lazy start will cause the initial processing time to be prolonged since creating and starting the producer may require a little more time when the first message is processed. In cases where faster initial processing is important, or the producer always starts without issues during initialization, setting "lazyStartProducer" to false might be a suitable choice. Nonetheless, considering the context of your specific application usage, evaluating both options and their corresponding benefits could lead to making an informed decision.'
    - question: 'What is the default and valid list of operation types for the Apache Camel `aws2-timestream` component when used as a producer, and what groups does this option belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The default operation type for the Apache Camel `aws2-timestream` component when used as a producer is null. Valid operation types include describeEndpoints, createBatchLoadTask, describeBatchLoadTask, resumeBatchLoadTask, listBatchLoadTasks, createDatabase, deleteDatabase, describeDatabase, updateDatabase, listDatabases, createTable, deleteTable, describeTable, updateTable, listTables, writeRecords, createScheduledQuery, deleteScheduledQuery, executeScheduledQuery, updateScheduledQuery, describeScheduledQuery, listScheduledQueries, prepareQuery, query, cancelQuery. This option belongs to the "producer" group.'
    - question: 'Here is a question that could be asked regarding the Apache Camel `aws2-timestream` component''s `overrideEndpoint` option:              "When using the Apache Camel AWS Timestream producer, how can one set up the ''overrideEndpoint'' option to modify the endpoint URI? And, what should be the default behavior when this option is not provided?"'
      answer: |
       'To modify the endpoint URI when using the Apache Camel AWS Timestream producer''s `overrideEndpoint` option, you should set it to true and also provide a value for the `uriEndpointOverride` option. The default behavior when this option is not provided is false, meaning the default endpoint will be used.'
    - question: 'Here is a potential question related to the Apache Camel aws2-timestream "pojoRequest" option, based on the provided information:              "What is the purpose of the ''pojoRequest'' option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Timestream component and is it required to use a POJO request as the body when this option is set to true or false?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''pojoRequest'' option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component allows you to specify whether to use a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) as the request body when sending data to AWS Timestream. When set to true, a POJO can be used as the request body; however, if set to false (the default value), another format may be utilized. It''s essential to note that using a POJO as the request body is not mandatory, regardless of the setting for this option.'
    - question: 'How do I specify the profile name when using an AWS credentials profile with the Apache Camel `aws2-timestream` component as a producer, if I choose to provide one?'
      answer: |
       'To specify the profile name when using an AWS credentials profile with the Apache Camel `aws2-timestream` component as a producer, you can set the "profileCredentialsName" parameter to the desired profile name. If not specified, this parameter defaults to null, meaning it won''t use a specific profile.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and correct usage format of the "region" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component, along with information on its default value, data type, whether it''s required or not, and any groups it belongs to?'
      answer: |
       'The "region" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component serves to specify the region where your Timestream client should operate. When using this parameter, ensure you provide the lowercase name of the region (e.g., ap-east-1), using the format Region.EU_WEST_1.id(). This option is of type string, and its default value is null. It is not required but falls under the "producer" group for configuration purposes.'
    - question: 'Here is a question that can be answered using the provided information:              In relation to the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component, when should we set the option "trustAllCertificates" to true, and what is its default value? (Note: The groups this option belongs to are ''producer'')'
      answer: |
       'To trust all certificates in the case of overriding the endpoint for the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component, you should set the "trustAllCertificates" option to true. However, keep in mind that this is not the default setting - by default, it''s false. The option "trustAllCertificates" belongs to the ''producer'' group of configurations.'
    - question: '"When using the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream producer component, can you explain the purpose of the ''uriEndpointOverride'' option and under which conditions it should be used?"'
      answer: |
       'When utilizing the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream producer component, the ''uriEndpointOverride'' option is designed to allow you to specify an alternate URI endpoint for the Timestream service. This option should be employed in combination with the ''overrideEndpoint'' option. It''s important to note that the usage of ''uriEndpointOverride'' is optional and its purpose is primarily for scenarios where you need to use a custom or specific endpoint for your AWS Timestream resource.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" option within the Apache Camel "aws2-timestream" component, and can it be marked as optional in the configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" option within the Apache Camel "aws2-timestream" component determines whether the Timestream client should load credentials dynamically through a default credentials provider or receive static credentials directly in the configuration. Its default value is false, meaning it does not use dynamic loading by default. Yes, this option can be marked as optional in the configuration since setting it to false implies that static credentials will be provided elsewhere in the setup.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel AWS2 Timestream component, specifically the "useProfileCredentialsProvider" option, to set the Timestream client to load credentials through a profile credentials provider? Is there any difference in behavior if this option is not explicitly set? And, where does this configuration apply within the producer group of the AWS2-Timestream component?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the AWS2 Timestream component in Apache Camel specifically for using a profile credentials provider, you should set the "useProfileCredentialsProvider" option to true. This means that the Timestream client will load your AWS credentials from a credentials file located at ~/.aws/credentials where each profile is specified with its own access key and secret key.              If you do not explicitly set this option, it will default to false, and Camel will load the credentials using its default mechanism instead (e.g., programmatically or by setting environment variables).              This configuration applies within the ''producer'' group of the AWS2-Timestream component, which pertains to configuring data producers that write data into Timestream.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel''s aws2-timestream component, and can it be required or disabled if needed?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in Apache Camel''s aws2-timestream component is a boolean value that determines whether autowiring is enabled by default. Autowiring allows for automatic configuration of components such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc., by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type. This option can be used for simplifying the setup and configuration process. The default value of "autowiredEnabled" is true, but it can be disabled or set to false if needed, although it is not a required setting and can be found in the advanced group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the option "awsTimestreamQueryClient" in the Apache Camel component "aws2-timestream", and can you explain how to use an existing configured AwsTimestreamQueryClient client with this option, as indicated by its description?'
      answer: |
       'The option "awsTimestreamQueryClient" in the Apache Camel component "aws2-timestream" is used when you have an already configured `AwsTimestreamQueryClient` that you''d like to use instead of creating a new one within your Camel integration. To use an existing configured `AwsTimestreamQueryClient`, you can set it as the value for this option. Here is an example of how to do this:              ```java       AwsTimestreamQueryClient myConfiguredAwsClient = // initialize and configure your AwsTimestreamQueryClient              from("aws2-timestream")           .option(Exchange.awsTimestreamQueryClient, myConfiguredAwsClient);       ```              In this example, `myConfiguredAwsClient` is an instance of the `AwsTimestreamQueryClient` that you''ve configured according to your specific use-case requirements. By providing this already set-up client in the option parameter for `Exchange.awsTimestreamQueryClient`, you ensure its usage instead of creating a new one, as per the description provided for this option. Keep in mind that using this "advanced" group setting can optimize performance if you have complex and time-sensitive operations across your AWS Timestream integration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and how can I configure the `awsTimestreamWriteClient` option within the Apache Camel `aws2-timestream` component, and is it mandatory to provide a default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The `awsTimestreamWriteClient` option within the Apache Camel `aws2-timestream` component is an optional configuration that allows you to use an existing configured AwsTimestreamWriteClient client when writing data to Amazon Timestream. If you wish to provide this configuration, you can do so in your Camel route by explicitly setting it. However, no default value is provided for this option, meaning you must create and configure the AwsTimestreamWriteClient separately before passing it to the component. This configuration falls under advanced usage groupings of the AWS Timestream component within Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and if it can be changed, how to configure the Apache Camel aws2-timestream component''s option "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" for enabling or disabling all consumer-based health checks from this component? Additionally, which group does this option belong to in terms of its configuration context?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel aws2-timestream component is that it is enabled (set to true). If you wish to change its state, you can configure it by setting this option to false, which will disable all consumer-based health checks from this component. This option belongs to the "health" group in terms of its configuration context.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the `healthCheckProducerEnabled` option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Timestream component, and what purpose does it serve when this option is set to true or false?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `healthCheckProducerEnabled` option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Timestream component is `true`. This option is used to enable or disable all producer-based health checks from this component. When it is set to true, producer health-checks will be activated, allowing you to monitor the status and performance of your producers. Conversely, setting it to false will deactivate these checks. It''s important to note that by default, Camel has disabled all producer-based health-checks. You can turn on producer checks globally by setting `camel.health.producersEnabled=true`.'
    - question: 'How do you set or configure the ''proxyHost'' option in Apache Camel''s aws2-timestream component, if you want to specify a proxy host when instantiating the Timestream client? Is there a default value for this option and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'To set or configure the ''proxyHost'' option in Apache Camel''s aws2-timestream component, you can define it as a string while instantiating the Timestream client. This option allows you to specify a proxy host when required. However, note that the default value for this option is null. Whether or not you need to provide a ''proxyHost'' depends on your specific use case; if you are not using a proxy server, you can choose to omit it as the ''required'' value for this option is false.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the "proxyPort" option when using the Apache Camel component "aws2-timestream", and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyPort" option, when using the Apache Camel component "aws2-timestream", serves the purpose of defining a proxy port when instantiating the Timestream client. It allows you to specify an alternate port number if your client needs to connect via a proxy server. However, it is important to note that providing a value for this option is not mandatory; its default value is null or unset. Therefore, you can either provide a custom integer value for the proxy port if required or simply skip it if no proxy connection is necessary.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "proxyProtocol" option when instantiating an AWS Timestream client using the Apache Camel''s aws2-timestream component, and is it required to use this option? (Hint: This option allows you to define a proxy protocol.)'
      answer: |
       'When instantiating an AWS Timestream client using the Apache Camel''s `aws2-timestream` component, the "proxyProtocol" option can be used to define a proxy protocol configuration. The default value of this option is HTTPS. However, it is not mandatory to use this option as its usage depends on whether you are employing a proxy for your connection. This option allows you to specify the proxy settings when using a proxy server for your data transfer with AWS Timestream.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, required status, and possible group affiliation of the "accessKey" option in the Apache Camel component named "aws2-timestream"?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessKey" option within the AWS2 Timestream component of Apache Camel is a string variable that serves as your Amazon AWS Access Key. Its default value is null, meaning you must provide it during configuration as it''s not automatically assigned. As for its group affiliation, this particular option falls under the ''security'' group since handling your access key involves managing sensitive credentials associated with AWS services.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and description, whether it''s optional or required, type of data, default value, and group affiliation for the option ''secretKey'' in the Apache Camel aws2-timestream component?'
      answer: |
       'The ''secretKey'' option within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Timestream component in Apache Camel is a string type data that serves as your AWS Secret Key. It''s optional, meaning you don''t necessarily have to provide it when configuring this component. However, if you choose not to supply the secretKey, it defaults to having no value. This option falls under the ''security'' group due to its sensitivity and importance in accessing AWS services.'
    - question: 'What is the possible list of operations that can be performed using the Apache Camel AWS2-TimeStream component''s "operation" option when producing messages? (Choose from: describeEndpoints, createBatchLoadTask, describeBatchLoadTask, resumeBatchLoadTask, listBatchLoadTasks, createDatabase, deleteDatabase, describeDatabase, updateDatabase, listDatabases, createTable, deleteTable, describeTable, updateTable, listTables, writeRecords, createScheduledQuery, deleteScheduledQuery, executeScheduledQuery, updateScheduledQuery, describeScheduledQuery, listScheduledQueries, prepareQuery, query, cancelQuery)'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel AWS2-TimeStream component''s "operation" option allows performing a variety of operations when producing messages. These include: describeEndpoints, createBatchLoadTask, describeBatchLoadTask, resumeBatchLoadTask, listBatchLoadTasks, createDatabase, deleteDatabase, describeDatabase, updateDatabase, listDatabases, createTable, deleteTable, describeTable, updateTable, listTables, writeRecords, createScheduledQuery, deleteScheduledQuery, executeScheduledQuery, updateScheduledQuery, describeScheduledQuery, listScheduledQueries, prepareQuery, query, and cancelQuery.'
    - question: 'Can you explain when and how to use the "overrideEndpoint" option in the Apache Camel "aws2-timestream" component, considering it must be employed along with the "uriEndpointOverride" option? Furthermore, can you clarify its default value, data type, required status, and group association, as well as if there are any specific use cases or scenarios where this option would be particularly beneficial in working with Amazon Timestream?'
      answer: |
       'The "overrideEndpoint" option in the Apache Camel "aws2-timestream" component is employed when you need to override the default endpoint URL of AWS Timestream. It should be used together with the "uriEndpointOverride" option. This combination allows you to specify a custom endpoint URL for AWS Timestream, rather than using the one provided by default.              By default, the "overrideEndpoint" value is set to false. It accepts Boolean data type and has an optional usage, meaning it''s not mandatory to provide a value if no custom endpoint override is required. The group associated with this option is "producer".              There are specific use cases or scenarios where using the "overrideEndpoint" option may be beneficial in working with Amazon Timestream. For instance, if you have a need to connect to a different AWS region''s Timestream service, or you are dealing with a non-default endpoint URL for some reason, you would make use of this option. In these situations, providing the appropriate value for "uriEndpointOverride" and setting "overrideEndpoint" to true will ensure your application can successfully establish a connection with AWS Timestream.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and requirement for using a POJO request as the body in an AWS Timestream message when using the Apache Camel "aws2-timestream" component, specifically the "pojoRequest" option? Is it optional or required? Does it have a default value and if so, what is it?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for using a POJO request as the body in an AWS Timestream message, when using the Apache Camel "aws2-timestream" component with the "pojoRequest" option, is that it''s not used by default (defaultValue: false). Its usage is optional (required: false), meaning you can choose to include a POJO request in your body or not.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "profileCredentialsName" option in the Apache Camel component "aws2-timestream", and can it be left empty if a default value is not provided for this parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The "profileCredentialsName" option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Timestream component allows you to specify a profile name when using a credentials provider. If no explicit value is set, the use of this parameter is optional, and it can be left empty if a default value is not provided for this parameter.'
    - question: 'What is the expected format and default value for the "region" option when configuring the Apache Camel AWS Timestream component, and is its use optional? (The correct answer is: The expected format is a lowercase string representing the region name, such as ap-east-1. Its default value is null, and its use is optional.)'
      answer: |
       'In the context of configuring the Apache Camel AWS Timestream component, the "region" option takes a lowercase string format representing the region name (e.g., ap-east-1). The default value for this option is null, indicating that you don''t have to specify it if you wish. However, its usage is optional.'
    - question: 'Can you explain what happens when the option "trustAllCertificates" is set to true for the Apache Camel AWS2-TimeSeries producer component?'
      answer: |
       'When the option "trustAllCertificates" is set to true for the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream producer component, it signifies that all SSL/TLS certificates presented by the endpoint will be accepted without verification, effectively bypassing any checks that would normally occur during certificate validation. This might seem risky as untrusted or compromised certificates can potentially expose your system to security issues such as man-in-the-middle attacks. However, in situations where you have control over both ends of the connection and want to skip the overhead of manual certificate management, this option may be useful. Please note that this is a potential security risk and should only be enabled when necessary, with a clear understanding of the associated implications.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "uriEndpointOverride" option within the Apache Camel component "aws2-timestream", and under what circumstances should it be used along with the "overrideEndpoint" option? Is there a default value for this option, and if so, what is it?'
      answer: |
       'The "uriEndpointOverride" option within the Apache Camel component "aws2-timestream" serves the purpose of allowing you to set an overriding URI endpoint. This option should be used in conjunction with the "overrideEndpoint" option. In scenarios where you wish to use a specific AWS Timestream URI endpoint instead of the default one, you can make use of this option. However, it is important to note that the usage of both options together is optional as there is no default value specified for the "uriEndpointOverride". This configuration falls under the "producer" group in your Camel context.'
    - question: 'Can you explain how the boolean option "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" in the Apache Camel AWS2-TimeStream component affects the loading of credentials for Timestream client interactions? And, could you clarify what the default value of this option is and under what circumstances it would not be required to explicitly set its value?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Amazon Timestream and the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component, the boolean option "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" determines whether the Timestream client should automatically load credentials through a default provider or if static credentials are to be provided directly. By default, this option is set to false, indicating that static credentials will not be expected. However, if your setup includes a default credentials provider (such as an IAM role for AWS SDKs) and you do not wish to pass the credentials explicitly, then it''s unnecessary to explicitly set "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" to true.'
    - question: '"In the context of using the Apache Camel aws2-timestream component, if I choose to set the option ''useProfileCredentialsProvider'' to true, what impact will this have on how the Timestream client loads its credentials?"'
      answer: |
       'Setting the option ''useProfileCredentialsProvider'' to true in the context of using the Apache Camel aws2-timestream component means that the Timestream client will load its credentials through a profile credentials provider. This is different from explicitly specifying AWS access key ID and secret access key, as it allows you to use an IAM user or role whose credentials are managed through AWS CLI or AWS Management Console. By doing so, you can control access at the individual rather than shared level, improving security best practices in your environment.'
    - question: 'In relation to the Apache Camel component "aws2-timestream", can you explain when it would be beneficial to set the option "lazyStartProducer" to true and what potential implications this could have on the performance of a CamelContext route?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the option "lazyStartProduper" to true in the AWS Timestream component for Apache Camel can be beneficial when your application or service starts up in situations where initializing the producer might otherwise cause startup failures, leading to the entire route failing. This is because the producer will only start when the first message arrives, instead of during the CamelContext or route initialization phase.              If a failure occurs during production startup, the error can be handled via Camel''s routing error handlers, ensuring that your application remains operational while resolving the issue. However, there could be potential implications on performance as the first message processing time may slightly increase due to the additional time taken to create and start the producer. Therefore, consider setting this option judiciously based on your application''s specific requirements and error-handling strategies.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel aws2-timestream component to utilize an existing AwsTimestreamQueryClient object, rather than creating a new one by default?'
      answer: |
       'To use an existing `AwsTimestreamQueryClient` object with the Apache Camel `aws2-timestream` component, you can configure it to take your predefined client instead of creating a new one by default. To achieve this, you should pass the `AwsTimestreamQueryClient` instance as a configuration option when initializing the Camel route. Since the component is an object, the required key for passing the customized client would be "awsTimestreamQueryClient". Here''s an example:              ```java       MyCustomAwsTimestreamQueryClient myCustomClient = createMyCustomAwsTimestreamQueryClient(); // your method to return a predefined AwsTimestreamQueryClient              from("direct:start")           .component("aws2-timestream")           .property(Exchange.AWS_TIMERSTREAM_QUERY_CLIENT, myCustomClient)  // pass the customized client as property to component           // rest of the route...       ```'
    - question: 'How can I set or specify an existing AwsTimestreamWriteClient object in the "awsTimestreamWriteClient" option when using the Apache Camel aws2-timestream component? Is it required and does it have a default value?'
      answer: |
       'To set an existing `AwsTimestreamWriteClient` object in the "awsTimestreamWriteClient" option when using the Apache Camel AWS2 Timestream component, you can pass it as an argument. This option is not required, meaning it has a null default value. However, if you want to use your own configured client, you should provide one explicitly. This configuration group falls under "advanced".'
    - question: 'How should one specify a proxy host while instantiating an Apache Camel AWS2 Timestream client component, if there is a need to use a proxy?'
      answer: |
       'To specify a proxy host while instantiating an Apache Camel AWS2 Timestream client component, you can set the "proxyHost" option. This is done within the client instantiation. If your setup requires a proxy, you may assign the appropriate proxy host to this option as a string value. Please note that using a proxy is optional and setting "proxyHost" is only necessary if needed for your configuration. For instance:              ```java       TimestreamComponent timestreamComponent = new TimestreamComponent("myAwsTimestreamEndpoint");       timestreamComponent.setProperty(ExchangePropertyKey.ProxyHost, "your_proxy_host"); // replace with your actual proxy host       TimestreamProducer producer = timestreamComponent.createProducer();       ```'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''proxyPort'' option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Timestream component, if it is to be defined and what type of data should be provided for this option? Does it have a default value or is it a mandatory parameter to use when instantiating the Timestream client, and under which configuration group does it fall?'
      answer: |
       'The ''proxyPort'' option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Timestream component serves to define a proxy port when initializing the Timestream client. This is useful when your environment requires using a proxy server for accessing resources. However, it is not a mandatory parameter; its use is optional. In terms of the type of data to be provided, an integer value should be supplied for this option. Lastly, the ''proxyPort'' falls under the ''proxy'' configuration group. If no specific proxy port has been defined, there is no default value for this option.'
    - question: 'How do I configure the proxy protocol when using the Apache Camel aws2-timestream component? Is there a default value for this option and is it optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the proxy protocol when using the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component, you can define it as an option at instantiation of the Timestream client. The name of the option is "proxyProtocol". The default value for this option is HTTPS but it can be overridden if needed. It is an optional configuration, meaning that providing it is not compulsory. The option belongs to the "proxy" group of configuration options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "accessKey" option in the Apache Camel component named "aws2-timestream", and what data type does it accept? Additionally, is providing an access key mandatory for using this component or can its use be omitted?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessKey" option in the "aws2-timestream" component of Apache Camel represents the Amazon AWS Access Key. This option is related to the security group. It accepts a string data type, but it''s important to note that there is no default value provided for this option. Using this access key is not mandatory for operating the "aws2-timestream" component; providing an access key is optional.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, description, default value, type, requirement status, and group affiliation of the "secretKey" option within the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component?'
      answer: |
       'The "secretKey" option within the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component is designed for storing the Amazon AWS Secret Key. Its purpose is to authenticate with AWS services that require secret keys, such as AWS Timestream. The description of this option is "Amazon AWS Secret Key". The default value for this option is null, meaning it requires explicit configuration. Type-wise, this option is a string. Regarding its requirement status, it is optional (required: false). Lastly, in terms of group affiliation, it falls under the "security" group due to its sensitive nature.'
