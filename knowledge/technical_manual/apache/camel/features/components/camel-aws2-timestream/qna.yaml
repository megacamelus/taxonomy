    - question: 'What is the default configuration for the "configuration" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-TimeStream producer component, and is it required to be set when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default configuration for the "configuration" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream producer component is null, meaning no default value is provided. However, setting this option is not a mandatory requirement as it can be left unused if you don''t need to specify any custom configurations when using this component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Timestream component, and under what circumstances might it be beneficial to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Timestream component is designed to control whether the producer should be started immediately (default: false) or delayed until the first message arrives. When set to true, it allows the CamelContext and routes to initialize even if a producer may initially fail during startup, preventing the entire route from failing. In such cases, the production failure can later be managed via Camel''s routing error handlers. However, enabling lazy start may cause a slight delay in processing the first message as creating and starting the producer takes additional time. This option might be useful when dealing with situations where producing data may potentially cause issues during route startup.'
    - question: 'What is the default operation that can be performed using the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream producer component and what are the available options for this operation?'
      answer: |
       'The default operation that can be performed using the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream producer component is not specified by default (defaultValue: null). However, there are several available operations including describeEndpoints, createBatchLoadTask, describeBatchLoadTask, resumeBatchLoadTask, listBatchLoadTasks, createDatabase, deleteDatabase, describeDatabase, updateDatabase, listDatabases, createTable, deleteTable, describeTable, updateTable, listTables, writeRecords, createScheduledQuery, deleteScheduledQuery, executeScheduledQuery, updateScheduledQuery, describeScheduledQuery, listScheduledQueries, prepareQuery, query, cancelQuery. These operations are categorized under the producer group called "producer".'
    - question: 'How can you configure the Apache Camel aws2-timestream component to override the endpoint using the `uriEndpointOverride` option? Is it necessary to set the `overrideEndpoint` option to true when using this feature, and is it a required configuration?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the AWS Timestream component in Apache Camel to override the endpoint using the `uriEndpointOverride` option, you should be aware that setting the `overrideEndpoint` option to true is not necessary, as it''s only used in combination with `uriEndpointOverride`. However, setting `overrideEndpoint` to true is not required for this feature. When working with the producer group, keep in mind that both options can help tailor your AWS Timestream interactions according to your specific needs.'
    - question: 'Here is a question that can be answered with the provided information:              Can I use a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) as the request body when using the Apache Camel AWS2 Timestream component for producing messages, and if so, how is this configured?'
      answer: |
       'Yes, you can indeed use a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) as the request body when utilizing the Apache Camel AWS2 Timestream component for message production. The configuration for this can be achieved by setting the "pojoRequest" option to true. This option is found within the component''s configuration, under the "groups" labeled as "producer". In your Camel route, you would set it like so:              ```java       from("aws2-timestream:producer")           .setBody(simple("{\"myPojo\": {\"field1\": \"value1\", \"field2\": \"value2\"}}")) // Replace with your POJO instance as a JSON string           ...;       ```              In the above example, the "{...}" section represents your POJO instance serialized as a JSON string. You would replace it with your specific POJO and its data. By default, this option is set to false, so if you want to use a POJO request body, ensure that you explicitly set "pojoRequest" to true in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "profileCredentialsName" option in the Apache Camel component "aws2-timestream", and can it be left empty by default?'
      answer: |
       'The "profileCredentialsName" option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Timestream component serves to specify a profile name if you''re using a profile credentials provider. It allows you to switch between different AWS credential profiles as needed. However, it is important to note that this parameter has a default value of null, meaning that you can leave it empty by default if you''re not explicitly setting a specific profile.'
    - question: 'What is the correct syntax and usage for setting the AWS Timestream region using Apache Camel''s aws2-timestream component, if I want to use a specific region (e.g., Region.EU_WEST_1) but it''s optional?'
      answer: |
       'To set the AWS Timestream region using Apache Camel''s aws2-timestream component when you want to use a specific region (e.g., Region.EU_WEST_1), but it''s optional, you can provide the region as a string within the configuration of the component.              Here is an example syntax:              ```java       aws2TimestreamComponent.region(Region.EU_WEST_1.id());       ```              Keep in mind that the region name should be in lowercase (e.g., ap-east-1) and you''ll need to use the `id()` method to specify the region when using it with Apache Camel. The configuration groups for this option are under "producer".'
    - question: '"In the context of using Apache Camel''s aws2-timestream component for data production, when should we set the ''trustAllCertificates'' option to true in order to trust all certificates presented during the connection if we want to override the endpoint?"'
      answer: |
       'To trust all certificates presented during the connection when using Apache Camel''s aws2-timestream component for data production, you should set the ''trustAllCertificates'' option to true if you wish to override the endpoint and not verify the SSL/TLS certificates of the AWS TimeSeries API. This is an optional setting with a default value of false, meaning that certificate verification is enabled by default. You can choose to enable it under the "producer" group in your configuration settings when you find it necessary to trust all certificates.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "uriEndpointOverride" option within the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component, and under what circumstances would it be required or useful to set this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "uriEndpointOverride" option within the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component allows you to explicitly set the URI endpoint for your Amazon TimeSeries database connection. This is particularly useful when you need to use a custom endpoint, instead of the default one provided by AWS. It should be used in conjunction with the "overrideEndpoint" option. The requirement to set this option arises when you want to connect to a specific region or custom-created TimeSeries database endpoint that differs from the standard AWS endpoints. This option falls under the "producer" group of options, indicating it is primarily used for producing data into an Amazon TimeSeries database.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and purpose of the "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" option within the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component, and can it be configured as optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component determines whether the Timestream client should automatically load credentials or receive static credentials for use. By default, it is set to false, meaning that static credentials are expected. However, you can configure it to be optional, allowing the Timestream client to load credentials through a default provider if no static credentials are provided. This setting belongs to the "producer" group of options in the AWS2-Timestream component.'
    - question: '"What is the purpose and default value of the ''useProfileCredentialsProvider'' option in the Apache Camel ''aws2-timestream'' component, and can it be marked as required or optional?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''useProfileCredentialsProvider'' option in the Apache Camel ''aws2-timestream'' component is designed to control whether the Timestream client should load credentials through a profile credentials provider. By default, this option is set to false, meaning that the client will not use a profile credentials provider. You can choose to set it to true if you wish to use a profile for loading your AWS credentials. This option is optional since it''s not required for basic functionality, but you can modify it according to your project needs within the ''producer'' group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "aws2-timestream", and under what circumstances can this option be considered optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel AWS2 Timestream component is a boolean setting that determines whether autowiring is enabled for automatic configuration of components like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, etc. Its default value is true, meaning autowiring is enabled by default. This option can be considered optional under circumstances where you do not require or prefer manual configuration over automatic one. It belongs to the "advanced" group of options in Camel components.'
    - question: 'How do I configure and utilize the `awsTimestreamQueryClient` option in the Apache Camel `aws2-timestream` component for using an existing `AwsTimestreamQueryClient` client instance, if it is not set by default?'
      answer: |
       'To configure and utilize the `awsTimestreamQueryClient` option in the Apache Camel `aws2-timestream` component with an existing `AwsTimestreamQueryClient` client instance, you can create and set up this client separately before using it within your Camel route. However, since the `awsTimestreamQueryClient` is not set by default, you''ll need to specify it explicitly in your route configuration.              Here''s a simple example of how to do this:              1. First, create an instance of `AwsTimestreamQueryClient` outside the Camel route and configure it as needed with AWS credentials, region, and other settings.              ```java       import software.amazon.awssdk.regions.Region;       import software.amazon.awssdk.services.timestreamquery.AwsTimestreamQueryClient;       import software.amazon.awssdk.auth.credentials.AWSStaticCredentialsProvider;              AwsTimestreamQueryClient timestreamQueryClient = AwsTimestreamQueryClient.builder()           .withRegion(Region.US_EAST_1)           .withCredentials(AWSStaticCredentialsProvider.create(new AWSStaticCredentialsProvider(awsAccessKey, awsSecretKey)))           .build();       ```              2. Then, within your Camel route, use the `awsTimestreamQueryClient` option to pass this client instance to the `aws2-timestream` component.              ```java       from("direct:start")           .to("aws2-timestream"               .awsTimestreamQueryClient(timestreamQueryClient) // specify your existing client here               .sqlSql("SELECT * FROM MyTable"))           .log("Data retrieved: ${body}");       ```              With this setup, you are now using an existing `AwsTimestreamQueryClient` instance within the Apache Camel `aws2-timestream` component.'
    - question: 'How do I configure and use the `awsTimestreamWriteClient` option in the Apache Camel component `aws2-timestream`, when I want to utilize an existing configured `AwsTimestreamWriteClient` client?'
      answer: |
       'To utilize an existing configured `AwsTimestreamWriteClient` client with the Apache Camel component `aws2-timestream`, you should set the `awsTimestreamWriteClient` option when configuring your route or processor. Here''s an example of how to do it:              ```java       AwsTimestreamWriteClient awsTimestreamWriteClient = // Your existing configured AwsTimestreamWriteClient instance              CamelContext camelContext = new DefaultCamelContext();              AWSTimestreamComponent timestreamComponent = new AWSTimestreamComponent(camelContext);       timestreamComponent.setAwsTimestreamWriteClient(awsTimestreamWriteClient);              RouteBuilder routeBuilder = new RouteBuilder() {           @Override           public void configure() throws Exception {               from("direct:myTimerStreamProducer")                   .to("aws2-timestream:myTable"); // Use your table name instead of "myTable"           }       };              camelContext.addRoutes(routeBuilder);       camelContext.start();       ```              In this example, an existing `AwsTimestreamWriteClient` instance is set on the `AWSTimestreamComponent` before creating the Camel context. Then, when configuring the route, you can use the `aws2-timestream` endpoint as usual, but now it will utilize your existing configured client.'
    - question: 'How does one configure the option "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" in the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component, and what is its default value if not explicitly set? Also, in which group of options is this setting located within the component''s configuration?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option in the AWS2-Timestream component of Apache Camel, you can set it to either true or false within the component''s configuration. If not explicitly set, the default value is true. This setting is located under the "health" group of options within the component''s configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the Apache Camel component aws2-timestream option named healthCheckProducerEnabled, and can this option be required when using it? (The default value is true, and it can be used for enabling or disabling all producer based health checks from this component. It is not required.)'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel AWS2 Timestream component''s "healthCheckProducerEnabled" option determines whether to enable or disable all producer-based health checks originating from this component. By default, it is set to true. This option allows you to manage health checks globally; if you wish to turn on producer checks in Camel, you can do so by setting "camel.health.producersEnabled=true". However, using this option is not required.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "proxyHost" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component and is it required, or can it be set to a default value if not provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyHost" option within the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component serves the purpose of defining a proxy host when initiating the Timestream client. It''s an optional setting, meaning you can instantiate the client without providing it. If not provided, it will not have a default value. This option is grouped under the "proxy" category, indicating its relevance to proxy configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "proxyPort" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component, and is it required when instantiating the Timestream client?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyPort" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component serves to define a proxy port when you''re instantiating the Timestream client. However, it is not a required parameter as its default value is null. This means that providing a proxy port is optional when setting up your Timestream client. The group associated with this option is "proxy".'
    - question: 'How do you enable the use of a proxy protocol when instantiating an Amazon Timestream client using Apache Camel''s aws2-timestream component, and is it mandatory to define this option?'
      answer: |
       'To enable the use of a proxy protocol when instantiating an Amazon Timestream client using Apache Camel''s aws2-timestream component, you can set the "proxyProtocol" option in your configuration. However, defining this option is not mandatory as the default value is HTTPS. This option can be found under the "proxy" group within the component settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value (if any), data type, and requirement status of the "accessKey" option in the Apache Camel component named "aws2-timestream", and where does this option belong within the context of security settings?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessKey" option in the Apache Camel component named "aws2-timestream" is a string type parameter that represents an Amazon AWS Access Key. This key is used to authenticate your requests when interacting with AWS Timestream services. By default, it does not have a preset value (defaultValue: null). The requirement for providing this key is optional (required: false), meaning you can still use the component without it; however, it may limit certain functionalities. In terms of security settings, the "accessKey" option falls under the group "security", emphasizing its role in safeguarding access to your AWS resources.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value (if any), data type, and whether it is required to use the "secretKey" option in the Apache Camel component "aws2-timestream", under the group "security"? Is there a specific description provided for this option in the given information?'
      answer: |
       'The "secretKey" option in the Apache Camel component "aws2-timestream", falling under the "security" group, is designed to provide an Amazon AWS Secret Key. This option is not mandatory as its "required" value is false. Regarding its data type, it is a string. The default value for this option is null, meaning you need to provide your own secret key if you choose to use it. The provided information includes a description that explains the purpose of this option clearly.'
    - question: 'What are the possible operation values for the Apache Camel aws2-timestream component when configuring a producer, and is there a default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The AWS Timestream component within Apache Camel, when configured as a producer, supports several operations including: describeEndpoints, createBatchLoadTask, describeBatchLoadTask, resumeBatchLoadTask, listBatchLoadTasks, createDatabase, deleteDatabase, describeDatabase, updateDatabase, listDatabases, createTable, deleteTable, describeTable, updateTable, listTables, writeRecords, createScheduledQuery, deleteScheduledQuery, executeScheduledQuery, updateScheduledQuery, describeScheduledQuery, listScheduledQueries, prepareQuery, query, cancelQuery. However, it''s important to note that there is no default value for this operation option when configuring the producer using the aws2-timestream component.'
    - question: 'Can you explain when and how to use the "overrideEndpoint" option within the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component, considering that it should be used in conjunction with the "uriEndpointOverride" option, and provide an example of a scenario where setting this boolean value to true would be beneficial?'
      answer: |
       'The "overrideEndpoint" option within the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component is used to specify when you want to override the default endpoint. This option works in tandem with the "uriEndpointOverride" option, allowing you to provide a custom endpoint for your AWS Timestream connection.              A scenario where setting "overrideEndpoint" to true would be beneficial is when you need to connect to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Timestream instance that resides in a region other than the default one. By setting this boolean value to true, you can provide a URI for the custom endpoint using the "uriEndpointOverride" option, ensuring your application connects to the desired AWS Timestream instance.              For example: If your default region is ''us-west-2'' but you need to connect to an AWS Timestream instance in ''eu-west-1'', you can set "overrideEndpoint" to true and use the "uriEndpointOverride" option to specify the endpoint for your desired AWS Timestream instance in ''eu-west-1''. This will help ensure that your Apache Camel application connects to the correct AWS Timestream instance, regardless of its default region.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior when using a custom POJO as the body for messages produced by the Apache Camel AWS2-TimeStream component, and is it optional to use a POJO request as the body?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior when using a custom POJO as the body for messages produced by the Apache Camel AWS2-TimeStream component is not using a POJO request as the body. However, it''s an optional configuration; you can choose to use a POJO request as the body for your messages if desired.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "profileCredentialsName" option in the Apache Camel component named "aws2-timestream", and can it be specified as a string value, even though it''s not a required parameter? Also, what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "profileCredentialsName" option in the AWS Timestream component of Apache Camel can be used to specify a profile name if you are employing a profile credentials provider. This parameter allows flexibility by letting you switch between different AWS credential profiles as needed. Although it is not a required parameter, you can still provide it with a string value. The default value for this option is not set, meaning that if you decide not to specify a value, Camel will not automatically assign one.'
    - question: 'What is the correct format and data type for setting the AWS Timestream region in an Apache Camel configuration using the aws2-timestream component, and is it required? Additionally, what is the default value for this option, if any, and which group does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The correct format for setting the AWS Timestream region in an Apache Camel configuration using the aws2-timestream component is a string that represents the lowercase name of the region, such as "ap-east-1". However, this parameter is not required. If you choose to use it, you should access the name of the desired region using the Region.EU_WEST_1.id() method. The default value for this option is null. This configuration option belongs to the "producer" group.'
    - question: '"In what context and why would setting the ''trustAllCertificates'' option to true for the Apache Camel component ''aws2-timestream'' override endpoint certificates?"'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the AWS Timestream component in Apache Camel, setting the ''trustAllCertificates'' option to true will override the SSL certificate validation process. This means that it will trust all certificates presented during communication with the AWS Timestream endpoint, regardless of their authenticity or validity. This might be useful in specific scenarios where you have control over both ends of the connection and do not require strict certificate validation, such as testing or debugging purposes. However, in production environments, it is generally advisable to keep this option off for security reasons and ensure that only trusted certificates are accepted during communication with sensitive services like AWS Timestream.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the option named "uriEndpointOverride" in the Apache Camel component "aws2-timestream", and is it mandatory to use this option when working with producers? Additionally, can you explain how this option interacts with the "overrideEndpoint" option?'
      answer: |
       'The "uriEndpointOverride" option in the AWS Timestream component for Apache Camel allows you to specify an alternative URI endpoint for your connection. This option is intended to be used alongside the "overrideEndpoint" option, not separately. Using these options together enables customization of the endpoint URI rather than relying on the default one provided by AWS Timestream. It''s important to note that using "uriEndpointOverride" is not mandatory when working with producers; it provides flexibility for those who need to connect to a specific URI endpoint. In essence, the "uriEndpointOverride" option interacts with the "overrideEndpoint" option by allowing you to customize the URI endpoint when establishing a connection with AWS Timestream using Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" option within the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component, and can this configuration property be marked as optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component determines whether the Timestream client should load credentials through a default provider or receive static credentials directly. Its default value is false, meaning that it does not load credentials using a default provider by default. This configuration property can be marked as optional, as its setting to false indicates that no default credential loading will occur.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `useProfileCredentialsProvider` option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component to true affect the loading of credentials for Timestream client operations, and is this behavior optional?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `useProfileCredentialsProvider` option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component to true instructs the Timestream client to load credentials through a profile credentials provider instead of hardcoding them directly. This behavior is optional, as indicated by the default value being false and the option having a `required: false`.'
    - question: 'Can you explain the purpose and implications of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component aws2-timestream, specifically regarding its default value, types of values it accepts, when it should be used, and any potential performance impacts?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-TimeStream component is designed to control whether the producer should start immediately upon context initialization or be delayed until the first message arrives. By default, it is set to false, indicating that the producer will start upfront.              When set to true (lazy mode), the producer startup can be deferred, allowing the CamelContext and routes to initialize even in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting, preventing the entire route from failing as well. In such cases, the production failure can be handled by Camel''s routing error handlers when processing messages later on.              The "lazyStartProducer" option accepts boolean values (true or false). It falls under the advanced "producer" group of options and should be used when you anticipate potential issues during producer initialization that might cause the route to fail at startup, but can be handled through error handlers during message processing.              It is important to note that enabling lazy start may prolong the total processing time slightly as the first message processed will require creating and starting the producer. This additional time should be weighed against potential benefits such as increased flexibility in handling producer-related issues during runtime.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the ''awsTimestreamQueryClient'' option in the Apache Camel ''aws2-timestream'' component, and can it be used without providing a default value, given that it accepts an existing configured AwsTimestreamQueryClient client?'
      answer: |
       'The ''awsTimestreamQueryClient'' option in the Apache Camel ''aws2-timestream'' component is designed to utilize an already configured AwsTimestreamQueryClient instance, rather than creating a new one within the component itself. This allows for more fine-grained control over the client, such as managing connection pooling or reusing existing clients across multiple routes. Regarding your question about whether it can be used without providing a default value, yes, it can. As long as you have an existing AwsTimestreamQueryClient instance configured and passed to the component, you do not need to provide a default value with this option.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "awsTimestreamWriteClient" option in the Apache Camel component "aws2-timestream", and can it be used without being configured if it has a default value of null?'
      answer: |
       'The "awsTimestreamWriteClient" option within the Apache Camel component "aws2-timestream" is designed for using an existing configuration of the AwsTimestreamWriteClient client. This client is instrumental in writing data to Amazon Timestream. However, it''s important to note that this option has a default value of null, indicating it''s not required for basic usage. If you wish to use the AwsTimestreamWriteClient, you will need to configure it according to your specific needs, as it falls under the ''advanced'' group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "proxyHost" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyHost" option in the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component is intended for defining a proxy host when instantiating the Timestream client. However, providing a value for this option is not mandatory; it can be set to null if no proxy is needed. This option is part of the "proxy" group in the component''s configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "proxyPort" option in the Apache Camel component "aws2-timestream", and is it required when instantiating the Timestream client? Additionally, what data type is this option expected to be, and are there any specific groups of options to which it belongs?'
      answer: |
       'The "proxyPort" option in the Apache Camel component "aws2-timestream" is intended for defining a proxy port when instantiating the Timestream client. However, its default value is not specified (defaultValue: null). This option is not mandatory to use as it has a false value for the "required" field. The data type expected for this option is an integer. Lastly, it belongs to the specific group of options called "proxy".'
    - question: 'How do you configure the "proxyProtocol" option within an instance of the Apache Camel AWS2-Timestream component, and is it mandatory to set this option? (Answer: You can configure the "proxyProtocol" option when instantiating the Timestream client in Apache Camel. However, it is not a mandatory setting as indicated by its "required": false property in the provided documentation.)'
      answer: |
       'When working with the AWS2-Timestream component in Apache Camel, you can configure the "proxyProtocol" option if needed when instantiating the Timestream client. The presence or absence of this setting is flexible as its "required": false property suggests, meaning it''s not compulsory to include it during setup. You would set the "proxyProtocol" value according to your specific network configuration requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and group affiliation of the "accessKey" option in the Apache Camel component named "aws2-timestream"?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessKey" option in the Apache Camel component named "aws2-timestream" is intended for providing an Amazon AWS Access Key. By default, it does not have a value (defaultValue: null). The data type of this option is a string. Regarding group affiliation, it falls under the security group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the Amazon AWS Secret Key (secretKey) option in the Apache Camel aws2-timestream component, and is it a required configuration?'

       'The `Amazon AWS Secret Key` (secretKey) option in the Apache Camel `aws2-timestream` component serves as a means to securely authenticate your application with Amazon Web Services (AWS). This secret key is an essential part of your AWS Security Credentials and should be kept confidential. By default, this option has no preset value (defaultValue: null), meaning you''ll need to provide it at runtime when configuring the component. However, the use of this option is not mandatory; it can be omitted if you choose to use other methods to authenticate with AWS, but keep in mind that doing so may affect your application''s security. The `secretKey` falls under the "security" group of configurations, emphasizing its importance in maintaining a secure connection between your application and AWS Timestream services.'
