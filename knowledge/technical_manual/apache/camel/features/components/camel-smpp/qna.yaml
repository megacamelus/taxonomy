    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the option "initialReconnectDelay" for the Apache Camel SMPP component, if it is not required, and what unit is used to measure this delay?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "initialReconnectDelay" option in the Apache Camel SMPP component is 5000 milliseconds (or 5 seconds). This option defines the initial delay in milliseconds after the consumer/producer tries to reconnect to the Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMSC), after the connection was lost. It is an integer data type and, if not required, can be omitted.'
    - question: 'What is the default maximum number of attempts to reconnect to an SMSC when using Apache Camel''s SMPP component, if no negative bind response is received from the SMSC, and can this value be configured differently?'
      answer: |
       'The default maximum number of attempts to reconnect to an SMSC in Apache Camel''s SMPP component, when no negative bind response is received, is a substantial number (2147483647). However, this value can be configured differently if needed, as it is not set as a fixed limit.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the Apache Camel SMPP component''s reconnectDelay option, which defines the interval in milliseconds between reconnection attempts if a connection to the Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMSC) was lost, and how can it be configured during setup?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "reconnectDelay" option within the Apache Camel SMPP component is 5000 milliseconds (or 5 seconds). This setting determines the interval between reconnection attempts when a connection to the Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMSC) is lost. If you wish to configure a different interval, you can adjust it during setup as this option accepts integer values.'
    - question: 'What is the default splitting policy for the Apache Camel SMMP component and what are the other available options for handling long messages, along with their respective descriptions?'
      answer: |
       'The default splitting policy for the Apache Camel SMPP component is ALLOW, where long messages are split into 140 bytes per message as they are sent to the Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMSC). However, there are two other available options: TRUNCATE and REJECT. In the TRUNCATE policy, long messages are split and only the first fragment will be sent to the SMSC. This can reduce load on the SMPP connection since some carriers might drop subsequent fragments that won''t be delivered. The REJECT policy is used when a message would need to be split; in this case, the message is rejected with an SMPP NegativeResponseException and the reason code indicates that the message is too long.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "systemType" option in the Apache Camel SMPP component, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "systemType" option in the Apache Camel SMPP component is used to categorize the type of External Short Message Entity (ESME) that is binding to the Short Message Peer-to-Peer Protocol (SMSC). It can have a maximum of 13 characters. However, it does not have a default value. Using this option is optional when working with the SMPP component.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel SMPP component''s SmppConsumer to receive messages only from SMSCs that target a specific MSISDN or IP address range, as defined in section 5.2.7 of the SMPP 3.4 specification, and how do I know if this configuration is optional or has a default value?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel SMPP component''s SmppConsumer to receive messages only from SMSCs that target a specific MSISDN or IP address range as defined in section 5.2.7 of the SMPP 3.4 specification, you need to set the "addressRange" option for the SmppConsumer. This configuration is optional, meaning it''s not required if you want to receive messages from all SMSCs. However, there is no default value for this option, so you must explicitly provide a string representing your desired address range if you choose to use it.'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel SMPP component''s bridgeErrorHandler option work, and under what conditions is it possible for this feature to be utilized effectively?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) component''s bridgeErrorHandler option allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions, if possible, that occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.              However, it''s essential to note that this feature can only be effectively utilized when the 3rd party component allows Camel to be notified if an exception was thrown. Some components manage exceptions internally, so in such cases, the bridgeErrorHandler is not possible. In future releases, we may improve the Camel SMPP component to integrate with these components and make this feature viable.              By default, the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to handle exceptions, which log them at WARN or ERROR level and ignore them.'
    - question: 'What purpose does the "destAddr" option serve in the Apache Camel''s SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) component, when it is used for mobile terminated messages, and what type of data should be provided for this option? Also, is it mandatory to provide a value for this option and does it have a default value if no value is specified?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) component, the "destAddr" option defines the destination Short Message Entity (SME) address for mobile terminated messages. This corresponds to the directory number of the recipient Mobile Station (MS). It is essential to note that this option is applicable only for SubmitSm, SubmitMulti, CancelSm, and DataSm operations. The type of data you should provide for this option is a string. Although it''s not mandatory to provide a value, if no value is specified, the default value assigned is 1717.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible integer values for the Apache Camel SMPP component option "destAddrNpi" that defines the type of number to be used in the SME destination address parameters, and when should it be used (which message types)?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel SMPP component option "destAddrNpi" is null, meaning no default value is set. However, when using the options SubmitSm, SubmitMulti, CancelSm, and DataSm, this option defines the type of number (TON) to be used in the SME destination address parameters. The possible integer values for this option are:              * 0: Unknown       * 1: ISDN (E163/E164)       * 2: Data (X.121)       * 3: Telex (F.69)       * 6: Land Mobile (E.212)       * 8: National       * 9: Private       * 10: ERMES       * 13: Internet (IP)       * 18: WAP Client Id (to be defined by WAP Forum)'
    - question: 'What is the default and valid range for the `destAddrTon` option within the Apache Camel SMPP component when specifying the type of number (TON) to be used in the SubmitSm, SubmitMulti, CancelSm, and DataSm messages? And is it necessary to provide a value for this option if not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The `destAddrTon` option within the Apache Camel SMPP component does not have a default value. For the SubmitSm, SubmitMulti, CancelSm, and DataSm messages, it defines the type of number (TON) to be used in the SME destination address parameters. Valid TON values are 0: Unknown, 1: International, 2: National, 3: Network Specific, 4: Subscriber Number, 5: Alphanumeric, and 6: Abbreviated. While it is not required to provide a value for this option if none is specified, using a valid TON value can help improve message delivery accuracy in your communication system.'
    - question: 'In relation to the Apache Camel SMMP component, when should the lazySessionCreation option be enabled for avoiding exceptions if the Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMSC) is not available at the start of a producer? And what headers will Camel check to connect to the SMSC if the ''lazySessionCreation'' option is set to true and the necessary credentials are present?'
      answer: |
       'In relation to the Apache Camel SMMP component, the `lazySessionCreation` option should be enabled when you want to avoid exceptions that may occur if the Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMSC) is not available at the start of a producer. When this option is set to true and the producer starts without an active connection to the SMSC, Camel will check the inbound message headers ''CamelSmppSystemId'' and ''CamelSmppPassword'' of the first exchange. If these headers are present with the necessary credentials, Camel will use them to establish a connection with the SMSC when it becomes available.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel SMPP component affect the behavior of the producer, and what potential benefits and drawbacks are associated with this setting?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel SMPP component allows for a delayed start of the producer. This means that the producer will only be started when the first message is processed, rather than during the initial startup of the CamelContext and routes.              The primary benefit of this setting is that it can help avoid situations where a producer may fail during the startup process, potentially causing the entire route to fail being started. By deferring the startup failure to be handled during routing messages, you can make your application more resilient against such issues.              However, there is a trade-off to consider: when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. This could potentially impact the performance of your application if it frequently deals with high volumes of messages. Therefore, it''s crucial to weigh the potential benefits against any possible performance degradation before deciding whether or not to use this option.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of setting a value for the "messageReceiverRouteId" option in an Apache Camel SMMP producer, and what alternative endpoint should be used instead of an ''SMMP consumer'' if this option is set? (Hint: This feature is only tested with ''Direct consumer'' endpoint.)'
      answer: |
       'Setting a value for the "messageReceiverRouteId" option in an Apache Camel SMMP producer allows you to utilize the transceiver (TRX) binding type, eliminating the need to define an ''SMMP consumer'' endpoint. Instead, when this option is set, you should use a ''Direct consumer'' endpoint. Please note that this feature has only been tested with ''Direct consumer'' endpoints; the behavior with any other consumer type remains unknown and untested.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible valid integer values for the Apache Camel SMPP component''s numberingPlanIndicator option, and is it required when using this option in a producer group?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the numberingPlanIndicator option in the Apache Camel SMPP component is null. Valid integer values for this option include: 0 (Unknown), 1 (ISDN), 2 (Data), 3 (Telex), 6 (Land Mobile), 8 (National), 9 (Private), 10 (ERMES), 13 (Internet), 18 (WAP Client Id), and others that may be defined by specific groups or standards. It is not required to use this option when working with a producer group, but its inclusion can help specify the numeric plan indicator to be used in Short Message Entities (SMEs).'
    - question: 'What integer values does the Apache Camel SMPP component''s `priorityFlag` option support when assigning a priority level to a short message in the context of SubmitSm and SubmitMulti operations, and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel SMPP component''s `priorityFlag` option supports integer values ranging from 0 (Level 0, lowest priority) to 3 (Level 3, highest priority) when assigning a priority level to a short message in the context of SubmitSm and SubmitMulti operations. However, it''s important to note that the default value for this option is null, meaning no default priority is assigned unless explicitly set by the user.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "protocolId" option within the Apache Camel SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) component when it is not required, if any?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) component, the "protocolId" option represents the protocol identifier. When this option is not required, it has no default value. The "protocolId" option falls under the "producer" group of settings, suggesting that it might be used when configuring how messages are produced or sent via the SMPP protocol.'
    - question: 'What are the possible values for the "registeredDelivery" option in the Apache Camel SMPP component, and what does each value represent in terms of SMSC delivery receipt request? Furthermore, is there a default value for this option, and under which group can it be configured (producer)?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel SMPP component, the "registeredDelivery" option allows you to request an SMSC delivery receipt or SME originated acknowledgements. The possible values for this option are:              - 0: No SMSC delivery receipt is requested.       - 1: An SMSC delivery receipt is requested only when the final delivery outcome is either success or failure.       - 2: An SMSC delivery receipt is requested only when the final delivery outcome is delivery failure.              There is no default value for this option in the configuration. The "registeredDelivery" option can be configured under the "producer" group.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible valid values for the "replaceIfPresentFlag" option in the Apache Camel SMPP component, and when should it be set to replace an existing message during delivery?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "replaceIfPresentFlag" option in the Apache Camel SMPP component is null. However, valid values are defined as: 0 (Don''t replace) and 1 (Replace). This option should be set to 1 if you want the SMSC to replace a previously submitted message that is still pending delivery, provided that the source address, destination address, and service type match the same fields in the new message.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible values for the serviceType parameter in the Apache Camel SMMP component, if it is used to indicate the SMS Application service associated with the message? And is it required when configuring a producer?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `serviceType` parameter in the Apache Camel SMPP component, if used to indicate the SMS Application service associated with the message, is null. The possible values for this parameter are: CMT (Cellular Messaging), CPT (Cellular Paging), VMN (Voice Mail Notification), VMA (Voice Mail Alerting), WAP (Wireless Application Protocol), USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Services Data). When configuring a producer, the `serviceType` parameter is not required.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "sourceAddr" option in the Apache Camel SMMP producer component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "sourceAddr" option in the Apache Camel SMMP producer component defines the address of the Short Message Entity (SME) that originated the message. Its default value is "1616". Providing a value for this option is not mandatory as it has been designated as optional, meaning you can use other values or leave it empty if necessary, but keeping it for identifiability purposes in your messages might be beneficial.'
    - question: 'What are the valid Numeric Plan Indicator (NPI) values that can be set for the "sourceAddrNpi" option in the Apache Camel SMPP component when specifying the originator address parameters, and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel SMPP component, the valid Numeric Plan Indicator (NPI) values that can be set for the "sourceAddrNpi" option in the originator address parameters are:              * 0: Unknown       * 1: ISDN (E163/E164)       * 2: Data (X.121)       * 3: Telex (F.69)       * 6: Land Mobile (E.212)       * 8: National       * 9: Private       * 10: ERMES       * 13: Internet (IP)       * 18: WAP Client Id (to be defined by WAP Forum)              The default value for this option is null.'
    - question: 'What are the valid numeric values for the Apache Camel SMPP component''s "sourceAddrTon" option, and what is the default value?'
      answer: |
       'The valid numeric values for the "sourceAddrTon" option in the Apache Camel SMPP component are:       0: Unknown       1: International       2: National       3: Network Specific       4: Subscriber Number       5: Alphanumeric (not a numeric value, but still valid)       6: Abbreviated (not a numeric value, but still valid). The default value for this option is null.'
    - question: 'What are the valid integer values for the Apache Camel SMMP "typeOfNumber" option when defining the type of number (TON) to be used in a Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP) session, and is this setting optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'In an Apache Camel SMPP session, the valid integer values for the "typeOfNumber" option when defining the type of number (TON) are:       0: Unknown       1: International       2: National       3: Network Specific       4: Subscriber Number       5: Alphanumeric       6: Abbreviated       This setting is optional as it has a default value of null.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) component, and can this option be required or disabled if not needed?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option within the Apache Camel SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) component is a boolean setting, defaulting to true, that enables automatic autowiring for options. If marked as autowired, it allows Camel to look up in the registry for a single instance of matching type and configure the component accordingly, facilitating automatic configuration for components like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. This option can be disabled or not required if not needed, as indicated by its "required":false status and being part of the "advanced" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "configuration" option in the Apache Camel SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) component, and is it required for basic usage?'
      answer: |
       'The "configuration" option in the Apache Camel SMPP component serves to allow you to use a shared SmppConfiguration as your configuration. It doesn''t have a default value. Using this option is optional and falls under advanced settings, so it''s not required for basic usage of the component.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the Apache Camel SMPP component''s enquireLinkTimer option, and what does this option do in relation to the communication path between an ESME and an SMSC?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "enquireLinkTimer" option in the Apache Camel SMPP component is 60000 milliseconds (1 minute). This option defines the interval at which the confidence check is performed to test the communication path between an ESME (Short Message Peer-to-Peer Entity) and an SMSC (Short Message Service Center). The confidence check helps ensure that the connection between these entities remains active and functional.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the Apache Camel component SMMP''s "interfaceVersion" option, and which interface versions are allowed according to the SMPP protocol and the jSMPP library?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "interfaceVersion" option in the Apache Camel component SMMP is version 3.4. According to the SMPP protocol and the jSMPP library, allowed interface versions include legacy (0x00), 3.3 (0x33), 3.4 (0x34), and 5.0 (0x50).'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "pduProcessorDegree" option in the advanced settings group for the Apache Camel SMPP component, and can it be configured to handle multiple PDU messages concurrently?'
      answer: |
       'The "pduProcessorDegree" option in the advanced settings group for the Apache Camel SMPP component is a configuration that sets the number of threads which can read Protocol Data Units (PDUs) and process them in parallel. Its default value is 3, but it can be configured to handle multiple PDU messages concurrently if desired. This option is optional and not required for basic functionality.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible data type for the configuration option "pduProcessorQueueCapacity" in the Apache Camel SMPP component, and is it required when configuring this component? (Answer: The default value is 100, and it accepts integer values. It''s an optional configuration.)'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the configuration option "pduProcessorQueueCapacity" in the Apache Camel SMPP component is 100, with data type being an integer. It''s an optional configuration, meaning you don''t necessarily need to set it when configuring this component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the ''sessionStateListener'' option within the Apache Camel SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) component, and how can I configure it to listen for callbacks when the session state changes?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of the Apache Camel SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) component, the ''sessionStateListener'' option is intended for receiving callbacks whenever there is a change in the session state. This can be achieved by referring to an instance of org.jsmpp.session.SessionStateListener within your component''s configuration in Camel Registry.              While it''s not required, you can configure ''sessionStateListener'' to listen for these callbacks if you need to implement custom behavior or handling when the session state changes. To do so, you would typically create a class that implements org.jsmpp.session.SessionStateListener and then register an instance of this class within your Camel route or blueprint configuration.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "singleDLR" option in the Apache Camel SMPP component affect the delivery receipt behavior for multi-segment and single-segment messages? Can you explain the default value, possible values, and requirements for this option?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "singleDLR" option in the Apache Camel SMPP component changes the delivery receipt behavior primarily for multi-segment (long) messages. When set to true, the SMSC will only be requested to send a delivery receipt for the final segment of such messages. For single-segment messages, which are considered short messages, the default behavior remains unaltered. The default value of this option is false. It accepts boolean values and is classified as an advanced feature due to its specific use case, as it''s not required in all scenarios.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the transactionTimer option in the Apache Camel SMPP component, and is it a required configuration setting? Additionally, in which group can this option be found within the advanced configuration options for the SMPP component?'
      answer: |
       'The "transactionTimer" option in the Apache Camel SMPP component defines a maximum period of inactivity after a transaction, beyond which an SMPP entity may assume that the session is no longer active. Its default value is 10000 milliseconds (or 10 seconds). This timer can be active on either the SMSC or ESME entity, and its use is not required. The "transactionTimer" option can be found within the ''advanced'' configuration group for the SMPP component.'
    - question: 'What is the default encoding option for the alphabet in the Apache Camel SMPP component and what are the available encoding options according to the SMPP 3.4 specification, section 5.2.19?'
      answer: |
       'The default encoding option for the alphabet in the Apache Camel SMPP component is not explicitly set (defaultValue: null). However, according to the SMPP 3.4 specification, section 5.2.19, there are three available options:              1. 0: SMSC Default Alphabet       2. 4: 8 bit Alphabet       3. 8: UCS2 Alphabet              You can choose one of these encoding options when working with the alphabet in the SMPP component as per your requirement. The "codec" group contains related configurations for setting up these options.'
    - question: 'What are the possible data codings for SMPP in Apache Camel''s SMTP component, and what is the default value of the "dataCoding" option?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel''s SMMP component, the possible data codings according to the SMPP 3.4 specification are defined under section 5.2.19. These include:              * SMSC Default Alphabet (0)       * Latin 1 (ISO-8859-1) (3)       * Octet unspecified (8-bit binary) (4)       * UCS2 (ISO/IEC-10646) (8)       * Extended Kanji JIS(X 0212-1990) (13)              However, it''s important to note that the default value of the "dataCoding" option is null in this context. You may need to set this option according to your specific requirements when configuring the SMMP component. The group associated with this option is "codec".'
    - question: 'What is the default encoding scheme used in the Short Message User Data when using Apache Camel''s SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) component for SubmitSm, ReplaceSm, and SubmitMulti operations, and can this encoding be changed if desired?'
      answer: |
       'The default encoding scheme used in the Short Message User Data when employing Apache Camel''s SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) component for SubmitSm, ReplaceSm, and SubmitMulti operations is ISO-8859-1. However, if desired, this encoding can be changed as the "encoding" option in the SMPP component allows you to define a different encoding scheme. This setting falls under the "codec" group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel component "smpp" option named "httpProxyHost", and is it a required field? Also, where does this option belong in terms of usage groups within Camel''s configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "httpProxyHost" option for the Apache Camel SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) component is designed to configure an HTTP proxy server if you need to tunnel your SMPP connections through one. The default value for this attribute is not set, meaning it can be left blank if no proxy is required. This attribute is of type string and is not a mandatory field, as indicated by the "required" being false. You will find this option grouped under the "proxy" settings in Camel''s configuration, signifying its purpose in relation to network proxies.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel component SMPP option named "httpProxyPassword", and is it required when using the SMPP component?'
      answer: |
       'The purpose of the Apache Camel component SMPP option named "httpProxyPassword" is to provide the password for an HTTP proxy that requires basic authentication, in case you need to use one with your SMPP operations. However, it''s important to note that this attribute has a default value of null, meaning that if no specific password is provided, no password will be used by default. Additionally, setting a password for this option is not required when using the SMPP component, as its use is optional under the "proxy" group of attributes.'
    - question: 'What is the default port number for the HTTP Proxy used with the Apache Camel SMPP component when tunneling SMPP through a HTTP proxy, and is it necessary to set this attribute if I''m not using an HTTP Proxy?'
      answer: |
       'The default port number for the HTTP Proxy used with the Apache Camel SMPP component when tunneling SMPP through a HTTP proxy is 3128, as per its default configuration. However, if you''re not using an HTTP Proxy, it is not necessary to set this attribute.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "httpProxyUsername" option in Apache Camel''s SMPP component, and is it required or optional? Additionally, what type of data should be provided if it needs to be set, and under what circumstances would it be necessary to do so?'
      answer: |
       'The "httpProxyUsername" option in Apache Camel''s SMPP component is intended for situations where your HTTP proxy requires basic authentication. If such a requirement exists for your proxy setup, you can set this attribute with the username required for your specific HTTP proxy. It is an optional attribute, meaning it is not always necessary to provide a value for it. The type of data that should be provided if it needs to be set is a string representing the username for authentication. This would typically be used when your requests through the SMPP component need to pass through an HTTP proxy that requires credentials for access.'
    - question: 'How is it possible to configure Apache Camel''s SMPP component to send additional headers to the proxy server when establishing a connection, and what is the default value for this configuration option?'
      answer: |
       'To configure Apache Camel''s SMPP component to send additional headers to the proxy server while establishing a connection, you can utilize the "proxyHeaders" option. This option allows you to specify an object containing the headers that will be forwarded to the proxy server. The default value for this configuration option is null.'

    - question: 'What is the default splitting policy for the Apache Camel SMTP component when sending large messages, and how does each available option (ALLOW, TRUNCATE, REJECT) affect the behavior of message splitting and delivery?'
      answer: |
       'The default splitting policy for the Apache Camel SMPP component when sending large messages is ALLOW. In this mode, long messages are split into fragments of 140 bytes each. If you choose to use the TRUNCATE option, long messages will be split and only the first fragment will be sent to the Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMSC). This reduces load on the SMPP connection by not sending parts of a message that may never be delivered due to some carriers dropping subsequent fragments. Lastly, if you select the REJECT option, messages that would need to be split will be rejected with an SMPP NegativeResponseException and the reason code signifying the message is too long.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "systemType" parameter in the Apache Camel SMPP component, and is it required when using this component? Additionally, can you provide a brief description of what an ESME and SMSC are within this context?'

    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel SMPP component''s bridgeErrorHandler option function when it is enabled, and under what conditions is it possible to utilize this feature in a Camel route?'
      answer: |
       'When the Apache Camel SMPP component''s `bridgeErrorHandler` option is enabled, it enables bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions (if possible) that occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.              However, it''s important to note that this feature is only possible if the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. Some components handle exceptions internally only, and therefore `bridgeErrorHandler` is not possible in such cases. In situations where we can hook into the 3rd party component, we may improve the Camel component to make this possible for future releases.              By default, the consumer will use the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler` to deal with exceptions, which will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. If you choose not to use the `bridgeErrorHandler`, exceptions will not be processed as messages and will follow their default handling behavior.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the exceptionHandler option in the Apache Camel SMPP component, when using it with a custom ExceptionHandler, and what happens if this option is not used or set to its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The `exceptionHandler` option in the Apache Camel SMPP component allows you to utilize a custom ExceptionHandler. If the `bridgeErrorHandler` option is enabled, using `exceptionHandler` is not applicable. By default, exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level will be handled by the consumer, and ignored. When you do not use or set `exceptionHandler` to its default value, the component''s default behavior for handling exceptions will apply.'
