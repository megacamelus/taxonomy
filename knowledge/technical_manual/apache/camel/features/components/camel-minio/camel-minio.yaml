seed_examples:
    - question: '"What is the default setting for the autoCreation of a MinIO bucket in Apache Camel, and is it necessary to set this option if I already have the bucket in place?"'
      answer: |
       'The default setting for the autocreation of a MinIO bucket in Apache Camel is true, meaning that if a bucket with the specified name does not exist, it will be automatically created. However, since you mention having the bucket already in place, it''s not necessary to set this option explicitly as it will have no effect in your situation.'
    - question: 'What is the default and optional nature, as well as the type of object for the configuration option in the Apache Camel Minio component?'
      answer: |
       'The configuration option in the Apache Camel Minio component is an optional object type, with no default value. This means you can choose whether to provide a configuration or not, and when provided, it should be in an object format as specified by the ''type'' attribute. The ''groups'' attribute indicates that this configuration falls under the common group of settings, which typically includes options that apply across multiple usage scenarios with this component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and format of the Apache Camel MinIO endpoint option when using it in a route, and is its use mandatory? (Answer: The Apache Camel MinIO endpoint can be an URL, domain name, IPv4 address, or IPv6 address, and its usage is not mandatory.)'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel MinIO endpoint option serves as a configuration for specifying the location of your MinIO server, which can take the format of a URL, domain name, IPv4 address, or even an IPv6 address. The use of this option is not mandatory; you can skip it if you prefer to set up other means of data transfer in your Camel route.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "minioClient" option within the Apache Camel component called "minio", and does it have a default value or is its use optional (and if so, under which group of options)?'
      answer: |
       'The "minioClient" option within the Apache Camel component "minio" is a reference to an instance of a Minio Client object in your registry. It provides a way for you to interact with a Minio server using the SDK methods. This option is optional, as indicated by its "required" property being false. Its use falls under the group of options called "common". By default, it has no predefined value, meaning you will need to provide your own instance if you choose to utilize this feature.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for setting MinIO''s objectLock feature when creating a new bucket in Apache Camel, and is it required to set this option?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for enabling MinIO''s object lock feature when creating a new bucket in Apache Camel is false, and it is not required to set this option as it has a non-mandatory status within the common groups.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "policy" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component, and is it mandatory for configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "policy" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component serves to define a policy for a specific queue. However, it doesn''t have a default value (defaultValue: null). Its inclusion during configuration is optional as indicated by the "required": false attribute. It falls under the common group of options for easy identification within your configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the default value of the `proxyPort` option in the Apache Camel Minio component and is it necessary to set this option when using the Minio library with a Camel route?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `proxyPort` option in the Apache Camel Minio component is not defined (null). When using the Minio library within a Camel route, setting this option is optional as defaults of 80 and 443 are used for HTTP and HTTPS respectively.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "region" option in the Apache Camel Minio component, and how should it be properly specified if used?'
      answer: |
       'The "region" option in the Apache Camel Minio component is designed to specify the geographical location where your Minio client operates. If you choose to use this parameter, the configuration expects a lowercase region name (e.g., ap-east-1). For correct usage, you should use the ID of the Region, for instance, Region.EU_WEST_1.id(). Please note that using the "region" option is optional as it has no default value provided in the configuration by default. This parameter falls under the common group of configurations within Apache Camel Minio component.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "secure" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component, and is it required to be set when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "secure" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component is false, meaning a non-secure connection will be used unless explicitly overridden. However, it''s not a required setting when using this component.'
    - question: '"What is the default behavior of the ''autoCloseBody'' option in the Apache Camel component for minio when both ''includeBody'' is set to true and this ''autoCloseBody'' option itself? Also, what happens if ''autoCloseBody'' is set to false under the same conditions?"'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component for Minio, if both ''includeBody'' is set to true and the ''autoCloseBody'' option is concerned, the default behavior is that the ''MinioObject.close()'' method will be automatically called upon exchange completion. However, if ''autoCloseBody'' is explicitly set to false under these conditions, it becomes the caller''s responsibility to close the MinioObject stream manually.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component facilitate exception handling, compared to the default exception handling method when this option is disabled?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component facilitates exceptional handling by allowing exceptions that occur while the MinIO consumer attempts to pick up incoming messages to be processed as a message instead of being ignored or logged. This means they will be handled by the Camel routing Error Handler, providing a more flexible and customizable error management approach compared to the default exception handling method when this option is disabled, where exceptions are logged at WARN or ERROR level and then ignored. However, it''s important to note that this functionality may not be available for all 3rd party components, as some may handle exceptions internally only, in which case bridgeErrorHandler is not possible. This feature can potentially be improved in future releases of the Camel component by better integrating with third-party systems to allow bridgeErrorHandler functionality for a wider range of components.'
    - question: 'How does setting the "bypassGovernanceMode" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component influence the deletion of an object, and is it mandatory to set this flag? (Also, provide details on its default value and data type.)'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "bypassGovernanceMode" option to true in the Apache Camel MinIO component allows you to bypass the governance mode when deleting a specific object. This means that even if the governance mode is enabled on your MinIO server, the specified object will be deleted without checking for any retention rules or policies. However, it''s not mandatory to set this flag; its default value is false. The "bypassGovernanceMode" option accepts a boolean data type within the consumer group of configurations.'
    - question: 'Here is a question related to the Apache Camel MinIO component''s deleteAfterRead option:              What is the purpose of setting the `deleteAfterRead` option to true when using the MinIO consumer component in Apache Camel, and under what circumstances will an object not be deleted if this option is used? Furthermore, can you explain the use-case for using the Idempotent Consumer Endpoint Interceptor (EIP) with the deleteAfterRead option and why it might be necessary to filter based on the MinioConstants#BUCKET_NAME and MinioConstants#OBJECT_NAME headers or just the MinioConstants#OBJECT_NAME header?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the Apache Camel MinIO component, setting the `deleteAfterRead` option to true indicates that objects retrieved from a Minio bucket will be automatically deleted after they have been read. This is useful for preventing unnecessary storage when dealing with transient data. However, it''s important to note that an object will not be deleted if a rollback occurs in the Exchange (a mechanism that allows processing steps within a route to undo their changes).              The Idempotent Consumer Endpoint Interceptor (EIP) becomes necessary when you want to prevent duplicate processing of the same object due to retries or errors. This is especially crucial when `deleteAfterRead` is set to true, as repeatedly retrieving and deleting the same object can lead to unnecessary operations and potential data loss.              The Idempotent Consumer EIP allows you to filter out duplicates by examining headers such as MinioConstants#BUCKET_NAME and MininoConstants#OBJECT_NAME, or just the MinioConstants#OBJECT_NAME header. By comparing these headers with the values of previously processed messages, the EIP can ensure that only unique objects are processed within your Camel route, thus avoiding unnecessary reads and deletions.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delimiter" option when using the Minio component in Apache Camel, and is it a required configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "delimiter" option in the Minio component of Apache Camel serves a purpose to segment the responses returned by the ListObjectsRequest in a specific way, allowing you to only consume objects that are of interest to your application. By default, it doesn''t have an assigned value (null). Its inclusion is optional within your configuration since its usage may vary depending on the nature and organization of your data stored in Minio. This option falls under the "consumer" group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and optional nature (default value, data type, group association) of the "destinationBucketName" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component used in consumer groups?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s MinIO component within consumer groups, the "destinationBucketName" option serves as a label for the target bucket where data will be written or stored. It is an optional parameter with no default value (defaultValue: null), meaning you must explicitly specify it if needed. This option expects a string input (type: string) to match your desired bucket name in MinIO. The group association here is "consumer", signifying that this configuration applies to consumer-oriented usages of the MinIO component in Apache Camel routing scenarios.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the optional "destinationObjectName" parameter in the Apache Camel MinIO component, and can it be considered as a required configuration option?'
      answer: |
       'The "destinationObjectName" parameter in the Apache Camel MinIO component is an optional setting, serving as the name for the target object during data transfer to or from an Amazon S3-compatible object storage system like MinIO. By default, it does not have a preset value, allowing you flexibility when configuring your data transfer tasks. Since this parameter is marked as "optional" and "defaultValue": null, it''s considered non-required for configuration purposes in the context of the consumer group.'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel "includeBody" option in the MinIO component behave when set to false compared to its default value (true) in terms of the exchange body and Minio object metadata, and how is the "autocloseBody" option related to this setting?'
      answer: |
       'When you set the Apache Camel "includeBody" option in the MinIO component to false compared to its default value (true), the exchange body will be null instead of containing the contents of the file. In contrast, if it is set to true, the exchange body will be a stream to the contents of the file. Regarding the "autocloseBody" option, it''s related in that setting includeBody to true and autocloseBody to false means that you are responsible for closing the MinIOObject stream, whereas setting autocloseBody to true will close the MinIOObject stream automatically.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "includeFolders" option in the Apache Camel Minio component, and is it mandatory for using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "includeFolders" option in the Apache Camel Minio component serves the purpose of deciding whether to include folders in the ListObjectsRequest or not. By default, its value is set to false, meaning it does not include folders unless explicitly specified. It''s not mandatory for using the Minio component; you can use the Minio component without setting this option if it suits your specific requirements better.'
    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the "includeUserMetadata" option in the Minio component of Apache Camel affect the behavior when listing objects in a Minio storage service, and what is its default value and data type?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "includeUserMetadata" option in the Minio component of Apache Camel will modify the behavior when listing objects in a Minio storage service to include objects with their associated user metadata. This flag is optional, meaning it''s not necessary to use it if you don''t require user metadata in the response. However, its default value is false, indicating that when not explicitly set, it won''t return user metadata along with the objects. The "includeUserMetadata" option takes a boolean data type.'
    - question: 'How can I use the ''includeVersions'' option in the Apache Camel Minio component to retrieve objects with versioning when making a list request? Is there a default value for this option and is it required when using the consumer group?'
      answer: |
       'To include versions while making a list request with the Apache Camel Minio component, you can utilize the ''includeVersions'' flag in your ListObjectsRequest object. By setting this flag to true, you will retrieve objects with versioning. Please note that by default, the value of ''includeVersions'' is false; so if you wish to use it, you should explicitly set it to true. Additionally, while using the consumer group, inclusion of the ''includeVersions'' option is optional, not mandatory.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and group affiliation (if any) of the Apache Camel MinIO component option named "length"?'
      answer: |
       'The "length" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component is designed to specify the number of bytes of object data starting from a given offset. Its default value is null, meaning no specific offset is set by default. Regarding data type, it''s an integer. This option is not marked as required, so it can be omitted if not needed. Lastly, this option falls under the consumer group in terms of its function within the overall MinIO component setup.'
    - question: 'How can I set the optional ''matchETIf'' parameter using a string value for the Apache Camel MinIO component while performing a ''get object(s)'' operation? Is there any default value for this option in Camel context?'
      answer: |
       'To set the optional ''matchETag'' parameter using a string value for the Apache Camel MinIO component during a ''get object(s)'' operation, you can configure it within your Camel route by specifying the property as follows:              ```       .property("minio.matchETag", "your_desired_string_value")       ...       .from("minio://your-endpoint?accessKey=your_access_key&secretKey=your_secret_key&region=us-west-1&matchETag={{ minio.matchETag }}")       ```              It''s important to note that this option, ''matchETag'', has no default value by default in the Camel context. You should provide a specific string value as required if you wish to use it when performing a ''get object(s)'' operation with the MinIO component.'
    - question: 'What is the default maximum number of connections that can be set for the Apache Camel MinIO consumer component using the "maxConnections" option, if this value is not explicitly specified?'
      answer: |
       'The default maximum number of connections for the Apache Camel MinIO consumer component, when not explicitly specified using the "maxConnections" option, is 60 connections.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and allowed ranges (including if it can be set to an unlimited number of messages) for the "maxMessagesPerPoll" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component when used within the consumer group?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "maxMessagesPerPoll" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component, when used within the consumer group, is 10. It allows an integer value that can be adjusted to limit the number of messages polled at each polling. You can set it as unlimited by using 0 or a negative number.'
    - question: 'How do you configure the modifiedSince option in the Apache Camel MinIO component when using it as a consumer, and is it mandatory to set this option?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using Apache Camel''s MinIO component as a consumer, setting the "modifiedSince" option can be configured, but it is not mandatory. The "modifiedSince" parameter is used for filtering objects based on their last modification date when retrieving them with the get object(s) operation. If you wish to set this option, you would do so during the component''s configuration within your Apache Camel route. However, if no value is specified for this option, it will default to null, which means that all objects are considered for retrieval, regardless of their last modification time.'
    - question: 'What is the functionality and usage of the "moveAfterRead" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component, particularly focusing on when and under what conditions it moves objects between buckets?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s MinIO component, the "moveAfterRead" option enables moving objects from one bucket to another after they have been retrieved. This operation requires setting the destinationBucket option in your code for specifying the target bucket where the moved object will reside.              It is essential to understand that this copy operation occurs only when the Exchange is committed. In other words, if a transaction rollback happens during processing, the object does not get transferred. By default, this feature is turned off, but you can enable it by setting its value to true if required. It falls under the "consumer" group of options for your convenience in managing component settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "notMatchETag" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component and what type of value does it accept, if specified? Is it required or optional, and under which group can this option be found in the consumer configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "notMatchETag" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component is designed to control whether an object should be retrieved even when its ETag (Entity Tag) does not match the expected value. If you set this option to a string value, it will be interpreted as such. It is an optional configuration parameter and can be found under the "consumer" group in the MinIO component settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "objectName" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component, and is it required or optional when using this component as a consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The "objectName" option within the Apache Camel MinIO component serves the purpose of specifying the unique name of the object to be retrieved from the defined MinIO bucket. It doesn''t have a default value, meaning you must provide an object name explicitly. Using this option is optional, so when acting as a consumer with the MinIO component, you can choose whether or not to supply an object name for its functionality.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it is a required option for using the offset feature in the Apache Camel Minio component when configured as a consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The "offset" option in the Apache Camel Minio component, functioning as a consumer, serves to indicate the starting byte position of an object''s data within a file system. It has no default value (defaultValue: null). The data type for this option is integer. While not mandatory to use (required: false), you can specify it if needed to control the start point from where the object data will be processed. This feature pertains to the consumer group, meaning it influences how Camel interacts with Minio as a data consumer.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''prefix'' option in the Apache Camel MinIO component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option when configuring a consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The ''prefix'' option in the Apache Camel MinIO component serves to specify that an object name in the MinIO storage should start with a specified prefix. However, providing a value for this option is not mandatory, as indicated by its default value of null and the ''required: false'' setting. So, when configuring a consumer using this component, you can choose whether to supply a prefix or not according to your specific needs within the "consumer" group of configurations.'
    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the "recursive" option in the Apache Camel Minio component impact the behavior when consuming data from an Amazon S3-like object storage service?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "recursive" option in the Apache Camel Minio component while consuming data from an Amazon S3-like object storage service allows for a recursive listing of the directory structure. In other words, it will traverse through all subdirectories beneath the specified source directory, emulating the behavior of a deep directory listing, just like how you would list files in an actual file system. When this option is disabled (its default state), Camel Minio only lists files and directories in the specific directory provided, without diving into subdirectories.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel MinIO component to start listing objects from a specific object name after the currently processed one, if it''s not required?'
      answer: |
       'To start listing objects from a specific object name after the currently processed one with the Apache CamEL MinIO component, you can set the "startAfter" option when configuring the component. This option allows for resumable object listings in the bucket. You don''t need to specify a default value since it''s optional. Here''s an example of how to use it:              ```       minioComponent()           .host("your-minio-host")           .accessKey("your-access-key")           .secretKey("your-secret-key")           .region("us-west-1")           .bucket("your-bucket-name")           .startAfter("specificObjectName");       ```              Keep in mind that the "startAfter" option is part of the consumer group, so it only affects how CamEL consumes from the MinIO component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''unModifiedSince'' option in the Apache Camel MinIO component, what is its default value, and is it mandatory or optional to set this option when using the consumer group?'
      answer: |
       'The ''unModifiedSince'' option within the Apache Camel MinIO component is designed to allow you to set the unmodified since parameter for the get object(s) operation. Its default value is null, meaning it does not have a predefined value. It is an optional setting, as indicated by the "required": false in its definition, and can be left unset when using the consumer group if there is no specific need to use it during data retrieval from MinIO storage.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel MinIO component option named "useVersion1"? Also, is it required for the configuration and which group does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel MinIO component option named "useVersion1" serves the purpose of specifying whether version 1 of the REST API should be used when communicating with a MinIO service. By default, this option is set to false, meaning that a different version of the REST API will be used. The option is not required for configuration as it can be left as its default value if not explicitly specified. This option falls under the "consumer" group in the Camel configuration context.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "versionId" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component when deleting an object, and is its use mandatory or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "versionId" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component, when deleting an object, allows you to specify a particular version ID of the object. If no specific version ID is set (the default value is null), all versions of the object will be deleted. Using this option is optional, as its setting is not required for object deletion.'
    - question: 'What is the function and default value of the Apache Camel Minio producer option named "deleteAfterWrite"?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel Minio producer option "deleteAfterWrite" is designed to automatically delete a file object after it has been successfully uploaded using the Minio service. Its default value is false, meaning that files will not be automatically deleted unless explicitly set to true in the configuration. This option belongs to the ''producer'' group of settings, providing flexibility for handling file operations in your application.'
    - question: 'How is it possible to set a specific key name for an element when using the Apache Camel MinIO producer, and is it required? (Also, what data type should this option have?)'
      answer: |
       'To set a specific key name for an element when utilizing the Apache Camel MinIO producer, you can make use of the "keyName" option in the component''s configuration. This option allows you to assign a custom key name for each element placed into your MinIO bucket via the endpoint parameter. However, setting the key name is not a required step, as the system will default to automatically generating keys if no explicit keyName is provided.       The type of data this option should have is "string", meaning it accepts alphanumeric characters and special symbols commonly found in URLs.'
    - question: 'How does setting the Apache Camel component MinIO''s "lazyStartProducer" option to true affect the behavior of a Camel route, and why might this be useful for preventing initial startup failures?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the Apache Camel component MinIO''s "lazyStartProducer" option to true allows the producer to be deferred during the initial startup of a CamelContext and its associated routes. This lazy start behavior can help prevent situations where the producer might fail during the start-up process, thereby causing the entire route to fail. By starting the producer lazily, the failure during startup can instead be handled via Camel''s routing error handlers. However, be aware that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take extra time, which could prolong the total processing time of the processing. This feature might be particularly useful in scenarios where you anticipate potential difficulties while configuring or initializing a producer, allowing for a smoother startup experience and minimizing failures.'
    - question: 'What are the available operation options within the Apache Camel MinIO producer component if a user chooses not to just perform an upload operation? (Given that the option is named "operation" and doesn''t have a default value, and it is one of the optional parameters in the producer group.)'
      answer: |
       'If you are using the Apache Camel MinIO producer component and do not wish to just perform an upload operation, there are other available operations within the "operation" option. Although this option does not have a default value by default, it provides flexibility for various data manipulations besides uploading. These operations are optional and belong to the "producer" group in Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of using the "pojoRequest" option within the Apache Camel Minio component when setting up a producer? Does it require a specific group for configuration, and if so, which one is it?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for using the "pojoRequest" option within the Apache Camel Minio component when setting up a producer is false. This option determines whether to use a POJO request as the body of the request. When set to true, it allows you to pass a Java Plain Old Java Object (POJO) as the payload instead of JSON or XML. It does not require a specific group for configuration; however, it belongs to the "producer" group which signifies that it''s relevant for producer-related configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, type, and whether it''s required for the Apache Camel Minio component option named "storageClass"? Also, can you explain where this option falls within the Minio producer group?              Answer: The storage class option in the Apache Camel Minio component allows users to set a specific storage class in the request. Its default value is null, meaning no storage class is set by default if not specified. The type of this option is string. Although it''s not required, it belongs to the producer group, specifically related to the settings for producers in Camel Minio integration.'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s Minio component, the storage class option (under "component":"minio" and "option":"storageClass") serves as a means for users to specify a particular storage class within their request. This option is not mandatory as its default value is set to null, implying that no specific storage class will be applied if it''s left unspecified. The data type for this option is string. It should be noted that the storageClass option falls under the "producer" group in terms of Minio integration, pertaining to the settings related to producers within Camel''s Minio module.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "autowiredEnabled" option within the Apache Camel Minio component, and are there any scenarios where setting it to false might be useful?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Minio component is set to a default value of true, and it determines whether autowiring is enabled for automatic configuration of certain components such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. When set to true, it allows Camel to look up in the registry to find a single instance of matching type. However, setting this option to false could be useful in scenarios where you want to explicitly configure each instance manually, providing more control over how these components are utilized within your Camel routes.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "customHttpClient" option within the Apache Camel MinIO component, and does it have a default value or is its use optional? Also, in which group (basic, intermediate, advanced) is this option typically found?'
      answer: |
       'The "customHttpClient" option within the Apache Camel MinIO component allows you to set a custom HTTP client for authenticated access to your Minio storage service. This feature enables you to utilize a specific HTTP client instance, such as a custom-configured one, to handle communication with the Minio server. It does not have a default value and its use is optional, being categorized under the advanced group in Camel configuration options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel MinIO component option "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" and does it have a default value, as well as which group it belongs to in terms of options?'
      answer: |
       'The option "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" in the Apache Camel MinIO component is utilized for controlling whether all consumer-based health checks are enabled or disabled from this specific component. It''s a boolean type, with a default value of true. In terms of groups, it belongs to the group labeled as "health".'
    - question: 'Given the information provided, here''s a question that could be asked about the Apache Camel component "minio" and its option "healthCheckProducerEnabled":              "What is the purpose of the ''healthCheckProducerEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel ''minio'' component, what is its default value, and when should it be set to false if not desired?"'
      answer: |
       'The purpose of the ''healthCheckProducerEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel ''minio'' component is for enabling or disabling all producer-based health checks from this component. By default, its value is true, indicating that all producer checks are enabled. However, if you wish to disable these checks, you can set it to false, although Camel has by default disabled all producer-based health-checks.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "accessKey" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component, and can it be left as null or does it require a specific value? Additionally, what type of data should be provided if a value is assigned to this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessKey" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component serves as an Amazon AWS Secret Access Key or a Minio Access Key. If you choose not to set it, Camel will connect to the service for anonymous access. However, if you assign a value to this option, it should be a string type of your specific Access Key (either AWS or Minio). This group falls under "security."'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "secretKey" option within the Apache Camel component named "minio", and what value should be provided if I want to use it for authentication rather than anonymous access?'
      answer: |
       'The "secretKey" option within the Apache Camel component "minio" is intended for providing an Access Key Id (or Minio Secret Key) that serves as your authentication credential, allowing you to securely access your MinIO server. If you wish to use it for authentication instead of anonymous access, you should provide your MinIO access key or secret key value in the "secretKey" field when configuring this component.'
    - question: 'How is the server-side encryption option (`serverSideEncryption`) within the Apache Camel MinIO component configured, if it is not a required setting? Does it have a default value and which group does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The server-side encryption option (`serverSideEncryption`) in the Apache Camel MinIO component is optional, meaning you don''t necessarily need to set it for usage. It doesn''t have a default value, so if not provided, it will not be applied during data transfer. This setting belongs to the security group, indicating its purpose is to enhance the secure handling of your data within this component.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the server-side encryption customer key when using the MinIO component in Apache Camel to encrypt source objects during copy or move operations, if you choose to do so? Is there a default value for this configuration option?'
      answer: |
       'To configure server-side encryption with a customer key (SSE-C) when using the MinIO component in Apache Camel for encrypting source objects during copy or move operations, you can set the "serverSideEncryptionCustomerKey" option. This configuration is found under the "security" group and it''s optional, as indicated by the "required:false". Unfortunately, there is no default value for this option, so you will need to specify your own customer key when using it. Here''s a simple example of how to set it up in Camel:              ```java       MinioComponent minioComponent = new MinioComponent();       minioComponent.serverSideEncryptionCustomerKey("<Your-Customer-Key>");       ...       producerTemplate.createProducer(myRoute);       ```              Make sure to replace `<Your-Customer-Key>` with your actual encryption key for the MinIO bucket you''re working on.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and required nature for the Apache Camel Minio option "autoCreateBucket" when using the MinIO component, and can this option be configured to manage bucket creation in cases where a specified bucket does not exist?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "autoCreateBucket" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component is true, which means that if a bucket with the specified name does not exist, it will automatically be created. This setting can be configured to manage bucket creation, making it optional (since the default value is set to true but it can be false as well) within the group of common settings in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the data type, description, and whether it''s required for the Apache Camel Minio component endpoint option when using it in a route?'
      answer: |
       'The data type of the "endpoint" option within the Apache Camel Minio component is a string. It describes an URL, domain name, IPv4 address, or IPv6 address. Whether this option is required is indicated as false, meaning that you can optionally provide an endpoint value in your route configuration. The "endpoint" option belongs to the common group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "minioClient" option within the Apache Camel component "minio", and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option when using the component? Furthermore, where can this "Minio Client object in the registry" be found or created if not provided by default?'
      answer: |
       'The "minioClient" option within the Apache Camel component "minio" is an optional reference to a Minio Client object in the registry. This Minio Client object is used for interaction with the Minio server. If you don''t provide a value for this option, it will not be set by default.              To find or create the Minio Client object in the registry (Apache Camel context), you would typically instantiate a new MinioClient instance, configure it with your Minio server details (access key, secret key, endpoint URL, etc.) and then register this instance under a name in the Camel context. This way, when using the minio component, you can reference the registered Minio Client object using the "minioClient" option.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and requirement for the Apache Camel MinIO component option called "objectLock" when creating a new bucket, and can its value be specified if not required?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel MinIO component option named "objectLock" when creating a new bucket is false. If it''s not necessary to set this option (it is optional), you can still specify its value as desired, since it has been marked as non-required.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "policy" option when using the Apache Camel component called MinIO, and is it a required configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "policy" option for the Apache Camel MinIO component serves as the policy to be set for a specific queue during operations. This option is not mandatory, meaning it''s allowed but not required in your configuration. By default, there is no predefined value for this option, which implies that you need to provide your own policy string when setting it up.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "proxyPort" option in the Apache Camel Minio component, and is it required when using this component? (The provided information suggests that no default value is given, it can accept an integer value if provided, and it''s not a mandatory field.)'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel Minio component, the "proxyPort" option does not have a default value. It is intended to specify the TCP/IP port number for HTTP or HTTPS communication. Commonly, ports 80 and 443 are used for HTTP and HTTPS respectively. However, you may assign a different integer value if needed, though it''s important to note that providing this option is not mandatory when using this component in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "region" option in the Apache Camel Minio component, including how it should be formatted, any default value or requirement for its use, and the applicable group in the common options?'
      answer: |
       'The "region" option in the Apache Camel Minio component specifies the region where the Minio client will operate. It expects a lowercase string representing the region, such as ''ap-east-1'' or ''Region.EU_WEST_1.id()''. Although there is no default value, its usage is optional. You can find this option in the common group of settings, which includes general configuration options that apply broadly across components.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "secure" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "secure" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component is a flag that determines whether to use a secure connection (HTTPS) or not (HTTP) to the Minio service. Its default value is false, meaning it will not be using a secure connection by default. It is an optional parameter; therefore, you can choose to provide it when using this component in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of setting the "autoCloseBody" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component to true or false, and under what circumstances would it be advisable to let the system automatically close the MinioObject stream (i.e., when set to true) compared to manually closing it (i.e., when set to false)?'
      answer: |
       'When using the Apache Camel MinIO component, setting the "autoCloseBody" option determines whether the MinioObject.close() method is called automatically upon exchange completion or not. If you set it to true and also use the "includeBody" option, the MinioObject stream will be closed automatically after the exchange is completed. This can be advantageous as it prevents potential memory leaks or other resource issues by ensuring the stream is always properly closed. However, when both "includeBody" and "autoCloseBody" are set to true, you have the flexibility to manually close the MinioObject stream if necessary by setting "autoCloseBody" to false. In this scenario, it''s up to the caller to decide whether to manually manage the MinioObject stream closure.'
    - question: 'How can I set the option "bypassGovernanceMode" in an Apache Camel MinIO component for a consumer, and what is its default value when not explicitly specified?'
      answer: |
       'To set the option "bypassGovernanceMode" in an Apache Camel MinIO component for a consumer, you would include it in your configuration with a boolean value. For instance:              ```       minioComponent()           .bypassGovernanceMode(true) // set this to true if you want to bypass governance mode           .create();       ```              It is worth noting that when not explicitly specified, the default value of "bypassGovernanceMode" is `false`.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the "deleteAfterRead" option in the Apache Camel Minio component and under what conditions will the objects be deleted from Minio storage? Also, how can we filter duplicate retrievals when this option is set to false?'
      answer: |
       'The "deleteAfterRead" option in the Apache Camel Minio component has a default value of true, which means that after an object is retrieved from the Minio storage, it will be automatically deleted upon successful commitment of an exchange (transaction). However, if a rollback occurs, the object will not be deleted. When this option is set to false, the same objects may be retrieved over and over again in subsequent polls. To prevent duplicate retrievals, you should consider using the Idempotent Consumer Endpoint Interceptor (EIP) in your route configuration. The MinioConstants#BUCKET_NAME, MinioConstants#OBJECT_NAME headers can be used for filtering, or just the MinioConstants#OBJECT_NAME header specifically.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delimiter" option in the Apache Camel Minio component, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s Minio component, the "delimiter" option serves a particular function: it defines the separator used in the ListObjectsRequest to filter and process only specific objects of interest. However, it is important to note that this option is not mandatory as it has a default value of null, meaning no delimiter will be used if not explicitly set. This option falls under the "consumer" group within the Minio component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value (if any), data type, requirement (optional or required), and which group the "destinationBucketName" option belongs to in the Apache Camel Minio component?'
      answer: |
       'The "destinationBucketName" option in the Apache Camel Minio component is a string type that specifies the name of the bucket where the data will be stored, if provided. By default, it does not have a value (defaultValue: null). This option is not required to use the component as it belongs to the consumer group, meaning it''s primarily for defining where data comes from when working with Minio in Camel.'
    - question: 'How can you specify a destination object name when using the MinIO component in Apache Camel''s consumer configuration, if the object name is optional?'
      answer: |
       'When working with the MinIO component in Apache Camel''s consumer configuration, you can specify a destination object name (Bucket + Object Key) for the data that will be uploaded to MinIO. However, if the object name is optional, you can leave it as null. The "destinationObjectName" option allows you to do this, and its type is a string. Keep in mind that while specifying the object name is not mandatory (since its ''required'' value is false), it might be beneficial for easier management and organization of your MinIO data if a specific object name is provided.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `includeBody` option to false in the Apache Camel `minio` component affect the exchange body and MinioObject stream compared to when it is set to true? Furthermore, what happens to the exchange body when both `includeBody` and `autocloseBody` are set to false?'
      answer: |
       'When you set the `includeBody` option to false in the Apache Camel `minio` component, the exchange body will not contain the contents of the file but rather be null. Instead, the headers will be set with the Minio object metadata. The MinioObject stream, however, is not affected by this setting. This means that if you wish to manipulate the data within the stream, you would need to manage its closing manually as autoclosing will only happen when `autocloseBody` is set to true. If both `includeBody` and `autocloseBody` are set to false, the MinioObject stream remains open, and it is up to the caller to manage the closure of the stream.'
    - question: 'How does the "includeFolders" option in the Apache Camel Minio component affect the behavior when listing objects, and does it have a default value and any specific requirements for usage?'
      answer: |
       'The "includeFolders" option in the Apache Camel Minio component is used within ListObjectsRequest to determine whether directories or folders should be included when listing objects. By setting it to true, you include folders as part of the returned list. However, if not specified or set to false (the default value), only files will appear in the results. This option has no specific requirements for usage, but it belongs to the consumer group in terms of configuration options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''includeUserMetadata'' option in the Apache Camel MinIO component, and is it required or optional when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The ''includeUserMetadata'' option in the Apache Camel MinIO component is utilized to retrieve objects with user metadata during a ListObjectsRequest. Its default value is set to false, meaning that if not specified explicitly, the request will exclude user metadata. This flag is optional, you can include it in your request if you need to fetch objects along with their user-defined metadata; otherwise, its absence will not prevent the execution of the request within the ''consumer'' group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "includeVersions" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component, and is it a mandatory configuration? (Hint: The option allows listing objects with versioning.)'
      answer: |
       'The "includeVersions" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component is a boolean flag used within the ListObjectsRequest to retrieve objects that have versioning enabled. Its default value is false, meaning that objects without versioning are typically listed by default. However, setting it to true will return objects with versioning as well, allowing for more comprehensive object listings in your application or consumption workflows. It is not a mandatory configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and requirement (optional or required) for the Apache Camel component minio''s length option in consumer groups?'
      answer: |
       'The "length" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component within consumer groups is an optional integer parameter with a default value of null. Its purpose is to specify the number of bytes of object data from an offset while processing an object in MinIO.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''matchETag'' option in the Apache Camel MinIO component when it is not required, and to which group does it belong?'
      answer: |
       'The ''matchETif'' option within the Apache Camel MinIO component is designed to set the match ETag parameter for get object(s) requests. When not required, this option has no default value. It belongs to the consumer group.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum number of connections that can be set concurrently using the "maxConnections" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component, and what is its default value when this parameter is not explicitly provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "maxConnections" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component allows you to set the maximum number of concurrent connections to a MinIO server. The default value for this parameter is 60 when no explicit value is provided. However, whether setting it or not depends on the "consumer" group configuration in your client configuration for Minio.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and potential usage scenarios for the Apache Camel Minio component''s `maxMessagesPerPoll` option, which specifies a limit on the number of messages to poll at each iteration? Additionally, how can you configure this option to set it as unlimited?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel Minio component''s `maxMessagesPerPoll` option is 10. This option sets a limit on the number of messages that will be polled at each iteration. For instance, in scenarios where you have many small-sized messages to process concurrently and don''t wish to overload your application, setting a limit can help maintain system efficiency. If you want to configure this option to set it as unlimited, you can use 0 or a negative number as the value. This means that Camel will not enforce any limit on the number of messages polled during each iteration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "modifiedSince" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component, and is its usage optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'The "modifiedSince" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component serves to set the modified since parameter for retrieving an object(s) in a MinIO storage server. This parameter helps in efficient data fetching by specifying when an object was last modified, allowing only updated objects to be retrieved. Its default value is null, meaning that no specific last-modified date is set if not explicitly provided. The usage of this option is optional, as indicated by the "required" field being false.'
    - question: 'How does setting the "moveAfterRead" option to true in an Apache Camel MinIO route affect the behavior of retrieving and moving objects between buckets, and under what conditions would this copy bucket operation take place?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "moveAfterRead" option to true in an Apache Camel MinIO route allows for automatically moving objects from one bucket to another after they have been retrieved. This operation only occurs when the Exchange is committed. If the transaction encounters a rollback, the object will not be moved. The destination bucket must be specified using the ''destinationBucket'' option for this function to take place.'
    - question: 'How do you configure the Apache Camel MinIO component to skip an object download when its ETag does not match the expected value, if this feature is opt-in?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel MinIO component to skip a file download if its ETag does not match the expected value (an opt-in feature), you can set the "notMatchETag" option to true by passing "notMatchETag=true" as a parameter in your exchange options when making a get object request. For example:              ```java       from("minio://myBucket")           .toD(exchange -> {               String expectedETag = ... // Your logic to obtain the expected ETag value               exchange.getIn().setHeader("CamelMinioNotMatchETag", true);               exchange.getIn().setBody("GET myObject");           });       ```              In this example, the `notMatchETag` option is set to "true" using the Camel MinIO Exchange''s setHeader() method. By doing so, if the ETag of the downloaded file does not match the expected value, the component will automatically skip the file download. Keep in mind that this feature is optional and can be configured by setting the ''notMatchETag'' parameter to true as shown above or by omitting it when not needed.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''objectName'' option in the Apache Camel MinIO component, and is it required for usage?'
      answer: |
       'The ''objectName'' option in the Apache Camel MinIO component is designed to retrieve an object from the specified bucket based on its unique name. It doesn''t have a default value since the object name should ideally be provided by the user when working with the component. Using this option is not compulsory as it can be set to null, but for effective usage of the MinIO component, you might want to specify an object name to retrieve the desired object.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it''s required for the "offset" option in the Apache Camel component named "minio" when used as a consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The "offset" option in the "minio" component, used as a consumer, serves to specify the starting position of object data in bytes. Its default value is null (meaning no offset). The data type of this option is an integer. Whether it''s required or not depends on your specific use case; it''s optional and can be included if needed within the configuration group labeled "consumer".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "prefix" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component and does it have a default value, or can its use be omitted if a specific condition is met?'
      answer: |
       'The "prefix" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component serves to prefix the object name during file operations. If a prefix is set, any object you interact with through this component will have that specified string at the beginning of its name. However, it''s important to note that by default, this option does not have a value, meaning that no prefix will be applied unless explicitly defined. In terms of usage, if you don''t need a specific prefix for your objects, it can be left out as long as no value is assigned to it. The group associated with this option is "consumer".'
    - question: 'How do you configure the Apache Camel Minio component to list the contents of a directory, including its subdirectories (recurse through the directory structure), and what is the default value for this setting?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel Minio component to list the contents of a directory, including its subdirectories (recursive), you should set the "recursive" option to true. Here''s how to do that in your code:              ```java       MinioComponent minioComponent = new MinioComponent();       minioComponent.setRecursive(true);       ... // Other configuration options for the component       ```              The default value for the "recursive" option is false, meaning it will not list subdirectories by default. If you want to list only the immediate contents of a directory and not its subdirectories, simply use the default value or set it explicitly to `false`.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component''s consumer settings, and can this configuration be considered as an optional setting?'
      answer: |
       'The "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option within the Apache Camel MinIO component''s consumer settings serves to control whether an empty message (no body) is sent if the polling consumer does not poll any files. Its default value is false, meaning that no empty messages will be sent when the consumer is idle by default. This configuration can indeed be considered as an optional setting since it is marked as "required:false" in your provided information.'
    - question: 'Here is a potential question that could be asked about the "startAfter" option of the Apache Camel MinIO component:              "What is the purpose of the ''startAfter'' option in the Apache Camel MinIO component and when should it be used?"              Answering the question with the information provided would result in the following answer:              "The ''startAfter'' option in the Apache Camel MinIO component allows you to list objects in a bucket after a specific object name. This option is useful when you want to consume objects from a MinIO bucket starting from a certain point, such as resuming a failed job or skipping over older data. However, it is important to note that this option has a default value of null, meaning it can be used but is not required."'
      answer: |
       'The ''startAfter'' option in the Apache Camel MinIO component serves to list objects within a bucket after a designated object name. This feature is particularly valuable when you wish to consume objects from a MinIO bucket starting from a specific point, such as resuming a failed task or moving past older data without needing it. It''s essential to bear in mind that the ''startAfter'' option has a default value of null, implying that its use is optional, even though it can be employed when desired.'
    - question: 'How do you configure or use the optional `unModifiedSince` parameter in the Apache Camel MinIO component when making GET requests, and is it required to set a default value?'
      answer: |
       'To use the optional `unModifiedSince` parameter with the Apache Camel MinIO component during GET requests, you can configure it within your routes or processes. This parameter sets an unmodified since timestamp for object retrieval. Its default value is null, meaning no specific timestamp is specified (i.e., the server will return all objects).              It''s important to note that using `unModifiedSince` is not required; the component allows flexibility in terms of when you want to retrieve data based on its last modification date. To set a non-default value for this parameter, you can provide an Object containing the desired timestamp during configuration.              For instance, in Camel code:              ```java       From(minio://<bucketName>?)           .unModifiedSince(new DateObject("2021-05-01T00:00:00Z"));       ```'
    - question: 'In the context of using the Apache Camel MinIO component, can you explain the purpose and implications of setting the `useVersion1` option to `true`, especially when comparing it to its default value (`false`) and whether it is mandatory or optional to configure this option in the consumer group?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the Apache Camel MinIO component, setting the `useVersion1` option to `true` means that you''ll utilize version 1 of the REST API. This might be necessary if your application is designed to work specifically with version 1, or if compatibility issues arise when trying to use the more recent versions. Comparing it to its default value (`false`), using `useVersion1: true` forces Camel to employ an earlier version of the REST API. It''s worth noting that configuring this option as `true` is optional rather than mandatory within the consumer group. This flexibility allows developers to choose whether to prioritize compatibility with older MinIO versions or opt for the more modern API functions (when `useVersion1: false`).'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "versionId" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component, and is it required or optional? Furthermore, what is its default value and what data type should be provided when setting this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "versionId" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component is an optional feature (since it''s marked as "required: false") that allows you to set a specific version_ID of an object when deleting that object in Minio storage. By default, this value is null, meaning no version will be affected. When using this option, provide a string data type to specify the version_ID of the MinIO object you wish to delete. This feature can be particularly useful in situations where version control is necessary for your MinIO objects within the consumer group.'
    - question: 'Given the information provided about the "bridgeErrorHandler" option for the Apache Camel component ''minio'', can you explain when and why we would want to enable this option? And, can you also clarify what happens if we decide not to use this feature?              Also, how does it differ from the default exception handling mechanism of the camel consumer in terms of logging and ignoring exceptions?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s ''minio'' component, enabling the "bridgeErrorHandler" option allows for seamless integration with Camel''s routing Error Handler for exception handling. This becomes beneficial when you wish to manage any exceptions that may occur during message consumption by the Camel consumer.              If an exception occurs while the consumer is trying to fetch incoming messages, it will be treated as a regular message and passed on to the routing Error Handler instead of being ignored or logged at a higher severity level. This can facilitate more structured error handling, allowing you to process and recover from exceptions in a way that''s appropriate for your specific use case.              In situations where the 3rd party component does not permit Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown, or if it handles exceptions internally without exposing this capability, you will not be able to leverage the "bridgeErrorHandler" option. In such cases, the consumer''s default exception handling mechanism (org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler) will handle exceptions at WARN or ERROR log levels and ignore them by default.              Enabling bridgeErrorHandler differs from the default exception handling mechanism in that exceptions are passed on as regular messages for processing rather than being ignored or logged at a higher severity level. This can be advantageous if you require more flexible and customizable exception handling beyond Camel''s default logging and ignoring behavior.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom ExceptionHandler when using the Apache Camel MinIO component in a consumer scenario, and what is the default behavior for exception handling if no custom handler is provided?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom ExceptionHandler when using the Apache Camel MinIO component within a consumer scenario, you need to disable the bridgeErrorHandler option. This allows your application to use a custom ExceptionHandler. By default, when there''s no custom handler provided, the consumer will manage exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.'

      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option within the Apache Camel Minio component operates as a setting for defining the exchange pattern when a consumer creates an exchange. Its default value is null and is optional to use. Under the consumer (advanced) group, it sets the methodology that determines how messages are exchanged between components. Predefined values include InOut, InOnly, OutOnly, and Request-Reply.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "pollStrategy" option for the Apache Camel MinIO component, how can it be customized, does it have a default value, and under what configuration group (Camel component) can this option be found (advanced or regular)?'
      answer: |
       'The "pollStrategy" option for the Apache Camel MinIO component is designed to offer a customizable error-handling mechanism during the poll operation before an Exchange is created and routed. It utilizes an `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy` interface, allowing you to supply your personalized implementation to manage errors that may occur during the poll process. The default value for "pollStrategy" is null. This option falls under the "consumer (advanced)" configuration group of the Camel component, meaning it is not included in regular configurations but requires advanced usage.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel Minio producer component to delete the uploaded Minio files automatically once they have been written, and what is the default setting for this option?'
      answer: |
       'To automatically delete Minio files after they have been uploaded using the Apache Camel Minio producer component, you can set the "deleteAfterWrite" option to true. By default, this option is false, meaning that files are not deleted once uploaded. Here''s an example of how to configure it:              ```java       from("minio:your_minio_endpoint?deleteAfterWrite=true")           // rest of the Camel route logic       ```'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''keyName'' option in the Apache Camel MinIO component when it is used as a producer, and is this option mandatory or optional?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the Apache Camel MinIO component as a producer, the ''keyName'' option sets the name for an element in the bucket through an endpoint parameter. The default value for this option is null, meaning it is not automatically set if you don''t specify it yourself. This option is optional, so it can be excluded from your usage if needed. The group associated with this option is ''producer''.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and possible values (if any) of the "operation" option within the Apache Camel MinIO component for producer operations, when no upload-specific operation is desired? Is it optional and if not, what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "operation" option within the Apache Camel MinIO component for producer operations serves a purpose in cases where a user doesn''t intend to perform just an upload operation. This option does not have a default value (as specified by `defaultValue: null`), meaning you must provide an alternative operation when using this option. It is an optional parameter (`required: false`) under the "producer" group. When this option is used, it''s important to understand that the valid operations may vary depending on the specific implementation details of the MinIO component you are working with, as they are not specified in the given information.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "pojoRequest" option in the Apache Camel Minio component when used as a producer, and is its usage optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "pojoRequest" option in the Apache Camel Minio component, when used as a producer, determines if you want to use a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) as the request body. Its default value is false, meaning that the component does not use a POJO request body by default. Its usage is optional, allowing flexibility in your data exchange with MinIO.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, and whether it''s required for the "storageClass" option in the Apache Camel Minio producer component?'
      answer: |
       'The "storageClass" option in the Apache Camel Minio producer component is designed to specify the storage class for your data in MinIO. It does not have a default value. Whether it''s required or not depends on the specific use case; by default, it is not required. This means that if you do not explicitly set a storage class, one will not be automatically assigned.'
    - question: 'In the context of using Apache Camel with the Minio component, can you explain what the "lazyStartProducer" option does in terms of its effect on the producer startup behavior and why it might be beneficial to use this feature? Additionally, could you also clarify its default value, possible types, and the group to which this option belongs?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel with the Minio component, the "lazyStartProducer" option determines whether the producer should be started lazily (on the first message). If set to true, it allows the CamelContext and routes to start up in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during startup, preventing the route from starting up. Instead of causing the route failure at startup, this option defer''s the production failure to be handled via Camel''s routing error handlers during message processing.              However, be aware that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time, which can prolong the overall processing time of the operation.              By default, this option is set to false (not lazy), but it can be customized as a boolean value. It belongs to the "producer (advanced)" group of options in Minio integration with Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'How do you configure the custom HTTP client for authenticated access in an Apache Camel MinIO component? Is there a specific way to set it using the "customHttpClient" option, and does it accept an object type and is its usage considered as an advanced feature since it''s marked under the "groups":"advanced" category?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the custom HTTP client for authenticated access in the Apache Camel MinIO component, you can make use of the "customHttpClient" option, which allows you to set an object type as its value. This feature is considered an advanced setting, as indicated by it being grouped under "groups":"advanced". The custom HTTP client object should contain appropriate configurations for authentication when making requests to your MinIO server. To set this up, specify the object in the "customHttpClient" option of the MinIO component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel Minio option named "backoffErrorThreshold" when used in conjunction with a scheduler, and can it be configured as an integer if not set by default?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffErrorThreshold" option for the Apache Camel Minio component in a scheduler context is designed to specify the number of consecutive errors (retries due to some error) that should occur before the "backoffMultiplier" multiplier takes effect. By default, this value is not set, meaning it could be configured at your discretion. As stated in its definition, this parameter can be configured as an integer if not provided by default.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Minio component within the context of the scheduler group? If the default value is not specified, can you explain what happens if this option is not set in a Camel route configuration using the Minio component?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Minio component, under the scheduler group, determines the number of consecutive idle polls that should occur before the backoffMultiplier gets activated. This value is an integer, and if it''s not specified (defaultValue: null), it means there isn''t a fixed number of idle polls before the backoff strategy kicks in. In case this option is not set in a Camel route configuration using the Minio component, the behavior will depend on how the scheduler and backoff strategies are configured overall. The backoffIdleThreshold helps control the rate at which retries occur when dealing with idle polls during asynchronous operations within the Minio component.'
    - question: '"What is the purpose of the ''backoffMultiplier'' option in the Apache Camel MinIO component within the scheduler group, and how does it influence the frequency of attempts if there are subsequent idles or errors?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''backoffMultiplier'' option in the Apache Camel MinIO component, under the scheduler group, serves to allow the scheduled polling consumer to pause or backoff if a specific number of idles/errors occur consecutively. The multiplier denotes the number of scheduled attempts that will be skipped before the next attempt is made again. When you set ''backoffMultiplier'', it''s important to also configure ''backoffIdleThreshold'' and/''or backoffErrorThreshold''. In essence, this option controls the frequency of retry attempts if there are subsequent idles or errors in the processing sequence.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delay" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component when using the scheduler group, if it''s not required? And what data type should it be?'
      answer: |
       'The "delay" option within the Apache Camel MinIO component, when associated with the scheduler group, is an optional configuration setting that specifies the time in milliseconds before the next poll occurs. Its default value is 500 milliseconds, meaning if no other polling is scheduled, a new poll will take place after half a second has elapsed. This option determines the rate at which MinIO is checked or polled for new data. The "delay" option type is integer.'
    - question: 'Here''s a question that can be answered based on the provided information:              "What is the effect of setting the ''greedy'' option to true in an Apache Camel Minio component when using a ScheduledPollConsumer, and is this option required for its functionality?"'
      answer: |
       'Setting the ''greedy'' option to true in the Apache Camel Minio component, when used with a ScheduledPollConsumer, means that if the previous run polled one or more messages, the consumer will run immediately again. However, this option is not required for the functionality of the component; it is optional within the scheduler groups.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component under the scheduler group, and is it required for the operation of this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component falls under the scheduler group. Its purpose is to specify the number of milliseconds before the first poll starts, providing a delay if needed at the beginning. The default value for this option is 1000 milliseconds (or 1 second). It''s important to note that using an "initialDelay" is optional and not strictly required for the operation of the MinIO component in Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum limit on the number of times a MinIO component in Apache Camel''s scheduler will execute if the "repeatCount" option is set to a specific integer value, and what happens if it is not explicitly set or given a zero or negative value?'
      answer: |
       'The maximum limit on the number of times a MinIO component within Apache Camel''s scheduler will execute is determined by the "repeatCount" option. If you set this option to an integer value, it specifies the maximum number of times the scheduler will fire. For instance, if you set it to 1, the component will only execute once; if you set it to 5, it will execute five times. However, if you leave it unspecified, give it a zero or negative value, it means the component will execute indefinitely or forever.'
    - question: 'What is the default logging level for the start/complete log lines generated by the Camel Minio component when it polls, and can this level be adjusted using the "runLoggingLevel" option? If yes, what possible values can this option take according to the provided information?'
      answer: |
       'The default logging level for the start/complete log lines generated by the Camel Minio component when it polls is TRACE, as specified in the configuration of the component. It''s worth noting that you can adjust this level using the "runLoggingLevel" option if needed. The possible values for this option, according to the provided information, include objects with no specific value restriction within the scheduler group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "scheduledExecutorService" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component and does it have a default value, and can its usage be associated with scheduling tasks or processing in the context of this configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "scheduledExecutorService" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default, each consumer runs on its own single-threaded thread pool. However, by using this configuration, you can utilize a multi-threaded approach or share threads among consumers, which can enhance throughput and parallel processing if required. This option is associated with scheduling tasks or processing in the context of Camel routing since it modifies the execution strategy of the MinIO component within your routing system. Notably, this option does not have a default value; its usage is optional and part of the "scheduler" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "scheduler" option within the Apache Camel Minio component, and what values can be used to utilize a built-in cron scheduler when using either the camel-spring or camel-quartz components? Furthermore, can you provide the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "scheduler" option within the Apache Camel Minio component is used to configure a scheduler, allowing you to run actions at specific intervals. You can utilize a built-in cron scheduler when using either the camel-spring or camel-quartz components by providing the values ''spring'' or ''quartz'', respectively, for this option. There is no default value for this option as it is an optional setting. This means that if you don''t specify a value, the component will not be configured with a scheduler.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "schedulerProperties" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component, and under what circumstances (i.e., which groups) can it be configured? Additionally, could you please explain what role this option plays when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz or Spring-based schedulers within the MinIO component?'
      answer: |
       'The "schedulerProperties" option in the Apache Camel Minio component is designed to allow configuration of additional properties when utilizing a custom scheduler, either one of the Quartz or Spring-based schedulers, for example. It''s important to note that this option does not have a default value and its configuration is optional. This property group, identified as "scheduler", is where you can make adjustments to the scheduling properties within the MinIO component. When using this option with a custom or pre-defined scheduler, it serves to customize the behavior of the scheduler according to specific requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior, and if it''s configurable, can the Apache Camel MinIO component''s startScheduler option be explicitly set to false? (Default value: true; type: boolean; required: false)'
      answer: |
       'Yes, by default the "startScheduler" option for the Apache Camel MinIO component is set to true, which means the scheduler is auto started. However, it can be configured explicitly if needed. If you want to disable the auto-start behavior, you can set the "startScheduler" option to false when initializing the component in your Camel route.'
    - question: 'What is the default data type (or time unit) of the "initialDelay" and "delay" options in the Apache Camel Minio component when no specific time unit is provided for these options, as documented?'
      answer: |
       'The default time unit for both "initialDelay" and "delay" options in the Apache Camel Minio component, when no specific time unit is provided, is Milliseconds (MILLISECONDS).'
    - question: 'How can you configure the Apache Camel Minio component''s useFixedDelay option to not use a fixed delay and instead use a fixed rate for scheduling tasks, when its default value is true?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel Minio component''s useFixedDelay option to not use a fixed delay and instead use a fixed rate for scheduling tasks, you can set the "useFixedDelay" option to false when using this component. Even though its default value is true, you can override it in your route builder or configuration file according to your specific use case. For instance:              ```java       from("minio:your-endpoint?useFixedDelay=false")       // Your routing logic here       ```              Or if using Blueprint XML configuration, set the property like so:              ```xml       <bean id="myMinioEndpoint" class="org.apache.camel.component.minio.MinioComponent">           <property name="useFixedDelay" value="false"/>       </bean>       ```'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "accessKey" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component, and can it be left blank or null? Also, what type of data does this option accept, and under which security group of options does it fall?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessKey" option in the Apache Camel MinIO component is designed to provide an Access Key for connecting to a Minio server. This could be equivalent to an Amazon AWS Secret Access Key if you''re using Minio as a drop-in replacement for S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service). If this option is not set, Camel will connect to the service for anonymous access. The "accessKey" option accepts string data and falls under the "security" group of options in terms of sensitive configuration details. However, it can be left blank or null if you wish to use anonymous access, but this may limit certain functionalities depending on your usage scenario.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "secretKey" option in the Apache Camel component called "minio", and does it require a default value or need to be configured when using this component? Additionally, could you explain the significance of setting a secret key for security purposes with Minio?'
      answer: |
       'The "secretKey" option within the Apache Camel component named "minio" serves as either an Amazon AWS Access Key Id or a Minio Secret Key. When not explicitly set, Camel connects to the service anonymously. The significance of setting a secret key for security purposes with Minio is that it provides authentication and access control, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot interact with your Minio server or storage buckets. This secret key helps protect data confidentiality by preventing unauthorized users from reading your files or accessing sensitive information stored on the Minio service.'
    - question: 'What is the default value, required status, and possible data type for the Apache Camel component MinIO''s serverSideEncryption option in terms of its security group?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "serverSideEncryption" option within the Apache Camel component MinIO is null, meaning encryption is not set by default. It is not required to use this option, but it falls under the "security" group of settings, indicating it pertains to data protection and confidentiality. The data type of this setting is an object.'
