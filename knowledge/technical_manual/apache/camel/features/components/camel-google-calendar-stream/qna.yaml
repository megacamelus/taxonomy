    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel''s "google-calendar-stream" component, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "applicationName" option in Apache Camel''s "google-calendar-stream" component is an optional string parameter that provides the name of the Google Calendar application. The default value for this option is null, meaning no specific application name is set if not provided. Its purpose is to help identify the Google Calendar application when using the component in a Camel route.'
    - question: 'Can you explain how the `bridgeErrorHandler` option works in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component, and under what conditions it is possible for this option to be utilized effectively? Also, could you elaborate on the default behavior when `bridgeErrorHandler` is not enabled, and why some components may handle exceptions internally only and therefore cannot use this feature?'
      answer: |
       'The `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component enables bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions (if supported by the third-party component) that occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.              However, it''s important to note that this feature is only possible if the third-party component allows Camel to be alerted when an exception was thrown. Some components may handle exceptions internally only, and in such cases, the `bridgeErrorHandler` is not applicable. In other situations, we may improve the Camel component to integrate with the third-party component, making this feature possible for future releases.              By default, when `bridgeErrorHandler` is not enabled, the consumer will use the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler`. Exceptions will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and then ignored. This default behavior ensures that your application keeps running even in the event of exceptions, but it may result in lost messages or unhandled errors if no specific exception handler is defined elsewhere in your Camel route.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "calendarId" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option? If not provided, what is the default value used by the component?'
      answer: |
       'The "calendarId" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component specifies the unique identifier for a specific Google Calendar that the component will interact with. While providing a value for this option is not mandatory, if left unspecified, the default value used by the component will be "primary", which refers to the user''s primary calendar.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" serves as the Client ID of your calendar application. It''s a string value used for identifying applications to Google Calendar API. By default, it has no preset value ("defaultValue": null). Using this option is not mandatory as it belongs to the "consumer" group of options and can be provided if needed when configuring the component for use.'
    - question: 'What is the configuration structure for the Apache Camel''s google-calendar-stream component, and is it required when using this component in a consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The configuration structure for Apache Camel''s `google-calendar-stream` component is an object type, denoted as "The configuration". It is optional, meaning you don''t necessarily need to provide it when using this component in a consumer. The group of options related to this component is referred to as "consumer".'
    - question: 'In relation to the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", could you explain what is the purpose and functionality of the option named "considerLastUpdate" when it is set to true or false? Also, does it have a default value and is its usage optional or mandatory?'
      answer: |
       'When using the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", the option named "considerLastUpdate" determines whether the lastUpdate timestamp of the last event polled should be taken into account as the start date for the next poll. If set to true, the component will use the lastUpdate timestamp from the most recent event for the following polls, starting from that point. Conversely, if set to false (its default value), the component will start a new poll from the initial time configured. The usage of this option is optional, and it belongs to the "consumer" group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "consumeFromNow" option within the Apache Camel''s Google Calendar Stream component, and is it set to its default value by default?'
      answer: |
       'The "consumeFromNow" option in Apache Camel''s Google Calendar Stream component determines whether to start consuming events from the current time (now) onwards in the selected calendar. By default, this option is set to true, meaning it will consume events from now on without requiring explicit specification. This feature is useful for continuous monitoring and processing of new events as they occur in the Google Calendar.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel''s Google Calendar Stream component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option when using this component? Additionally, what type of data does this option expect?'
      answer: |
       'The "delegate" option in Apache Camel''s Google Calendar Stream component serves to delegate access for a wide-domain service account. This means that you can use it to authorize your application to act as another user when interacting with Google Calendars. However, providing a value for this option is not mandatory; it''s optional and you can choose whether or not to specify it depending on your use case. When using the "delegate" option, you should provide a string value that represents the email address of the service account you wish to delegate access from.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum value for the "maxResults" option in Apache Camel''s Google Calendar Stream component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option? (Answer: The maximum value for the "maxResults" option in the Google Calendar Stream component of Apache Camel is not specified. It is optional and can be provided with any integer value.)'
      answer: |
       'In response to your question, the maximum value for the "maxResults" option in the Google Calendar Stream component of Apache Camel is not explicitly defined. It''s an optional parameter that can be supplied with any integer value.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "query" option within the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream"?'
      answer: |
       'The "query" option within the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" is designed for executing queries on Google Calendar. Its purpose is to filter or specify the data you want to retrieve from your calendar, such as a specific event or events matching certain criteria. By default, it accepts no query, allowing you to retrieve all data if nothing is specified.'
    - question: 'What are the possible scopes (permissions levels) that can be specified when using the ''google-calendar-stream'' component in Apache Camel, and where can I find more information about these scopes and their respective permissions?'
      answer: |
       'When using the ''google-calendar-stream'' component in Apache Camel, you can specify various levels of permissions or scopes for a calendar application to access a user account. These scopes determine what actions the application can perform on your behalf. The possible scopes include:              1. `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` - Basic Calendar API access (read-only)       2. `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events` - Access to read, create, update, and delete the user''s calendar events       3. `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly` - Read-only access to the user''s calendar data (does not grant the ability to modify events)       4. `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendars.readonly` - Read-only access to the user''s available calendars (does not grant the ability to create, update, or delete calendars)              For a comprehensive understanding of these scopes and their respective permissions, I recommend visiting the Google Calendar API documentation page at https://developers.google.com/calendar/auth for more information and details on implementing them in Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'How is the ''syncFlow'' option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component different from other options, and when is it recommended to enable this option? (Hint: check out the documentation at https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/sync)'
      answer: |
       'The ''syncFlow'' option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component is unique as it enables synchronization of events between your application and Google Calendar. This is different from other options primarily because it doesn''t work with the ''query'' and ''considerLastUpdate'' parameters. You should consider enabling this option when you want to keep your application''s calendar in sync with the one on Google Calendar, as documented at <https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/sync>. While it is not a required setting, understanding its functionality and benefits can help ensure seamless data synchronization between your application and Google Calendar.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" affect its behavior, and what are some possible use cases for this feature?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" allows for automatic autowiring of dependencies within the component. This means that if a component or service is marked as autowired, it can be automatically looked up from the Camel registry and configured on the component. This feature can streamline the configuration process, especially when dealing with complex dependencies like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. However, please note that while this option is available for "google-calendar-stream", it may not directly apply to scheduling Google Calendar events as it primarily targets services and dependencies. To confirm how this might impact the behavior of "google-calendar-stream" specifically, you should refer to its official documentation or consult with experts in Camel integration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientFactory" option in the advanced group when using the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientFactory" option in the advanced group of the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component is an object type that allows you to provide a custom factory for creating Google Calendar API clients. This option has no default value, meaning it''s up to the user to supply a suitable implementation if needed. Its purpose is to enable greater flexibility and control over the client creation process when using this component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", and can it be set to false if needed, considering its group belongs to "health"?'
      answer: |
       'The "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" is used for enabling or disabling all consumer-based health checks from this component. Its default value is true. Since it belongs to the "health" group, you can set it to false if needed, depending on your system''s health monitoring requirements.'
    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the `healthCheckProducerEnabled` option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component affect health-checks for producer components, and what is the default value of this option?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the `healthCheckProducerEnabled` option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component allows you to control whether all producer-based health checks are active or not from this specific component. By default, Camel has disabled these producer-based health checks. However, if you wish to enable them globally for all components, set `camel.health.producersEnabled=true`. If the `healthCheckProducerEnabled` option is left as its default value (true), it means that producer health checks are enabled in the Google Calendar Stream component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and recommended usage of the "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", and why is it suggested to use "refreshToken" for long-term usage?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" is an OAuth 2 access token, providing authorization to access your Google Calendar data via this stream component. However, it''s important to note that this token typically expires after an hour. For long-term usage, it''s recommended to use the "refreshToken" option instead. Refresh tokens are designed to be used for refreshing access tokens automatically when they expire, making them more suitable for prolonged usage scenarios. This helps ensure continuous access to your Google Calendar data within Camel integrations without needing constant user intervention to renew the access token.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", and is it required for configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" serves as the client secret of your Google Calendar application. This secret, along with the client ID, is used to authenticate your application when accessing Google Calendar''s data. However, it does not have a default value and its usage is optional in the configuration process. The "clientSecret" falls under the ''security'' group of options, emphasizing its role in ensuring the secure communication between your application and the Google Calendar service.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the "emailAddress" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "emailAddress" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" is an optional string parameter, used to specify the email address of the Google Service Account. By default, this value is not set ("defaultValue": null). This option is categorized under the security group as it involves handling sensitive information related to your Google account.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the option named "p12FileName" in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", and is it required for configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The option named "p12FileName" in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" serves the purpose of specifying the name of the p12 file that contains the private key used with the Google Service Account. Its default value is null, meaning no specific file is set by default. However, using this option is not mandatory for configuration as it''s marked as an optional setting under the "security" group.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Google Calendar Stream component in Apache Camel to use an OAuth 2 refresh token for obtaining a new access token when the current one expires, to ensure the application remains functional even with long-lived access?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Google Calendar Stream component in Apache Camel to utilize an OAuth 2 refresh token for obtaining a new access token when the current one expires, ensuring the application''s continued functionality during its long-lived state, you can set the "refreshToken" option. This option will allow the component to automatically obtain a fresh access token whenever necessary.              Here''s how you can do it:              1. In your Camel route or processor configuration, specify the Google Calendar Stream component with the appropriate properties.              2. Add the "refreshToken" option and set its value to the refresh token obtained during the initial OAuth 2 authorization process.              Your updated configuration should look like this:              ```       from("google-calendar-stream:restlet://mycal@example.com?consumerKey=my-consumer-key&oauthConsumerSecret=my-oauth-consumer-secret&refreshToken=my-refresh-token")           ...       ```              In this example, replace "my-refresh-token" with your obtained refresh token. The other properties are the consumer key, consumer secret and the calendar address (email) you''d like to access.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and format of the "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", and is it required for using this component? Additionally, what kind of data should be provided if it is not null?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceAccountKey" option within the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" serves to authenticate your application as a service account when interacting with Google Calendar. This key should be provided in JSON format, but can optionally be base64 encoded by prefixing it with "base64:". It is not a required field, meaning you may choose not to provide it; however, if you do decide to use it, you would provide the service account key as a string. The data type of this option is string, and it falls under the security group due to its role in authentication process.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "user" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "user" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" is intended for impersonating a specific user within the service account flow. It''s responsible for defining the email address of the user the application will act as when interacting with Google Calendar. Its default value is null, meaning it doesn''t have a predefined value and can be set according to your needs. However, using this option is not mandatory; its inclusion in the componentflow is optional under the security group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component is an optional string parameter that represents the name of the Google Calendar application. Although it doesn''t have a default value, providing an applicationName can be helpful for differentiating your app from others when interacting with the Google Calendar API. The requirement to provide this option is not mandatory, but doing so may enhance the clarity and organization of your interactions with the API.'

However, it is not compatible with both ''query'' and ''considerLastUpdate'' parameters simultaneously. The `syncFlow` option can be set to true or false, but its use is optional in the consumer group.'
    - question: 'How does the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel component google-calendar-stream function, and under what conditions is it possible for this option to be utilized? Additionally, what happens by default if the bridgeErrorHandler option is not used?'
      answer: |
       'The `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel component `google-calendar-stream` enables bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages from Google Calendar will be processed as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler.              However, it''s important to note that this functionality is only possible if the third-party component (in this case, Google Calendar) allows Camel to be notified if an exception was thrown. Some components may handle exceptions internally without providing such notification, making the `bridgeErrorHandler` option ineffective.              In situations where the component does support it, we may improve the Camel component to integrate with the third-party component and make this functionality available for future releases. By default, if the `bridgeErrorHandler` option is not used, the consumer will use the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler`. Exceptions will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and then ignored.'
    - question: 'What is the functionality of the "exceptionHandler" option within the Apache Camel''s "google-calendar-stream" component, and under what conditions is it not in use if the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled? Also, can you explain when a custom ExceptionHandler would be useful for this component?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s "google-calendar-stream" component, the "exceptionHandler" option allows users to implement a custom ExceptionHandler. However, if the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled, the "exceptionHandler" is not utilized. By default, exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level will be handled by the consumer, and ignored. A custom ExceptionHandler would be beneficial in scenarios where specific error handling logic beyond the default behavior is required for this component.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component, and can it be configured, and if so, under which group of options is it considered?'
      answer: |

Its purpose is to set the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. This option can be configured if needed, and it falls under the "consumer (advanced)" group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel `google-calendar-stream` component, and under what group is it considered (if any)?'
      answer: |
       'The `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel `google-calendar-stream` component is designed to provide a customizable error handling strategy for issues that may arise during the poll operation prior to an Exchange being created and routed within Camel. By default, it does not have a preset value, allowing you to implement your own specific error handling logic as needed. This option falls under the "consumer (advanced)" group, signifying its use may be more relevant for advanced users or situations requiring fine-tuning of Camel''s consumer behavior.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel "google-calendar-stream" component, and can it be configured under which group (if any) in the scheduler?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel "google-calendar-stream" component determines the number of subsequent error polls that should occur before the "backoffMultiplier" should activate, due to some error during the polling process. By default, it has no specified value. This setting can be configured under the "scheduler" group if required for managing the retry behavior in case of errors.'
    - question: '"What is the purpose and default value of the ''backoffIdleThreshold'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-calendar-stream'', and is it a mandatory configuration parameter?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''backoffIdleThreshold'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-calendar-stream'' serves as the number of successive idle polls that should occur before the ''backoffMultipler'' is activated. This means, if there are no events to process for a certain period, it delays subsequent requests to Google Calendar API based on a multiplier. The default value for this option is null, which implies that you may provide a custom integer value according to your use case. It is an optional configuration parameter, meaning you can choose whether or not to set its value in the component''s configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "backoffMultiplier" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", and when should it be configured along with "backoffIdleThreshold" and/or "backoffErrorThreshold"? Additionally, what is the default value for this option and which group does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffMultiplier" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" allows the scheduled polling consumer to skip a specified number of attempts if there have been consecutive idle or error events. This is useful when you want the consumer to temporarily pause its operations, for instance, after experiencing transient issues with Google Calendar API.              The backoffMultiplier value indicates the number of skipped polls before the next attempt is made again. You should configure this option along with "backoffIdleThreshold" and/or "backoffErrorThreshold," as they define the conditions under which idle or error events are considered to occur, respectively.              The default value for the "backoffMultiplier" option is null, meaning it does not have a predefined value when the component is initialized without explicit configuration. The group to which this option belongs is "scheduler."'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it is required for the "delay" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-calendar-stream", and which group of options does this delay option belong to within the scheduler?'
      answer: |
       'The "delay" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-calendar-stream" is an optional parameter that sets the milliseconds before the next poll, allowing you to control the frequency of interaction with Google Calendar. Its default value is 500 milliseconds, making it an integer data type. This option belongs to the "scheduler" group within the component''s configuration settings.'
    - question: 'What is the function of the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", and does it have a default value, as well as any requirements for its usage?'
      answer: |
       'The "greedy" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" allows the ScheduledPollConsumer to execute immediately again if the previous run polled one or more messages. In other words, it triggers an immediate re-polling in case new events were retrieved during the last poll. The default value for this option is false, meaning that re-polling does not occur after a successful poll by default. Its usage is optional and falls under the "scheduler" group of configuration options.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the initialDelay option in the Apache Camel google-calendar-stream component, and is it a mandatory configuration parameter? (Answer: The default value is 1000 milliseconds, it is an integer, and it is not a required configuration parameter.)'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel "google-calendar-stream" component is 1000 milliseconds (or one second). It is of data type integer, meaning only numerical values are accepted. And, it is not a required configuration parameter; you can choose to omit it if you wish.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum number of times a Google Calendar stream in Apache Camel will run if the "repeatCount" option is set to 5, and how does it behave if this option is not specified or set to 0?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of a Google Calendar stream within Apache Camel, if you set the "repeatCount" option to 5, the scheduler will execute the stream up to five times. This is because the "repeatCount" specifies a maximum limit for the number of fires, so it constrains the operation to a defined number of executions.              However, if this option is not specified or set to 0, the behavior changes. A value of zero or negative means that the stream will fire indefinitely (or "forever"). This allows the stream to run continuously without any limit on the number of times it can execute.'
    - question: 'What is the default logging level for the ''start/complete'' logs in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component, and how can the user modify this logging level?'
      answer: |
       'The default logging level for the ''start/complete'' logs in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component is TRACE. If a user wishes to modify this logging level, they can do so by changing the "runLoggingLevel" option. This option allows you to configure the logging level for the component, with available options including: OFF, FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, and TRACE. To set a custom logging level, simply specify the desired value under the "runLoggingLevel" option when configuring your Apache Camel application.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom or shared thread pool using the scheduledExecutorService option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component? And what is the default behavior if this option is not specified?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom or shared thread pool for the consumer of the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component, you can utilize the `scheduledExecutorService` option. This allows you to define your own thread pool instead of using a single-threaded pool per consumer by default. If this option is not specified, each consumer will operate with its own single-threaded thread pool.'
    - question: 'What is the correct way to set up a scheduler using the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component and how can I use a cron scheduler with it, given that I have the option to utilize either camel-spring or camel-quartz for built-in scheduling?'
      answer: |
       'To set up a scheduler using the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component, you can leverage either the camel-spring or camel-quartz components for built-in scheduling. If you wish to use a cron scheduler with it, simply specify the value "spring" or "quartz" in the "scheduler" option. This allows you to configure your desired cron schedule within these components. Keep in mind that using a scheduler is an optional feature as indicated by the "required": false in the configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "schedulerProperties" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component, and is it optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'The "schedulerProperties" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component serves to configure additional properties when utilizing a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz/Spring-based schedulers. It does not have a default value, meaning you can set it according to your specific requirements. This option is optional, not required.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the "startScheduler" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component, and can it be manually controlled when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "startScheduler" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component is to automatically start the scheduler (true). However, you can manually control its starting by setting this option to false if needed, as it is an optional property in the scheduler group.'

      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component named "google-calendar-stream" within the "scheduler" groups, the default data type for the "timeUnit" option is an object. This option defines the time unit for the "initialDelay" and "delay" options, and it can take values in milliseconds (MILLISECONDS) as its default value if not explicitly specified during configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", and when should it be set to false instead of its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" is true, meaning a fixed delay will be used. If you want to use a fixed rate instead, you should set this option to false. This setting should be considered when you want to execute Google Calendar events at a consistent interval without regard for their duration, rather than waiting the duration of the previous event before triggering the next one.'
    - question: 'Given the provided information, here''s a potential question that could be asked about the Apache Camel component google-calendar-stream and its accessToken option:              "Why is it advisable to use refreshToken instead of accessToken for long-term usage with the google-calendar-stream component in Apache Camel?"'
      answer: |
       'Using the OAuth 2 access token provided with the Google Calendar Stream component in Apache Camel typically expires after an hour. Since you may require longer-term usage, it is advisable to use the refreshToken instead of the accessToken. This is because refreshTokens are designed to provide a means of obtaining a new access token when the current one expires or becomes invalid. This ensures that your application can continue to interact with Google Calendar without interruption.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", and is it required?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" serves as the client secret of the calendar application. This secret, along with the client ID, is used for OAuth2 authentication when accessing the Google Calendar API. By default, it doesn''t have a value assigned, which means you should provide your own client secret during configuration. The requirement for providing a client secret is optional but recommended for security purposes, as it helps verify the identity of your application and maintain the confidentiality of your requests. This option falls under the "security" group in terms of its importance to overall system security.'

    - question: 'How can I configure the refreshToken option in the Apache Camel component google-calendar-stream to use an OAuth 2 refresh token for obtaining a new accessToken when the current one expires, and is this configuration step optional?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the refreshToken option in the Apache Camel component `google-calendar-stream` for using an OAuth 2 refresh token, you should set it as a string value. This token allows the Google Calendar component to obtain a new accessToken when the current one expires, which is important if your application has a long lifespan. However, it''s optional to use this configuration step since the component can still function without it, but refresh tokens improve the security and continuity of your application by ensuring uninterrupted access to Google Calendar services.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and format of the "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", and is it required for authentication? If provided, how should it be formatted, including any necessary prefixes or encodings?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" is used to authenticate an application as a service account when interacting with Google Calendar API. It should be provided in JSON format, but base64 encoded, prefixed with "base64:".
