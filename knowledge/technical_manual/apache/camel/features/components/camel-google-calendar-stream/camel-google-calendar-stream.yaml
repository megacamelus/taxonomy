    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''applicationName'' option within the Apache Camel''s ''google-calendar-stream'' component, and is it mandatory or optional to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The ''applicationName'' option within Apache Camel''s ''google-calendar-stream'' component is an optional parameter that provides the name of the Google Calendar application. A common example would be ''camel-google-calendar/1.0''. However, it does not have a default value and its inclusion when configuring the component is not mandatory.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" so that exceptions that occur during message pickup are handled by the routing Error Handler instead of being logged and ignored, utilizing the bridgeErrorHandler option?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" so that exceptions occurring during message pickup are handled by the routing Error Handler instead of being logged and ignored, you need to set the "bridgeErrorHandler" option to true. This can be achieved in your route builder configuration as follows:              ```java       from("google-calendar-stream")           .errorHandler(new BridgeErrorHandler()) // enable bridgeErrorHandler           // rest of your route configuration...       ```              Please note that for this option to work, the third-party component (in this case, Google Calendar) should support passing exceptions to Camel. If the third party component handles exceptions internally and doesn''t provide a means for Camel to be alerted, then bridgeErrorHandler might not be an option.              In cases where the current implementation of the component does not support bridgeErrorHandler, consider checking future releases that may improve the Camel component to hook into the third-party component and make this possible.'
    - question: 'What is the optional string parameter `calendarId` in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" used for, and what is its default value if it''s not provided?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", the optional string parameter `calendarId` is used to specify a unique identifier for the Google Calendar that you wish to interact with. If this parameter is not provided, the default value is `primary`, which refers to the main calendar of the authenticated user.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientId" option within the "google-calendar-stream" component in Apache Camel, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option within the "google-calendar-stream" component in Apache Camel serves the purpose of providing a Client ID for the calendar application. This value is not a default (defaultValue: null), meaning you''ll need to provide it yourself when configuring the component. Its usage is optional, as indicated by the "required: false". This group ("consumer") refers to the configuration settings related to consuming messages from a consumer endpoint in Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What are the available configuration options for the Google Calendar Stream component in Apache Camel when using it as a consumer, and does it have a default value for any of those options?'
      answer: |
       'The Google Calendar Stream component in Apache Camel, used as a consumer, has an available configuration option called "configuration". This configuration is used to specify settings related to the Google Calendar connection. However, it does not have a default value for this option; you''ll need to provide the configuration object explicitly when setting up the component.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `considerLastUpdate` option to true in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component affect the start date for the next event polling?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `considerLastUpdate` option to true in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component means that it will take into account the lastUpdate of the last event polled as the start date for the next event polling, thereby ensuring that the component only fetches events updated after this point. If left at its default value (false), the component starts polling from the initial sync time with Google Calendar, which may cause unnecessary fetching of repeated events if they were recently updated but not within the polling interval.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "consumeFromNow" option for the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream"? Is it required for configuration and does it belong to a specific group of options?'
      answer: |
       'The "consumeFromNow" option for the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" is a boolean type with a default value of true. Its purpose is to consume events in the selected Google Calendar from the current time onwards. This option is not mandatory for configuration, as it has a default value, and it belongs to the "consumer" group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", and is it a required parameter? (Answer: The delegate option for the google-calendar-stream component allows setting a wide-domain service account. It has no default value, and its usage is optional.)'
      answer: |
       'The "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" is meant for setting a wide-domain service account. This option does not have a default value and its usage is optional.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum number of results that can be returned at once when using the ''maxResults'' option in the Apache Camel component named ''google-calendar-stream'', if it is not specified (i.e., set to its default value)?'
      answer: |
       'When using the ''maxResults'' option with the Apache Camel component called ''google-calendar-stream'', if it is not explicitly specified, the maximum number of results returned at once will be 10 (the default value).'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "query" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-calendar-stream", if this option is not required?'
      answer: |
       'The "query" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-calendar-stream" is designed to facilitate custom queries on Google Calendar. However, it does not have a default value; it can be left null when using this component if no specific query is needed for your operations. It''s part of the consumer group, which means its role is to fetch data from external systems, in this case, from Google Calendar via queries.'
    - question: 'What are the possible scopes that can be specified for the Google Calendar Stream component in Apache Camel when using the "google-calendar-stream" option, and what is their default value if not explicitly set?'
      answer: |
       'In response to your query, the Google Calendar Stream component in Apache Camel allows specifying various scopes for accessing a user''s account when using the "google-calendar-stream" option. These scopes define the level of permissions you want a calendar application to have. If you don''t explicitly set the scopes, they will not have a default value. For more detailed information about available scopes and their usage, please refer to the Google Calendar API documentation at developers.google.com/calendar/auth.'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel option "syncFlow" in the "google-calendar-stream" component function, and is it compatible with both ''query'' and ''considerLastUpdate'' parameters when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "syncFlow" option in the "google-calendar-stream" Apache Camel component functions by automatically syncing events from Google Calendar without needing a constant poll for updates. However, it''s important to note that it is not compatible with both ''query'' and ''considerLastUpdate'' parameters when using this component. You can find more detailed information about synchronization flows in the Google Calendar API documentation linked here: https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/sync'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel google-calendar-stream component, and is it required for the basic functioning of this component? (It''s optional and can be used for automatic configuring Google Calendar options such as data sources or connection factories if available.)'
      answer: |
       'The ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel google-calendar-stream component is a boolean value that determines whether autowiring is enabled for automatically configuring Google Calendar options such as data sources or connection factories. Its default value is true, indicating that autowiring is enabled by default. This option is optional and can be useful for advanced users who want to automate the configuration of certain Google Calendar components. It''s important to note that this feature does not affect the basic functioning of the google-calendar-stream component itself.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "clientFactory" option within the Apache Camel "google-calendar-stream" component, and does it have a default value when not provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientFactory" option in the Apache Camel "google-calendar-stream" component serves the purpose of providing a factory for creating Google Calendar clients. However, it does not have a default value, meaning if you choose not to provide it when using this component, it will require manual initialization of the Google Calendar client outside of the component.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option in the Apache Camel''s Google Calendar Stream component, and can it be set to false to disable all consumer-based health checks from this specific component?'
      answer: |
       'The "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option in Apache Camel''s Google Calendar Stream component is used for enabling or disabling all consumer-based health checks within this component. Its default value is true, meaning that health checks are enabled by default. You can manually set it to false if you wish to disable these consumer-based health checks specifically for this component. This option falls under the "health" group of options in Camel configuration.'
    - question: 'How does one configure the "google-calendar-stream" Apache Camel component to disable all producer based health checks? If the default value for the option "healthCheckProducerEnabled" is true as provided, how would you set it to false in this specific component?'
      answer: |
       'To disable all producer-based health checks for the "google-calendar-stream" Apache Camel component, you should set the option "healthCheckProducerEnabled" to false. You can do this by modifying your configuration as follows:              ```       google-calendar-stream{         // Other properties...         healthCheckProducerEnabled=false       }       ```              Please remember that if you want producer checks to be enabled globally for all components in Apache Camel, you must set `camel.health.producersEnabled=true`. With this setting, the default value for the "google-calendar-stream" component will stay as false and disable producer-based health checks specifically for this component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel''s "google-calendar-stream" component, and why is it recommended to use a refreshToken instead for prolonged usage? Is it required to provide an initial value for the accessToken, and where does the component obtain a default value if none is provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessToken" option in Apache Camel''s "google-calendar-stream" component is used to authenticate with Google Calendar API. However, it''s important to note that this token typically expires after an hour, hence for prolonged usage, it''s recommended to use a refreshToken instead, which can provide a fresh access token when needed. The "accessToken" option doesn''t require an initial value by default; the component does not provide a default value itself, so if none is provided, the API authentication might fail. The accessToken should be obtained through the OAuth 2 process from your Google application credentials.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) for the "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component called "google-calendar-stream", and is this option marked as required?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientSecret" option within the "google-calendar-stream" Apache Camel component is designed for securing your calendar application by providing a secret key that helps authenticate your application with Google''s OAuth2 system. The default value for this option is null, which means you must provide your own client secret during setup. This option is not marked as required, so using it is optional when interacting with Google Calendar through the "google-calendar-stream" component. However, it is strongly recommended to always use a client secret for enhanced security when accessing sensitive data.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the optional "emailAddress" option within the "google-calendar-stream" component of Apache Camel, specifically in terms of its relevance to the security group?'
      answer: |
       'The "emailAddress" option within the "google-calendar-stream" component of Apache Camel is an optional parameter that specifies the email address of the Google Service Account. It''s relevant to the security group as it enables you to authenticate your application using service accounts in order to access the Google Calendar API on behalf of users without having to handle their credentials directly. When this option is not specified, it has a default value of null, meaning that it will not be used if left unset.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value, if any, for the "p12FileName" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-calendar-stream"? Also, is this option required? If not, does it belong to a specific group of options related to security in the context of the component configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "p12FileName" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-calendar-stream" is designed for specifying the name of the .p12 file that contains the private key for the Google Service Account. By default, it has no preset value. This option is optional and belongs to a specific group called "security", indicating its role in safeguarding sensitive details while configuring the component.'
    - question: 'How does one configure the `refreshToken` option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar stream component to provide a new access token when the current one expires, ensuring the longevity of the application''s access?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the `refreshToken` option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar stream component for obtaining a new access token when the current one expires, ensuring the longevity of your application''s access, you can provide a valid OAuth 2 refresh token as a string. This optional parameter allows the Google Calendar component to request a new access token whenever the existing token expires. Make sure to include this configuration under the security group when setting up your Apache Camel routes.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and format of the "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", and is it required for using this component? Additionally, could you please explain how to provide a service account key in base64 format when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" is intended for providing a service account key in JSON format to authenticate an application as a service account with Google Calendar API. This option is not mandatory, as its usage is marked as "required: false." When you want to provide your service account key in base64 format, prefix it with ''base64:'' before the actual Base64-encoded string to ensure correct decoding and processing by the component. For example, if your Base64-encoded string is ''YWRtaW4='', the input for this option would be ''base64:YWRtaW4=''.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "user" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", and how can you configure it, if needed, for security purposes?'
      answer: |
       'The "user" option within the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" serves a security-related purpose, specifically for impersonating a specific user when using a service account in the flow. This means that the application can perform actions as if it were the identified user rather than itself. If you wish to configure this option for additional security, you can provide the email address of the user you''d like the application to impersonate in the Google Calendar API request. Please note that this option is optional and may not be required in every scenario, but if it''s needed, you can set its value as a string containing the user''s email address.'
    - question: 'What is the optional string parameter named `applicationName` within the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" and for what purpose does it serve when setting up a consumer, specifically if I don''t provide this parameter with any value?'
      answer: |
       'The `applicationName` parameter in the Apache Camel component `google-calendar-stream` is an optional string that can be provided to specify the name of the Google Calendar application. Although not required, setting the `applicationName` can help distinguish your application among multiple integrations with Google Calendar, if such situations arise. If you don''t provide a value for this parameter when setting up a consumer, it will default to no specific value.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the `calendarId` option in the Apache Camel''s Google Calendar Stream component when it is not specified explicitly by the user?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `calendarId` option in Apache Camel''s Google Calendar Stream component is "primary" if not specified explicitly by the user.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-calendar-stream"? Additionally, is it required and under which group does it belong?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-calendar-stream" serves the purpose of providing the Client ID of your Google Calendar application. This value is not predefined or supplied by default, so you will need to provide it yourself when configuring the component. Its presence is optional but the group under which this option can be found is "consumer".'
    - question: 'How does the "considerLastUpdate" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" function, and is it required for using this component? Additionally, can you explain its default value and how it affects the start date for the next poll?'
      answer: |
       'The "considerLastUpdate" option within the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" is an optional boolean setting (its default value is false). When set to true, this option tells the component to take the timestamp of the last event polled as the starting point for the next poll, rather than starting from the beginning each time. In other words, it allows you to continue your data stream from where the previous poll left off instead of resetting the start date. This can be beneficial if you want to optimize performance by reducing unnecessary requests.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `consumeFromNow` option in the Apache Camel''s Google Calendar Stream component, and is it required for its use? Furthermore, what is its default value, and how can its setting be adjusted if needed?'
      answer: |
       'The `consumeFromNow` option in Apache Camel''s Google Calendar Stream component is designed to consume events from the selected calendar starting from the current time. This means that it will start fetching events happening from the present moment onwards. However, it is not mandatory for its use, as it can be set as false if you wish to consume events from a specific date and time in the past or at regular intervals. Its default value is true, which implies it will start consuming events from now by default. If you need to adjust its setting, you can do so by explicitly specifying false when configuring this option during integration with your Camel routes.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''delegate'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-calendar-stream'', and is it required or optional? Furthermore, could you provide an example of how this option might be set if using a wide-domain service account?'
      answer: |
       'The ''delegate'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-calendar-stream'' allows for delegation of authority to another user within a wide-domain service account. This means that the service account can act as if it were a different user when interacting with Google Calendar. It is an optional configuration, and its value can be set to a string representing the user ID of the delegate. Here''s an example of how this option might be set in case you''re using a wide-domain service account:       ```       googleCalendarStream(delegate = "user_id@example.com")           .to("google-calendar:///calendars/{calendarId}?method=EVENTS&user=service_account_email@developer.gserviceaccount.com")       ```       In the example above, the service account email is set as the user in the URL, and the ''delegate'' option is used to specify a different user ID, `user_id@example.com`. This allows the service account to act on behalf of the specified delegate when interacting with Google Calendar.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "maxResults" option when using the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component, and is it required to specify this value during configuration? (Answer: The default value is 10, and it''s optional to specify the number of results to be returned.)'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "maxResults" option when utilizing the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component is 10. However, it''s not compulsory to specify this value during configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "query" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream"? Also, is this option required when configuring the component?'
      answer: |
       'The "query" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" allows you to execute specific queries on Google Calendar. By default, it does not have a value (defaultValue: null), meaning you can choose to provide a query or allow the component to use its default behavior. This option is not required when configuring the component; however, providing a query will enable more targeted results from your Google Calendar interactions.'
    - question: 'What are the possible scopes (permissions) that can be set for the Google Calendar application when using the "scopes" option in Apache Camel''s "google-calendar-stream" component, and is specifying a scope for this option optional?'
      answer: |
       'When utilizing the "scopes" option in Apache Camel''s "google-calendar-stream" component for the Google Calendar application, you can specify various levels of permissions or scopes that the calendar app can access within a user account. These permissions are detailed on the Google Developers website (https://developers.google.com/calendar/auth). Specifying a scope for this option is optional; if not set, it allows for default access which may vary based on the component and your application''s needs.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", and is it required to be set for the consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" serves to send an empty message (without a body) if the polling consumer did not receive any files during its idle period. By default, this feature is disabled (defaultValue: false). Although it''s not required for the consumer to set this option, enabling it can help manage communication consistency when no new data is available.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and compatibility of the syncFlow option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component, and is it a required setting? Also, where can I find more information about this option''s functionality in relation to the Google Calendar API v3?'
      answer: |
       'The `syncFlow` option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component is designed for synchronizing events with the Google Calendar API v3. Please note that it is not compatible with ''query'' and ''considerLastUpdate'' parameters. This setting allows for real-time updating of events on your Google Calendar, which you can find more details about in the documentation here: https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/sync. While not required, you may use it if you wish to have automatic syncing of your events with your Google Calendar API integration.'
    - question: 'How does the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel google-calendar-stream component function and is it possible for this option to be enabled by default, as opposed to relying on the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler by default?'
      answer: |
       'The `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel `google-calendar-stream` component allows you to bridge the consumer to Camel''s routing Error Handler, which means that any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages will be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. However, it''s important to note that this functionality is only possible if the third-party component supports Camel being notified of an exception. Not all components do this internally; some handle exceptions in-house only. In such cases, `bridgeErrorHandler` cannot be enabled. By default, the consumer uses the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler` to manage exceptions, which logs them at WARN or ERROR level and ignores them. The `bridgeErrorHandler` can be manually enabled (set to true), but it is not enabled by default. For future releases, the Camel component may be improved to interface with third-party components, enabling this functionality in more cases.'
    - question: '"In the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component, what happens to exceptions when using the ''exceptionHandler'' option with bridgeErrorHandler disabled?"'
      answer: |
       'When using the ''exceptionHandler'' option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component with bridgeErrorHandler disabled, any exceptions that occur will not be automatically handled by the default consumer behavior. Instead, the consumer will allow you to use a custom ExceptionHandler that can be defined to handle these exceptions according to your requirements. By default, if no ExceptionHandler is specified, exceptions that are logged at the WARN or ERROR level will be ignored by the consumer.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel component Google-Calendar-Stream and what value or types are acceptable for it, considering that it''s an optional setting grouped under "consumer (advanced)"?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel component Google-Calendar-Stream is an advanced setting used to configure the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. It''s worth noting that this option has a default value of null, meaning it can be omitted if not specified. The acceptable values or types for this option are objects, as mentioned in its description. This setting is considered an optional one due to its complex nature and is primarily used by experienced developers under the "consumer (advanced)" group.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom polling strategy for error handling when using the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component, and is it mandatory to provide such a configuration? (Given that the default value is null and it''s in the ''consumer (advanced)'' group)'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom polling strategy for error handling when using the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component, you can override the `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy` option within your route''s configuration. Although providing such a custom implementation is not mandatory, doing so allows you to control error handling during the poll operation before an Exchange is created and routed in Camel, which may prove beneficial for specific use cases found within the ''consumer (advanced)'' group.'
    - question: 'How many error polls should occur after an error before the backoffMultiplier kicks in when using the Google Calendar Stream component in Apache Camel?'
      answer: |
       'When utilizing the Google Calendar Stream component in Apache Camel, the "backoffErrorThreshold" option specifies the number of subsequent error polls that should occur before the "backoffMultiplier" is activated. The default value for this threshold is null, meaning it can be set according to your application''s requirements. This setting helps control the retry mechanism after an error has occurred during polling.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component, and is it required when using this component? Additionally, can you explain how the backoffMultiplier comes into play when this threshold is exceeded?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component is an integer value that determines the number of subsequent idle polls that should occur before the "backoffMultipler" kicks-in. Its default value is null, meaning it can be set at your discretion or not used at all, as its usage is optional.              When a specific number of idle polls (defined by the "backoffIdleThreshold") exceeds, the Google Calendar Stream component starts applying a backoff strategy using the "backoffMultipler". This strategy delays further requests for a period proportional to an exponentially increasing multiplier (the "backoffMultipler"), aiming to reduce the frequency of requests and potential overloading of the server.              In simple terms, "backoffIdleThreshold" sets the threshold for idle polls before activating the backoff strategy defined by "backoffMultipler". This can help manage the load when continuously querying Google Calendar for events while also ensuring efficient handling of your application''s interaction with the API.'
    - question: '"What does the ''backoffMultiplier'' option do in the Apache Camel ''google-calendar-stream'' component, and when should it be used along with other related options?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''backoffMultiplier'' option within the Apache Camel ''google-calendar-stream'' component is used to implement a backoff strategy, allowing the scheduled polling consumer to pause if there has been a sequence of idles or errors. This number represents how many polls will be skipped before another attempt is made again. It is important to note that when using this option, you must configure backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold as well. The ''backoffMultiplier'' should be employed in scenarios where temporary issues might occur with the Google Calendar stream, ensuring a smoother flow of communication between the system and the Google API while minimizing potential error rates or excessive polling.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''delay'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-calendar-stream'', and what is its default value, data type, and whether it is required or not?'
      answer: |
       'The ''delay'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-calendar-stream'' is designed to introduce a delay (in milliseconds) before the next poll is executed. Its purpose is to manage the frequency at which the calendar data is fetched from Google Calendar. The default value of this option is 500 milliseconds, and it falls under the category of ''integer'', meaning it expects an integer as its input. However, it is not a mandatory requirement to specify the delay, as setting it to false or omitting it would mean using the default value.'
    - question: 'What does enabling the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel''s Google Calendar Stream component do to the behavior of the ScheduledPollConsumer, and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel''s Google Calendar Stream component allows the ScheduledPollConsumer to execute again immediately if it has polled one or more messages during its previous run. The default value for this option is false, meaning that it does not have the "greedy" behavior enabled by default.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel component ''google-calendar-stream''? Also, is it mandatory to set a value for this option and which group does it belong to (if applicable)?'
      answer: |
       'The "initialDelay" option within the Apache Camel component ''google-calendar-stream'' is designed to define the milliseconds delay before the first poll starts. Its default value is 1000 (or 1 second). This setting is optional, meaning you can choose to set a specific time if needed but it will run immediately if left unspecified. The group this option belongs to, in terms of organization within the component''s settings, is ''scheduler''.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum number of times a Google Calendar stream in Apache Camel will fire if the "repeatCount" option is set to 5, and what does setting it to 1 or zero mean?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s Google Calendar Stream, when you set the "repeatCount" option to 5, it defines a limit for how many times the scheduled action will fire. Specifically, it means that the action will be triggered up to five separate times.              On the other hand, if you set the "repeatCount" to 1, it signifies that the action will execute only once. Lastly, setting "repeatCount" to 0 or a negative value indicates that the action should repeat indefinitely without a fixed upper limit.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and allowed range of the "runLoggingLevel" option in the Apache Camel''s google-calendar-stream component, and can it be set as optional within the scheduler group?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "runLoggingLevel" option in Apache Camel''s Google Calendar Stream component is TRACE. This option controls the logging level of the consumer when it polls and allows you to configure the log level within a range. It can be set as optional within the scheduler group, meaning you may or may not specify a value for this parameter according to your requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "scheduledExecutorService" option within the Apache Camel''s Google Calendar Stream component and how can it be configured to use a custom or shared thread pool? Also, is it optional, and does it have a default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "scheduledExecutorService" option within the Apache Camel''s Google Calendar Stream component allows for configuring a custom or shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default, each consumer has its own single-threaded thread pool, but you can utilize this option to change that behavior. If you wish to set up a custom or shared thread pool, you can configure it via this option. However, it is worth noting that it is not mandatory, as indicated by the "required: false" attribute, and does not have a default value, as specified by the "defaultValue: null". This setting falls under the "scheduler" group within the component''s configuration options.'
    - question: 'What is the procedure for configuring a cron scheduler for the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component when using either Camel-Spring or Camel-Quartz components?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a cron scheduler for the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component using either the Camel-Spring or Camel-Quartz components, you would specify the "component" as "google-calendar-stream", the "option" as "scheduler", and provide the value as either "spring" or "quartz" to utilize their built-in schedulers. This configuration can be found within the "groups" labeled as "scheduler". If no value is explicitly set, it defaults to being non-scheduled (none).'
    - question: 'How can I set custom properties for a custom scheduler or any Quartz/Spring-based scheduler when using the Google Calendar Stream component in Apache Camel?'
      answer: |
       'To set custom properties for a custom scheduler or any Quartz/Spring-based scheduler while utilizing the Google Calendar Stream component in Apache Camel, you can configure additional properties using the "schedulerProperties" option. This allows you to define any required or optional properties that are specific to your custom scheduling needs. Since the default value for this property is null, you need to explicitly provide the configuration object when initializing the scheduler in your route. The properties defined under "schedulerProperties" will only be considered if the "groups" attribute set for the option includes "scheduler".'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the "startScheduler" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", and is it necessary for the scheduler to be explicitly set to false if one does not want the auto start functionality?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "startScheduler" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" is set to true, meaning that the scheduler will automatically start when using this component. However, if you do not wish to utilize the auto-start functionality, it is not necessary to explicitly set the scheduler to false. The option can be left as it is, with its default value of true, and the scheduler will not be activated if the conditions for triggering it are not met.'
    - question: 'What is the default time unit for setting the `initialDelay` and `delay` options in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component when using its scheduler group, and which type of values can be provided for these settings?'
      answer: |
       'The default time unit for setting the `initialDelay` and `delay` options in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component, when utilizing its scheduler group, is MILLISECONDS. These options can accept values that are either integer numbers or durations (strings representing a specific amount of time followed by a time unit such as ms, sec, min, hr, or even custom durations). The possible time units for these settings include milliseconds (ms), seconds (sec), minutes (min), hours (hr), or any other duration that Apache Camel supports.'
    - question: 'Here''s a potential question about the Apache Camel "google-calendar-stream" component and its option "useFixedDelay":              "When using the ''google-calendar-stream'' component in Apache Camel, what is the purpose of the ''useFixedDelay'' option, and how can you configure it to use a fixed rate instead of a fixed delay for scheduling?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''useFixedDelay'' option for the ''google-calendar-stream'' component in Apache Camel controls whether a fixed delay or fixed rate is used for scheduling. When set to true (its default value), a fixed delay between each execution is used. However, if you want to configure it to use a fixed rate instead, you can do so by setting the option to false and providing an appropriate ''rate'' parameter in your configuration, which will instruct the component to execute at regular intervals based on the provided rate. For details about the implementation of fixed-rate scheduling, please refer to the Java Doc of ScheduledExecutorService in JDK.'
    - question: 'What should be used for a longer period of validity when setting the ''accessToken'' option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component, considering that the OAuth 2 access token usually expires after an hour and the ''refreshToken'' is recommended for long term usage?'
      answer: |
       'For longer period of validity when setting the ''accessToken'' option in the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component, it is recommended to use the ''refreshToken''. This is because the OAuth 2 access token usually expires after an hour, but the refreshToken is intended for long-term usage.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel "google-calendar-stream" component, and is its usage marked as required?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel "google-calendar-stream" component serves the purpose of providing the client secret of your Google Calendar application. This value should be a string and can be omitted since it''s marked as optional ("defaultValue": null, "required": false). However, due to security reasons, you should take care to use this option when setting up integration with your Google Calendar.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) for the ''emailAddress'' option within the ''google-calendar-stream'' component in Apache Camel when setting up a Google Service Account, and is it mandatory to provide this option?'
      answer: |
       'The ''emailAddress'' option within the ''google-calendar-stream'' component in Apache Camel refers to the email address of the Google Service Account. It is used for authentication purposes when accessing Google Calendar data. The default value for this option is null, meaning it does not come with a preset value and must be specified during configuration. Providing an emailAddress is not mandatory; however, if left unspecified, you will need to provide other authentification details like the private key file of your Service Account. Keep in mind that this information falls under the security group due to its sensitive nature.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the optional "p12FileName" setting in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream", which pertains to specifying the name of a .p12 file that contains a private key used with a Google Service Account, and whether it is required for configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "p12FileName" option in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" serves the purpose of specifying the name of a .p12 file that holds your private key associated with a Google Service Account. This setting is optional, meaning it is not required for configuring the component. However, if provided, this would allow you to use a private key from a .p12 file for authentication purposes. The default value for "p12FileName" is null in case no specific file name is specified during configuration. Keep in mind that security is an important consideration here, as this setting handles sensitive information.'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel''s "google-calendar-stream" component handle obtaining a new OAuth 2 token when the current access token has expired, and is it mandatory to provide a refresh token in the configuration if the component supports this functionality?'
      answer: |
       'The Google Calendar stream component in Apache Camel utilizes an OAuth 2 refresh token to obtain a new access token when the current one expires. This is important for long-lived applications, as the refreshed token allows uninterrupted communication between your application and the Google Calendar API. While not mandatory, you can configure a refresh token (as a string) if you want to enable this functionality within the component''s configuration under the security group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, format, default value, and group association of the option "serviceAccountKey" in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream"? Also, is it required for usage?'
      answer: |
       'The option "serviceAccountKey" in the Apache Camel component "google-calendar-stream" is designed to authenticate an application as a service account when using Google Calendar Stream. It requires the service account key in JSON format, but with Base64 encoding added beforehand with the prefix "base64:". By default, it does not have any specified value, meaning you should provide your own. This option belongs to the security group of settings, as it involves handling sensitive data such as API keys. The use of "serviceAccountKey" is optional and not necessarily required for usage of the Google Calendar Stream component, depending on how you prefer to authenticate your application with Google services.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the "user" option within the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option? (Answer: The user option in the Google Calendar Stream component allows you to impersonate a specific user using the service account flow. It has no default value and it''s optional.)'
      answer: |
       'The "user" option within the Apache Camel Google Calendar Stream component is designed to enable the application to impersonate a particular user in the context of the service account flow. This option does not have a default value, meaning you need to specify it only if required. It''s important to note that providing this information can impact the security group, as the use of service accounts requires careful handling due to their access to sensitive resources.'
