    - question: 'Given the information you provided, here''s a possible question:              "In the Apache Camel SSH component, what is the purpose of the option ''failOnUnknownHost'' and what is its default value when not specified?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''failOnUnknownHost'' option in the Apache Camel SSH component specifies whether a connection to an unknown host should fail or not. This setting takes effect only when the knownHosts property has been set. The default value of ''failOnUnknownHost'' is false, which means it does not automatically assume failure when connecting to an unrecognized host.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "knownHostsResource" option within the Apache Camel ssh component, and is it required? Furthermore, where would this option be configured if provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "knownHostsResource" option in the Apache Camel SSH component is used to set the file path for a known_hosts file, which contains a list of IP addresses that have previously connected to the server along with their associated cryptographic hashes. This setting allows your application to verify whether it''s connecting to a machine that it''s already connected to and trusts, helping to prevent potential man-in-the-middle attacks. By default, there is no value set for "knownHostsResource". The usage of this option is optional, as the SSH component can still function without it if it has been previously configured with trusted hosts or keys. If you choose to configure this option, it would be done at the Camel route level within your Camel context XML file or Java code depending on your chosen programming approach for Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the default timeout value, in milliseconds, for the Apache Camel SSH component when setting up an SSH connection, and can it be optionally configured? (Answer: The default timeout is 30000 milliseconds, and it can be optionally configured.)'
      answer: |
       'The default timeout value, in milliseconds, for the Apache Camel SSH component when establishing an SSH connection is 30000 milliseconds. This can be optionally configured if desired.'
    - question: 'How does the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel SSH component differ from the default exception handling, and under what conditions can an SSH component utilize the bridgeErrorHandler to bridge the consumer to the routing Error Handler instead of using the default org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler?'
      answer: |
       'The `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel SSH component allows for bridging exceptions that occur while the SSH consumer is attempting to pickup incoming messages to be processed by the routing Error Handler, rather than using the default `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler`. This means that any exceptions can be treated as regular messages and handled within the routing Error Handler. However, for this functionality to work, the third-party component must enable Camel to be notified if an exception was thrown. If a 3rd party component handles exceptions internally, then `bridgeErrorHandler` will not be possible. In such situations, future releases might improve the Camel SSH component to integrate with the third-party component to support this feature. By default, if `bridgeErrorHandler` is not utilized, the consumer will employ the standard exception handling where any exceptions will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of using the pollCommand option in the Apache Camel ssh component when configuring it as a consumer (e.g., from(ssh://...)), and how should the command be terminated for this option to work correctly?'
      answer: |
       'The `pollCommand` option in the Apache Camel ssh component is utilized when you set up the component as a consumer (like `from(ssh://...)`). This configuration sets the command string that will be sent to the remote SSH server during each poll cycle.              To ensure proper functioning, it''s important to terminate your command with a newline. However, the newline character must be URL encoded as "%0A". In other words, if your command is `myCommand`, you would set the `pollCommand` value to `myCommand%0A`. This will allow the SSH server to interpret the command correctly and execute it appropriately during each poll cycle.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the SSH component of Apache Camel affect the behavior of a route, specifically in terms of producer startup and error handling, and what are some considerations to keep in mind when using this feature?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the SSH component of Apache Camel allows for a more flexible and resilient route setup by deferring the startup of the producer until the first message is processed. This can be beneficial when dealing with situations where a producer may otherwise cause a route to fail during starting, due to its dependencies or other reasons.              When using this feature, errors that occur during producer startup will be handled during routing messages via Camel''s routing error handlers, making it possible for the overall CamelContext and routes to successfully initialize.              However, be aware that since the producer starts only upon processing the first message, creating and starting the producer may take some time, potentially extending the total processing duration of each message. This should be carefully considered in applications where quick response times are essential or when dealing with high volumes of messages.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the Apache Camel SSH component''s option ''autowiredEnabled'' influence the configuration process when it comes to automatically configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, and other similar entities within a Camel route? Is it required for this automatic configuration and what is its default value if not explicitly specified?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel SSH component allows for automatic autowiring of components such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, among others, within a Camel route. This means that when ''autowiredEnabled'' is true, Camel will look up in its registry to find a single instance of matching type and automatically configure it for you. While not strictly required for the automatic configuration, having it enabled can simplify your configuration process significantly. The default value for ''autowiredEnabled'' is true, so if you do not explicitly specify it, this option will be activated.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "channelType" option when using the Apache Camel ssh component, and what string values can be provided as alternatives in case a specific channel type is needed during command execution?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "channelType" option when utilizing the Apache Camel SSH component is "exec". If a particular channel type is necessary during command execution, alternative string values that can be provided as alternatives include any supported by your SSH server. However, note that when not specified, it defaults to "exec".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the option "clientBuilder" in the Apache Camel ssh component, and is its usage considered essential or optional within the context of using this component?'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s SSH component, the option "clientBuilder" is an instance of `ClientBuilder`. This object is used by either the producer or consumer to create a new `SshClient` when working with Secure Shell connections. However, it does not have a default value and its usage is considered optional within the context of using this component as indicated by the "groups": "advanced". So, while using clientBuilder can provide flexibility in managing your SSH client settings, you can still effectively use the SSH component without explicitly setting it if you prefer to rely on Camel''s default configurations.'
    - question: 'How do you configure the Apache Camel SSH component to enable or disable data compression during the transfer of files between systems? And are there any default settings for this option?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel SSH component to enable or disable data compression during the file transfer between systems, you need to set the "compressions" option within the component''s configuration. If you wish to use compression, specify the compression method you prefer. If not, simply leave it as null. The default value for this option is null (no compression). You can find this setting under the "advanced" group of options. Here''s an example of how to enable gzip compression:              ```       ssh(...) .compression(CompressionCodec.GZIP)       ```'
    - question: 'What are the possible ways to configure the Apache Camel SSH component in an advanced manner, considering the ''configuration'' option for this component? Does it have any default value and is the use of this configuration optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel SSH component allows you to configure its behavior in an advanced manner through the ''configuration'' option. This option takes an object, which means it accepts key-value pairs for customization. However, it does not have a default value, so you must provide your own configuration if you choose to use it. The usage of this configuration is optional as indicated by the "required": false in the provided information. Furthermore, this configuration is classified under the ''advanced'' group of options, which suggests these settings are for more sophisticated use cases.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel SSH component option named "shellPrompt" and is its usage optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'The "shellPrompt" option within the Apache Camel SSH component is designed to allow you to drop the shell prompt when a response is read after command execution. Its default value is null. The use of this option is optional, as indicated by the group "advanced", meaning it''s not essential for basic operation.'
    - question: 'What is the default value (in milliseconds) for the "sleepForShellPrompt" option under the "Advanced" group of the Apache Camel ssh component, and can this value be overridden?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "sleepForShellPrompt" option in the Advanced group of the Apache Camel SSH component is 100 milliseconds (ms). It can be overridden if needed.'
    - question: '"What is the default value and purpose of the ''healthCheckConsumerEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel SSH component, and can this configuration option be considered mandatory or optional?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''healthCheckConsumerEnabled'' option within the Apache Camel SSH component is used for enabling or disabling all consumer-based health checks originating from this component. By default, this setting is true (enabled), allowing health checks to function as intended. This configuration option can be considered optional; however, if you wish to disable health checks specific to the SSH component, you may set its value to false. The group associated with this setting is ''health''.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the option "healthCheckProducerEnabled" for the Apache Camel SSH component impact the execution of producer-based health checks from this component, considering that it is turned off by default and can be globally activated by setting the property "camel.health.producersEnabled=true"?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "healthCheckProducerEnabled" option for the Apache Camel SSH component allows producer-based health checks from this component to be performed. By default, these checks are disabled in Camel. However, you can enable them globally across all components by setting the property "camel.health.producersEnabled=true". If you set "healthCheckProducerEnabled" to true for the SSH component specifically, it will only impact health checks for that component, while leaving other components unaffected if they have their own health check settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `certResource` option in the Apache Camel SSH component, how can it be configured, what type of value does it accept, if its use is optional, and which security group does this configuration option belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The `certResource` option in the Apache Camel SSH component is designed to set the resource path of the certificate for authentication purposes. If this option is used, it will utilize the ResourceHelperKeyPairProvider to resolve file-based certificates, depending on the value set for keyType. It accepts a string type of value and its usage is optional. This configuration option falls under the "security" group in Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''certResourcePassword'' option in the Apache Camel SSH component, and is it a required setting when configuring this component? Also, what group of options does it belong to within the context of the SSH component?'
      answer: |
       'The ''certResourcePassword'' option in the Apache Camel SSH component is designed to set the password for decrypting an encrypted key (certResource) when required. If certResource isn''t specified, no default value will be assigned to this option because it relies on an external variable. The use of this option is optional as you can configure the SSH component without providing a password for certResource. This option falls under the ''security'' group within the context of the SSH component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the "ciphers" option within the Apache Camel ssh component, and are there any specific security groups associated with it?'
      answer: |
       'The "ciphers" option in the Apache Camel SSH component is used to specify a comma-separated list of allowed or supported ciphers in their order of preference for encryption during SSH connections. It does not have a default value. This option falls under the "security" groups, indicating its relevance to the overall security configuration during data transfer through the SSH channel.'
    - question: 'What are the possible valid, comma-separated orders of key exchange algorithms that can be set as a preference for the SSH component''s KEX (Key Exchange Algorithm) option in Apache Camel, if security considerations dictate that it should use one or more specific algorithms? Can you also explain what this option does and provide an example of how to set it during configuration?              The description given indicates that the KEX option allows a comma-separated list of allowed/supported key exchange algorithms in their order of preference. It is an optional parameter, with the default value being null. The groups are categorized under "security".              In other words, you might want to configure it like so:       ```       ssh("your-remote-server")         .kex("ecdh-sha2-nistp521,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp256,diffie-hellman-group14-sha256,diffie-hellman-group15-sha1")         // rest of your route here...       ```       This example shows that ECDH algorithms (with SHA2-NISTP521, -NISTP384, and -NISTP256 preferences) along with diffie-hellman groups 14 and 15 are allowed/supported for key exchange. The list should be ordered by preference of use in case multiple options are presented during the key exchange negotiation.'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s SSH component, the KEX (Key Exchange Algorithm) option allows you to set a comma-separated list of allowed/supported key exchange algorithms in their order of preference for increased security. The list should be provided when configuring the component, as shown in your example:              ```       ssh("your-remote-server")         .kex("ecdh-sha2-nistp521,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp256,diffie-hellman-group14-sha256,diffie-hellman-group15-sha1")         // rest of your route here...       ```              In this example, ECDH algorithms (EC Diffie-Hellman) with SHA-2 (SHA2-NISTP521, -NISTP384, and -NISTP256) are preferred, followed by diffie-hellman groups 14 and 15 with SHA-1 and SHA-256 respectively. The order of the list defines the preference, so the SSH component will use the first algorithm in the list that is supported by both ends when key exchange negotiation occurs. By providing this configuration, you ensure that the SSH connection uses a secure key exchange method that best suits your requirements while considering security considerations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel `keyPairProvider` option in the `ssh` component, and is its use optional or required?'
      answer: |
       'The `keyPairProvider` option within the SSH component in Apache Camel is designed to set a reference for a KeyPairProvider object when establishing an SSH connection with certificate-based authentication. This means that you can specify how your client obtains the necessary key pair (private key and public key) for connecting securely to the remote server using certificates. By default, it does not have a predefined value, which indicates that you can choose to provide one or use the system''s default settings if applicable. Lastly, the use of this option is considered optional as its requirement can depend on your specific use case and authentication preferences with SSH connections, falling under the "security" category in Apache Camel''s configurations.'
    - question: 'What key types can be passed to the `keyType` option in the Apache Camel SSH component for authentication purposes, and how does the selection of key type behave in different versions (prior to and after Camel 3.0.0 / 2.25.0)? Also, is the specification of a default key type required?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel SSH component, the `keyType` option can be set to pass a specific key type for authentication purposes during connection. The accepted values are strings representing the different types of SSH keys, such as ''ssh-rsa'', ''ssh-dsa'', or ''ecdsa''.              Prior to Camel 3.0.0 / 2.25.0, by default Camel enforced a key type of ''ssh-rsa''. However, starting from these versions, the component will automatically select the first available KeyPair that is loaded, regardless of the key type (defaults to ''ssh-rsa'' if no other options are specified).              It''s important to note that the specification of a default keyType is not required when using the SSH component; it''s optional with the mentioned behavior depending on the version of Apache Camel. The relevant group for this setting is ''security''.'
    - question: 'What are the default and supported Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms for the SSH component in Apache Camel, when it comes to ensuring data integrity protection, and are there any preferences in their use if more than one is specified? Also, can this option be set or is it optional?'
      answer: |
       'The Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms for the SSH component in Apache Camel are not set to a default value by default. However, you can specify a comma-separated list of supported MAC algorithms in their order of preference for ensuring data integrity protection. If more than one algorithm is specified, they will be used in the given order. The use of this option is optional, but it falls under the security group of configurations.'
    - question: 'How does one configure the Apache Camel ssh component to specify a password for connecting to an SSH server, given that it''s optional and only works when the `keyPairProvider` is set to null?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel SSH component to specify a password for connecting to an SSH server, you should ensure that the `keyPairProvider` is set to null, since using a password connection option is only available when this property is not defined. You can then use the "password" option to set the required password. For example:              ```java       SshComponent ssh = new SshComponent();       ssh.setPassword("your_password");       ssh.setKeyPairProvider(null);       ...       producerTemplate.send("direct:myRoute", exchange -> {           exchange.getIn().setHeader("CamelSshHost", "ssh.example.com");           exchange.getIn().setBody("Your command to run on the remote server");           exchange.setProperty(Exchange.REMOTE_ADDR, "your_username@ssh.example.com");           exchange.setComponent(ssh);       });       ```'
    - question: 'What comma-separated list of signature algorithms is preferred for the Apache Camel SSH component, in case the user opts to specify this option for enhanced security? And, is it necessary to provide this option when using the SSH component in Apache Camel?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel SSH component allows you to specify a comma-separated list of signature algorithms for enhanced security, if preferred. This list denotes the order of priority of the supported/allowed signature algorithms. However, it''s important to note that providing this option is not necessary; it''s an optional setting under the "security" group in the component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "username" option in the Apache Camel ssh component, and can it be left empty if the default value is not set? Furthermore, what data type is expected for this option, and where does this option fall under in terms of required or optional use?'
      answer: |
       'The "username" option in the Apache Camel SSH component sets the username to be used when logging into a remote SSH server. It''s not necessary to specify a username if a default value has been set, but leaving it empty when no default value is provided would result in the username field being blank during SSH connection. For this option, Apache Camel expects a string data type. In terms of required or optional use, the "username" option can be left unset if a default username is provided; otherwise, it falls under the category of an optional setting, grouped under ''security''.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and requirements for the Apache Camel SSH component option ''failOnUnknownHost'' when the property ''knownHosts'' is not specified? Also, what will happen if a connection is attempted to an unknown host under this scenario?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of the Apache Camel SSH component, if the property ''knownHosts'' is not explicitly set, the default behavior for the option ''failOnUnknownHost'' is false. This means that a connection attempt to an unknown host will not cause the process to fail; it will continue as planned, even though there might be potential security risks associated with connecting to an unrecognized server. However, keep in mind that the validation of this setting only occurs when ''knownHosts'' is specified. Therefore, it is generally recommended to utilize a properly configured ''knownHosts'' for secure connections.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "knownHostsResource" option in the Apache Camel SSH component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "knownHostsResource" option in the Apache Camel SSH component is an optional string parameter that sets the resource path for a known_hosts file. By default, it has no default value. This option is used to specify where your application should find or place the list of known hosts for secure Shell connections. This can be helpful when dealing with multiple servers or environments.'
    - question: 'What is the default timeout value (in milliseconds) for establishing an SSH connection using Apache Camel''s SSH component, and can this setting be changed if required?'
      answer: |
       'The default timeout value for establishing an SSH connection using Apache Camel''s SSH component is 30000 milliseconds (or 30 seconds). If you need to adjust this, you can set the "timeout" option in your configuration. This option allows you to specify a custom timeout in milliseconds to wait while connecting to the remote SSH server.'
    - question: 'How does one specify a custom command to execute on each poll cycle when using the Apache Camel SSH consumer (from(ssh://...)), and is it necessary to URL-encode the newline character if a command ends with a newline?'
      answer: |
       'To specify a custom command for execution during each poll cycle when using the Apache Camel SSH consumer (from(ssh://...)), you can use the "option" named "pollCommand". This option sets the command string to send to the remote SSH server.              In regards to your question about URL-encoding the newline character, it is recommended to URL-encode the %0A if a command ends with a newline. This is because the component expects properly encoded values for configuration parameters when using it in the URI format from(ssh://...).'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel SSH component''s "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option and when should it be enabled or disabled? Is there a default value for this option, and can it be required in the configuration of an SSH consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel SSH component serves to control what message gets sent when the polling consumer does not find any files to process during its idle time. Enabling this option results in an empty message (without any body) being sent instead, as opposed to nothing at all. This can be useful for keeping up the appearance of activity or signaling that the consumer is still running even though there are no new files to process. It should be noted that this option has a default value of false, meaning it''s not enabled by default. Furthermore, the configuration of this option as "required" in an SSH consumer setup can be set to false, which means that the consumer will operate correctly whether or not this option is explicitly defined during the setup process.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel SSH component option "bridgeErrorHandler", and under what conditions would it be set to true? Additionally, what happens when it''s not used or set to its default value (false)?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel SSH "bridgeErrorHandler" option allows you to bridge consumer errors to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to retrieve incoming messages will be treated as messages and managed by the routing Error Handler, instead of being logged and ignored (as they would with the default exception handler).              The "bridgeErrorHandler" can only be set to true if the third-party SSH component supports notifying Camel when an exception is thrown. Some components handle exceptions internally, so in these cases, setting "bridgeErrorHandler" is not possible. However, future improvements to the Camel component may allow for this connection to the third-party component, making it feasible for future releases.              When "bridgeErrorHandler" is not used or set to its default value (false), the consumer will use the default exception handler, logging exceptions at WARN or ERROR level and then ignoring them.'
    - question: 'What custom action can be taken when an exception occurs in an Apache Camel SSH consumer using a custom ExceptionHandler, and when is the default behavior of logging and ignoring exceptions applicable? Is it necessary to provide a custom ExceptionHandler if the bridgeErrorHandler option is enabled, and how can we configure this custom ExceptionHandler?'
      answer: |
       'When an exception occurs in an Apache Camel SSH consumer, you can implement a custom action by using a custom ExceptionHandler. However, if the bridgeErrorHandler option is enabled, the use of this option for a custom ExceptionHandler will be overridden. By default, exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level will be handled in this manner and ignored by the consumer. If you wish to define your own behavior for handling exceptions, you can configure the custom ExceptionHandler as part of the advanced consumer group in your Camel application. The configuration requires an object type, but no default value is provided, meaning you''ll need to explicitly set it up according to your requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel ssh option named "exchangePattern" in the context of the consumer, and what is its default value, as well as whether its use is considered required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel "ssh" option named "exchangePattern", when used within the context of a consumer, determines the pattern of data exchange between the producer and consumer when an exchange is created by the consumer while establishing an SSH connection. Its default value is null, meaning no specific data exchange pattern is set initially. The use of this option is considered optional as indicated by the "required": false property in its configuration. However, it falls under the advanced group named "consumer (advanced)" suggesting that it may be useful for more complex scenarios and can be utilized when the need arises to fine-tune data exchange patterns within an SSH connection.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `pollStrategy` option within the Apache Camel SSH component, what type of value can it accept, and under which advanced group settings is it located when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The `pollStrategy` option within the Apache Camel SSH component is designed to enable custom error handling during the poll operation before an Exchange (a message that carries data in Camel) has been created and routed. It allows you to provide a custom implementation of `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy`. The value it accepts is an object, but can be null by default. This option is located under the advanced group settings called "consumer (advanced)" when using this component.'
    - question: 'How does the ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Apache Camel SSH component affect the behavior of the producer, and under what circumstances would it be beneficial to set it to true rather than the default value of false?'
      answer: |
       'The ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Apache Camel SSH component determines whether the producer should start up lazily, that is, only when the first message is processed. This can be useful when a producer may initially fail during starting, causing the entire route to fail as well. By deferring the startup until needed, you can manage startup failures through Camel''s routing error handlers, ensuring a more graceful and controlled startup for your routes and CamelContext.              However, be aware that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some additional time, which could prolong the overall processing time. This setting can prove beneficial in scenarios where you anticipate potential production issues upon startup but want to ensure successful routing once the initial hiccups are handled. The ''lazyStartProducer'' option falls under the ''producer (advanced)'' group of configuration settings, signifying its more specialized use.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible optional values for the Apache Camel SSH component option called ''channelType'', and when might it be useful to set this option explicitly, given its description as "Sets the channel type to pass to the Channel as part of command execution. Defaults to exec."?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel SSH component''s ''channelType'' option is ''exec''. However, you can set it explicitly to other string values if needed. This option allows you to change the channel type passed to the Channel during command execution. Since the default value already executes commands, you might choose to set this option when you want to use a different channel type such as forwarding (ftp, direct, dynamo), allocpty (for allocating a pseudoterminal), or socket (to use raw sockets). These cases would typically occur when specific use cases demand non-exec behaviors for your command execution.'
    - question: 'How is an instance of `ClientBuilder` utilized within an Apache Camel `ssh` component''s producer or consumer to create a customized `SshClient`, and if it''s possible, what options can be configured when using it? (Considering only advanced settings)'
      answer: |
       'In the context of an Apache Camel SSH component, the `ClientBuilder` is an optional feature that allows for the creation of a customized `SshClient`. By instantiating the `ClientBuilder` object, you can configure various aspects of the SSH client to suit your specific requirements (hence the "advanced" group tag). When using this instance within a producer or consumer, the builder serves as a means to construct a new `SshClient`, allowing you to tailor its behavior. Although no default value is provided for the `ClientBuilder` (as stated by the defaultValue: null), you can configure options such as setting up custom connection parameters, defining specific authentication mechanisms, or even configuring advanced features like channeling and keypair management. It''s essential to refer to the SSH component documentation for more information regarding the available configuration options within the `ClientBuilder`.'
    - question: 'What are the available options for the "compressions" parameter under the advanced group in the Apache Camel SSH component, and is there a default value specified for this option?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of the Apache Camel SSH component, the "compressions" parameter is located within the advanced group. This option determines whether data transfers should be compressed (if set) and which compression algorithm to use if chosen. However, there is no default value specified for this option. You can manually configure the compression type when setting up your Camel SSH component.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the Apache Camel SSH component''s `shellPrompt` option to drop the shell prompt when reading a response after command execution, if this option is optional and not set by default?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel SSH component''s `shellPrompt` option to drop the shell prompt when reading a response after command execution, you can set its value explicitly as "dropped" or any other suitable string that indicates this behavior when the `shellPrompt` option is not required (defaults to null). Keep in mind that this configuration is considered advanced, and should be utilized with caution.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "sleepForShellPrompt" option in the Apache Camel ssh component, and can it be configured as a required option? (Answer: Default value is 100 milliseconds, Data Type is integer, and it can be configured but is not required by default.)'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "sleepForShellPrompt" option in the Apache Camel SSH component is 100 milliseconds. Its data type is an integer, and it can be configured, although it is not a required option by default.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel ssh component option named "backoffErrorThreshold" and when is it optional to use? Additionally, could you please specify the group this option belongs to?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffErrorThreshold" option for the Apache Camel SSH component determines the number of subsequent errors (polls that fail due to some error) before the "backoffMultipler" should activate. Its default value is null, meaning it may not have a predefined value and can be set manually. It''s an optional configuration as indicated by the "required": false in its definition. The group this option belongs to is named "scheduler".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel SSH component option named "backoffIdleThreshold", and is it required when using this component within the scheduler group?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel SSH component is an optional setting, belonging to the "scheduler" groups. Its purpose is to define the number of consecutive idle polls that should transpire before the "backoffMultiplier" should activate. By default, it doesn''t have a value assigned, allowing you to configure this parameter according to your specific use-case needs.'
    - question: 'How does configuring the "backoffMultiplier" option within the Apache Camel SSH component affect the scheduler''s polling mechanism, particularly when there are consecutive idle or error events? And could you please explain why it is important to configure backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold alongside the backoffMultiplier option?'
      answer: |
       'Configuring the "backoffMultiplier" option within the Apache Camel SSH component affects the scheduler''s polling mechanism by enabling a delay or skip in attempts when consecutive idle or error events occur. The value assigned to backoffMultiplier denotes the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is made again, thus giving time for any issues that might have arisen to be resolved.              It is crucial to configure backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold alongside backoffMultiplier because they define the number of idle or error events required for the scheduler to initiate the backoff process. If an idle event exceeds the backoffIdleThreshold, or an error occurs a number of times greater than backoffErrorThreshold, the component will enter the backoff phase defined by the backoffMultiplier option. This configuration combination helps manage the overall flow and robustness of your Camel route.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the millisecond delay between SSH polls using Apache Camel''s SSH component? What is the default value and what data type should be used for this configuration option? Also, is it a mandatory setting to include in the component''s configuration?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the millisecond delay between SSH polls using Apache Camel''s SSH component, you can modify the "delay" option under the "scheduler" group. This option defines the number of milliseconds before the next poll, allowing you to adjust the rate at which SSH sessions are checked. The default value for this option is 500 milliseconds (0.5 seconds). Since the "required" property for this option is set to false, it''s not necessary to include this setting in your component''s configuration if you wish to use the default value. The type of data that should be used for this configuration option is an integer.'
    - question: 'What is the effect on the ScheduledPollConsumer''s behavior in an Apache Camel SSH component when the ''greedy'' option is enabled?'
      answer: |
       'When the ''greedy'' option is enabled for the SSH component in Apache Camel, it causes the ScheduledPollConsumer to execute again immediately if the previous run retrieved one or more messages. This means that instead of waiting for the scheduled interval, the consumer will poll for new messages as soon as it has received some during a previous run. If ''greedy'' is not enabled (its default value is false), the consumer behaves according to its schedule, pausing until the next scheduled poll time after each run.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the optional Apache Camel SSH component option "initialDelay", and can this setting be considered as a part of the scheduler group?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel SSH component option "initialDelay" is an integer with the value 1000 milliseconds, which means one second before the first poll starts. This setting can be considered part of the scheduler group, as it relates to controlling the delay before initial execution in a scheduled scenario.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum limit for number of times an SSH operation can be repeated using Apache Camel''s SSH component if it''s set in the ''repeatCount'' option, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The maximum limit for repeating an SSH operation using Apache Camel''s SSH component can be specified through the ''repeatCount'' option. If you set a positive integer value for it, the scheduler will only fire that specific number of times. For instance, if you set it to 5, the operation will execute only five times. It is important to note that a value of zero or negative means the operation will run indefinitely without any limit. The default value for ''repeatCount'' is 0.'
    - question: 'How can I change the logging level of the start/complete log lines generated by the "poll" operation in an Apache Camel SSH consumer, and what are the available logging levels I can set it to if I choose to customize it?'
      answer: |
       'To customize the logging level of the start/complete log lines generated by the "poll" operation in an Apache Camel SSH consumer, you can adjust the "runLoggingLevel" option. This option is set to its default value of TRACE, but you have the freedom to change it if needed. The available logging levels for configuration are: SEVERE, WARNING, INFO, CONFIG, FINEST, FINER, FINE, ALL, and OFF. Adjust this setting based on your desired level of detail or verbosity in your log output.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom or shared thread pool using the scheduledExecutorService option in the Apache Camel SSH component for consumers, and what is the default setting if this configuration is not provided?'
      answer: |
       'In response to your query, to configure a custom or shared thread pool for the consumer in the Apache Camel SSH component using the `scheduledExecutorService` option, you can specify an instance of `Executors.newScheduledThreadPool()` or any other Executor service implementation that fits your use case. By default, each consumer has its own single-threaded thread pool, but by utilizing the `scheduledExecutorService` option, you have the flexibility to use a multi-threaded pool if required. If no explicit configuration is provided for this option, the default setting will be using individual single-threaded thread pools per consumer.'

This configuration falls under the scheduler group in the context of your components.'
    - question: 'How can I set up custom properties when configuring the Apache Camel SSH component to work with a custom scheduler or Quartz/Spring-based scheduler, and what type of value can be assigned to those properties?'
      answer: |
       'To set up custom properties when configuring the Apache Camel SSH component in conjunction with a custom scheduler or Quartz/Spring-based scheduler, you can assign an object value to the "schedulerProperties" option. This option allows you to configure additional properties that are not covered by the default settings. However, it is important to note that no default value is assigned to this property, meaning you will have to provide your own custom objects as per your specific requirements. You can find this setting within the "scheduler" group when configuring your Camel route or component settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and if it''s possible to disable the automatic start of the scheduler when using the Apache Camel SSH component, considering that the option is named ''startScheduler''?'

      answer: |
       'The default time unit for setting the initialDelay and delay options in the Apache Camel SSH component''s scheduler, when no explicit time unit is provided, is Milliseconds (MILLISECONDS). This information can be deduced from the properties of the "timeUnit" option within the component.'
    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel component "ssh" affect its scheduling behavior, compared to the default setting, and what group of configuration options does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel SSH component will alter its scheduling behavior from using a fixed rate (as per its default setting) to employing a fixed delay. This means that, instead of executing tasks at a constant interval, the SSH component will now wait a specified time after each task before starting the next one. It belongs to the "scheduler" group of configuration options in your Camel application. For more information on how this works, you may refer to ScheduledExecutorService in the Java Development Kit (JDK) for details.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel SSH option named "certResource," and is it required when using this component? Also, in what context does the use of the "keyType" setting impact the resolution of the certificate file based on the "certResource"?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel SSH option "certResource" sets the path to the resource of the certificate used for authentication purposes. By default, it doesn''t have a preset value (defaultValue: null). The usage of this option relies on the keyType setting, as it depends on the ResourceHelperKeyPairProvider to resolve the file-based certificate when keyType is specified. When working with the SSH component in the "security" group, the provision of the certResource option is not mandatory since it has a default value of null, but supplying it can enable more customized and secure connections. In relation to the keyType setting, the specific type (such as RSA, DSA, etc.) determines how the certificate file will be resolved based on the provided "certResource".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "certResourcePassword" option within the Apache Camel "ssh" component, and is it required for the operation of this component? Additionally, what type of data does this option handle and which security group is associated with it?'
      answer: |
       'The "certResourcePassword" option within the Apache Camel "ssh" component sets a password to use when loading an encrypted key (certResource) if necessary. Its default value is null, meaning no password is set by default. This option is not required for the operation of the "ssh" component, as its usage depends on whether you''re working with an encrypted key (certResource). The data this option handles is a string, and it belongs to the "security" group due to its role in managing sensitive information related to the encryption process.'
