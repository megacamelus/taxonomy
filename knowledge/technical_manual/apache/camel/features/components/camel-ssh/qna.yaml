    - question: 'How does setting the `failOnUnknownHost` option in the Apache Camel SSH component affect the behavior of connecting to an unknown host, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `failOnUnknownHost` option in the Apache Camel SSH component determines the behavior when attempting to connect to an unknown host. If set to true, the connection will fail when the specified host is not recognized by the known hosts list. Conversely, if set to false, the connection will proceed even when the host is unknown. The default value of this option is false.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel SSH component option named ''knownHostsResource'', and is it required when using this option?'
      answer: |
       'The ''knownHostsResource'' option in the Apache Camel SSH component sets the path for a known_hosts file, which is used to quickly identify remote hosts without having to ask the user every time. The default value for this option is null, meaning it can be set individually for each usage. Using this option is not mandatory; its inclusion depends on your specific needs and configurations within the common group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the Apache Camel SSH component''s timeout option, and how can this value be changed if desired?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Timeout option in the Apache Camel SSH component is 30000 milliseconds (or 30 seconds). If you wish to change this value, you can do so by adjusting the timeout parameter when configuring your SSH component. For instance, to set a timeout of 20000 milliseconds (or 20 seconds), you might write:              timeout=20000              This modification will apply whenever you are using the Apache Camel SSH component in your integration projects.'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel SSH component handle exceptions when using the bridgeErrorHandler option is disabled, compared to when it''s enabled? And under what conditions can the use of bridgeErrorHandler be possible for a given third-party component?'
      answer: |
       'When the Apache Camel SSH component operates with the bridgeErrorHandler option disabled, any exceptions that occur while consuming incoming messages are logged at either WARN or ERROR level and subsequently ignored. The consumer uses the default org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to manage these exceptions.              On the other hand, when bridgeErrorHandler is enabled, exceptions experienced by the Camel consumer while handling incoming messages are processed as messages and managed by the routing Error Handler instead of being logged and ignored. However, the use of bridgeErrorHandler is contingent upon the 3rd party component allowing Camel to be notified if an exception was thrown. Some components manage exceptions internally only, in which case bridgeErrorHandler cannot be utilized. In situations where the Camel component can integrate with the 3rd party component, it may become feasible to employ bridgeErrorHandler in future releases.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "pollCommand" option in the Apache Camel ssh component, when should it be used, and how can it be properly formatted if it contains a newline character?'
      answer: |
       'The "pollCommand" option in the Apache Camel sSH component is utilized to set the command string that will be sent to the remote sSH server during each poll cycle. It''s important to note that this option functions exclusively when the camel-sSH component is employed as a consumer, specifically within the context of from(ssh://...).              If your command string includes a newline character, you must URL encode it as %0A to ensure proper formatting. For instance, if your command is "ls -l", and you wish to add a newline followed by another command "grep error", the encoded command would be "ls -l%0Agrep error".              This option can be beneficial when you need to execute custom commands on the remote server during each poll cycle rather than just running the default sSH command.'
    - question: 'Given the information provided, here''s a potential question:              "Can you explain the purpose of the ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Apache Camel SSH component and under what circumstances might it be beneficial to set it to true?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Apache Camel SSH component allows you to control whether the producer should be started immediately during the initial startup of your CamelContext or only when the first message is processed (lazily). By setting it to true, you can ensure that your routes can still start up even if a specific producer may fail during the initial startup. This is particularly useful in situations where the failure of a producer might cause the entire route to fail being started.              When ''lazyStartProducer'' is set to true, the producer will not be created and started until the first message is processed through the route. If creating or starting the producer takes some time, this can prolong the total processing time of that message. However, it allows you to handle startup failures more gracefully by using Camel''s routing error handlers during message processing.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the Apache Camel SSH component option named "autowiredEnabled", and when would it be beneficial to set this option to false?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel SSH component option called "autowiredEnabled" is a boolean property that determines whether autowiring is enabled for automatic configuration of components such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, etc. Its default value is true, meaning autowiring is activated by default.              Setting this option to false would be beneficial in cases where you want to explicitly configure the SSH component manually instead of allowing Camel to automatically find and configure it based on the registry. This can be useful when you need more fine-grained control over the configuration, or if you have specific requirements that cannot be met by automatic configuration.'
    - question: 'What are the possible values for the Apache Camel SSH component''s "channelType" option, and what is its default value? Is it necessary to specify this option for basic usage of the ssh component?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel SSH component''s "channelType" option allows you to set the channel type when executing commands. The possible values for this option are strings, with the default value being ''exec''. Specifying this option is optional for basic usage of the ssh component as it defaults to ''exec'', but advanced users may find it useful for customizing command execution.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the Apache Camel component ssh option named `clientBuilder`, and is it required for use in Camel routes?'
      answer: |
       'The SshClientBuilder option in Apache Camel''s SSH component is an instance used by either the producer or consumer to create a new SshClient. It''s not mandatory to use it, as its requirement depends on your specific needs and can be found under advanced settings. By default, there is no predefined value for SshClientBuilder; you need to define it according to your requirements when creating routes that utilize the SSH component.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the Apache Camel SSH component to enable or disable data compression when transferring files using the ''compressions'' option in advanced settings? Is there a default value for this configuration, and what types of values are acceptable?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel SSH component regarding data compression when transferring files, you can modify the "compressions" option under the "advanced" group. This option determines whether to use compression (set it to a value indicating the compression method) or not (leave it null). The acceptable values are those recognized by the underlying SSH library, such as ''zlib'' or ''none''. By default, there is no predefined value for this configuration, meaning you need to explicitly set it if you wish to enable or disable data compression.'
    - question: 'What is the possibility and nature (i.e., optional or required) of configuring the Apache Camel SSH component, if any default value is provided for this configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel SSH component allows for the possibility of configuration, as indicated by the "component":"ssh" and "description":"Component configuration". However, there''s no predefined default value for this configuration, as suggested by the "defaultValue":null. Whether you must provide a configuration or not is optional, as stated by "required":false. This configuration falls under the advanced category of settings, denoted by "groups":"advanced".'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel SSH component''s shellPrompt option to drop the shell prompt from the response when a command is executed, if this configuration is optional and not required by default?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel SSH component''s shellPrompt option to drop the shell prompt from the response when a command is executed, you can set its value to an empty string (""). This configuration is optional and can be found under the "advanced" group. If you wish to disable the shell prompt, simply assign an empty string to this option during your Camel route configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value of the "sleepForShellPrompt" option for the Apache Camel SSH component, and can this value be overridden if required? Also, in what group does this advanced option belong?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "sleepForShellPrompt" option in the Apache Camel SSH component is 100 milliseconds. If needed, you can override this value as this option is not mandatory. This advanced option belongs to the group "advanced".'
    - question: 'How does one configure whether to enable or disable all consumer-based health checks for the Apache Camel SSH component, and what is its default value if not explicitly specified?'
      answer: |
       'To configure whether to enable or disable all consumer-based health checks for the Apache Camel SSH component, you can modify the "healthCheckConsumerEnabled" option. This boolean property allows enabling or disabling all health checks originating from this component. Its default value is true, meaning that health checks are enabled if not explicitly specified otherwise.'
    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the Apache Camel SSH component option "healthCheckProducerEnabled" impact the health-check behavior of its producers, and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the Apache Camel SSH component option "healthCheckProducerEnabled" allows you to control whether all producer-based health checks are active for this component. By default, Camel has disabled such producer-based health checks. However, you can enable them globally by setting "camel.health.producersEnabled=true". The default value for the "healthCheckProducerEnabled" option is true, meaning that health checks are initially enabled in the SSH component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "certResource" option in the Apache Camel SSH component, how does it relate to resource-based certificate authentication, what type of value can be provided for this option, and is it required for use?'
      answer: |
       'The "certResource" option in the Apache Camel SSH component serves to set the path of the certificate resource to utilize for Authentication. This option relies on the ResourceHelperKeyPairProvider to resolve file-based certificates, making it suitable for resource-based certificate authentication. The type of value that can be provided for this option is a string representing the file path. It''s important to note that providing a value for "certResource" is optional; however, its usage is recommended within the security group of settings in your Camel configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the option ''certResourcePassword'' in the Apache Camel SSH component, and can it be left empty or does it require a default value? Also, how does this option relate to the security group within the component''s configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The ''certResourcePassword'' option in the Apache Camel SSH component is designed to set a password for loading an encrypted key (certResource), when certResource is an encrypted resource. While it does not have a default value, its use is optional as the password can be omitted if the key is not encrypted. This option pertains to the ''security'' group within the component''s configuration, indicating that it deals with sensitive security-related settings for managing encrypted resources during SSH communication.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, and group associated with the Apache Camel component "ssh" option named "ciphers", and is it required when configuring this component?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel SSH component''s "ciphers" option is used to specify a comma-separated list of allowed or supported ciphers in order of preference during an SSH connection. It does not have a default value. This configuration option falls under the "security" group, which means it pertains to security settings, and it''s optional as indicated by the "required: false".'
    - question: 'What are the possible key exchange algorithms that can be specified for the Apache Camel ssh component''s "kex" option, if it is configured, and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel ssh component''s "kex" option allows a comma-separated list of supported key exchange algorithms in their order of preference. However, there is no default value for this option. You must specify the preferred key exchange algorithms if you wish to configure them.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and optional nature of the "keyPairProvider" option in the Apache Camel ssh component, and what data type should be provided if a custom KeyPairProvider object is set for using certificates to connect to an SSH server?'
      answer: |
       'The "keyPairProvider" option within the Apache Camel SSH component is designed to allow you to specify a custom KeyPairProvider when connecting to an SSH server using certificates. This optional setting provides flexibility in managing your security credentials, particularly when dealing with complex Certificate Authority (CA) infrastructures or self-signed certificates. When setting a custom KeyPairProvider object, the data type should be an "object". However, please note that the default value for this option is null, meaning no custom provider is set if not explicitly provided.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the keyType option in the Apache Camel ssh component, and why did its behavior change from version 2.24.x to version 3.0.0/2.25.0 regarding the selection of KeyPair?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel SSH component, the ''keyType'' option sets the key type for authentication when using a KeyPairProvider. Prior to versions 3.0.0 and 2.25.0, by default, Camel enforced an ''ssh-rsa'' key type for authentication. However, since these versions, Camel will automatically select the first available KeyPair that is loaded instead of enforcing a specific key type as the default. This change allows greater flexibility in handling different types of SSH keys.'
    - question: 'What are the possible comma-separated lists of allowed message authentication code (MAC) algorithms that can be specified for the "macs" option in an Apache Camel SSH component, when using it for data integrity protection, and is this configuration optional or mandatory?'
      answer: |
       'The "macs" option in the Apache Camel SSH component accepts a comma-separated list of allowed Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms for data integrity protection. The order of preference should be followed when specifying these algorithms. The MAC algorithms supported are optional, meaning you can choose to not specify them if desired, but their inclusion is recommended for enhanced security. The group associated with this configuration is "security".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "password" option within the Apache Camel''s SSH component, and is it required for use when setting up a connection to a remote SSH server? Additionally, can you explain how this option interacts with the "keyPairProvider" setting?'
      answer: |
       'The "password" option within Apache Camel''s SSH component is designed to set the password that will be used when connecting to a remote SSH server. However, it''s important to note that this option requires the "keyPairProvider" setting to be set to null, meaning that you should not provide any SSH key pair for authentication if you choose to use this option. The default value of the "password" option is null, meaning no password is set by default. Regarding its interaction with the "keyPairProvider", when using the "password" option, you should explicitly set "keyPairProvider" to null to indicate that you will be using a password for authentication rather than an SSH key pair.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "signatures" option in the Apache Camel ssh component, and is it required or optional? Also, can you explain where this option fits within the context of security in using the ssh component?'
      answer: |
       'The "signatures" option in the Apache Camel SSH component is an optional setting that specifies a comma-separated list of allowed or supported signature algorithms in their order of preference. This option influences how data integrity and authenticity are verified during SSH sessions. By default, it has no predefined value (null). The placement of this option within the context of security in using the ssh component is crucial as it helps establish secure communication channels by ensuring the correctness and authenticity of transmitted data.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "username" option in the Apache Camel "ssh" component, and is it a required setting?'
      answer: |
       'The "username" option in the Apache Camel "ssh" component is designed to set the username used for logging into the remote SSH server. By default, it does not have a value assigned ("defaultValue": null). This means that if no specific username is provided, the default system username will be used. The requirement for providing this option is optional as indicated by "required": false. It falls under the "security" group of settings in Camel''s SSH component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the Apache Camel SSH component''s option "failOnUnknownHost" when the property "knownHosts" is not set, and is it required to be set for this option to function?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the Apache Camel SSH component''s option "failOnUnknownHost" is false, meaning a connection to an unknown host will not fail by default when the property "knownHosts" is not set. However, it''s important to note that this option only functions if the property "knownHosts" is explicitly set in your configuration, although its use is optional.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "knownHostsResource" option in the Apache Camel SSH component, and is it required when using this component? Also, where does this option set the path for a known_hosts file?'
      answer: |
       'The "knownHostsResource" option in the Apache Camel SSH component is designed to set the resource path for a known_hosts file. This file contains information about the host keys of machines you have previously connected to, which helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. By default, this value is not set, meaning it takes its default value of null. Its usage is optional in the component, and when provided, it sets the path for a known_hosts file within your application context.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the Apache Camel `timeout` option in the `ssh` component, and can it be specified as a required configuration? Also, what unit of measurement (milliseconds, seconds, etc.) is used for this timeout setting?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel `timeout` option within the `ssh` component defaults to 30000 milliseconds (or 30 seconds) as an integer value. It can be specified as an optional configuration, meaning it''s not required to set a timeout when using this option. The unit of measurement for this setting is milliseconds.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "pollCommand" option in the Apache Camel ssh component when using it as a consumer (from(ssh://...)), and how should the command string be formatted if it needs to include a newline character?'
      answer: |
       'The "pollCommand" option in the Apache Camel ssh component, when used as a consumer (from(ssh://...)), sets the command string to send to the remote SSH server during each poll cycle. This is useful if you want to execute specific commands periodically on the remote server.              The command string should be formatted in such a way that it includes any necessary arguments and options, and may require the inclusion of a newline character (represented as %0A when URL encoded). This newline character should be added to the command where needed to separate multiple commands or parameters, as line breaks are significant in Unix-like systems. For example: "command1; command2" becomes "command1%0ACMD2".'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel SSH component, and under what circumstances can it be useful to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel SSH component is a boolean parameter with a default value of false. This option, when enabled, allows the polling consumer to send an empty message (no body) if it did not find any files to process during its idle period. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to maintain a consistent heartbeat or indicate that the consumer is active even when there are no files to process at the moment.'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel ssh component''s bridgeErrorHandler option handle exceptions when trying to pick up incoming messages, and under what conditions is it possible for this option to be utilized?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel ssh component''s "bridgeErrorHandler" option allows handling of exceptions that occur while trying to pick up incoming messages, by bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions will now be processed as a message and managed by the routing Error Handler. However, this functionality is only possible if the 3rd party component allows Camel to be notified of an exception being thrown. Some components manage exceptions internally, making bridgeErrorHandler inapplicable. In cases where the component can be extended to interface with the 3rd party component, it may become feasible for future releases. By default, the consumer will utilize the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, which will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored if bridgeErrorHandler is not enabled.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the exceptionHandler option in the Apache Camel SSH component, when it is used in conjunction with the bridgeErrorHandler, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The `exceptionHandler` option in the Apache Camel SSH component is designed to allow consumers to use a custom ExceptionHandler. However, if the `bridgeErrorHandler` option is enabled, the `exceptionHandler` will not be in effect. By default, the consumer handles exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. When used independently, the `exceptionHandler` provides an opportunity for advanced consumers to manage errors according to their specific requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and possible values for the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel SSH component when configuring the consumer, and why might this option be considered an advanced setting?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel SSH component, when configuring the consumer, is null, meaning it does not have a predefined value. When set, this option determines the message exchange pattern between the producer and the consumer. Since it allows fine-grained control over how messages are exchanged, it might be considered an advanced setting as it requires a deeper understanding of messaging patterns and their implications on the data flow within a Camel route. The "consumer (advanced)" group tag also suggests that this option is intended for more experienced users.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel SSH component, and what is its purpose when providing a custom implementation?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel SSH component is null. Its purpose is to provide you with an opportunity to offer your custom implementation of the `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy`. This strategy allows you to control error handling that typically occurs during the poll operation before an Exchange has been created and routed in Camel, offering more advanced and specific error handling for your use case.'
    - question: 'Here''s a clear and concise question based on the provided information:              "What is the purpose of the ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Apache Camel SSH component, and when should it be set to true?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Apache Camel SSH component allows you to defer the startup of a producer until the first message is processed. This can be useful in situations where starting the producer might cause the route to fail during startup, which could prevent the CamelContext and routes from being started altogether. By setting ''lazyStartProducer'' to true, you can handle such startup failures using Camel''s routing error handlers instead. However, please note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some additional time, thereby prolonging the overall processing time of the process.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible alternative values for the Apache Camel SSH component option "channelType" when specifying command execution, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel SSH component''s "channelType" option when specifying command execution is "exec". However, you can provide an alternative value if needed, as it is not mandatory to do so. This option sets the channel type that will be passed during command execution, and it falls under the advanced group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the Apache Camel ssh component''s option "clientBuilder", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel SSH component''s option "clientBuilder" is an instance of `ClientBuilder` used by either the producer or consumer to create a new `SshClient`. It does not have a default value, meaning you need to provide your own implementation if you wish to use it. This option falls under the advanced category of usage for the SSH component.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel SSH component to enable or disable data compression when transferring files over SSH, and what options are available for specifying the type of compression?'
      answer: |
       'To configure data compression for the Apache Camel SSH component when transferring files over SSH, you can set the "compressions" option under the "advanced" group. This option determines whether to use compression and if so, the type of compression. The default value is null, meaning no compression is used by default. However, you can specify the type of compression by setting it to a string value such as "zlib", indicating that zlib compression will be utilized during data transfer. If you wish to disable compression, simply do not set this option or explicitly set it to an empty string.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel SSH component''s ''shellPrompt'' option, and is it mandatory to set a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel SSH component''s ''shellPrompt'' option is an advanced setting that allows you to control the shell prompt. By default, this option has no value (null). This means that the shell prompt will not be dropped when a response is read after command execution. However, it is not mandatory to set a value for this option as the behavior can proceed without it if unspecified.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the Apache Camel component ssh option named "sleepForShellPrompt", and can it be configured as a required option? (Answer: The default value is 100 milliseconds, and it is an integer. It can be configured as a non-required option.)'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the SSH component''s "sleepForShellPrompt" option in Apache Camel is an integer of 100 milliseconds. This option can be set to any positive integer, but it is not mandatory or required for configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the Apache Camel component "ssh" option called "backoffErrorThreshold", and can it be configured if not set by default? If so, what type of data should be provided for this configuration, and under which group does this configuration option reside in the scheduler?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel SSH component''s "backoffErrorThreshold" option determines the number of consecutive error polls that occur before the "backoffMultiplier" should be applied. By default, it has no specified value, meaning it can take any integer value when configured. If you wish to set a custom value for this option, provide an integer as the configuration data. This configuration option resides under the "scheduler" group in the Camel context or configuration file.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the Apache Camel SSH component option "backoffIdleThreshold", and is it a required configuration setting? Also, could you explain in what group this option belongs to within the scheduler settings?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffIdleThreshold" option for the Apache Camel SSH component is an integer value that specifies the number of subsequent idle polls before the backoffMultiplier should be applied. This setting helps manage the frequency of attempts when there''s no activity during an SSH session, ensuring a graceful backoff strategy. The default value for this option is null, meaning it doesn''t have a preset value and can be set according to your application''s needs. It''s important to note that this configuration setting is not required, as denoted by the "required": false. Lastly, this option falls under the "scheduler" group within the Camel component settings, indicating it''s related to the scheduling and management of tasks or actions in your application.'
    - question: 'Given the documentation provided, here''s a question that can be answered with the information:              "What is the purpose of the ''backoffMultiplier'' option in the Apache Camel SSH component within the context of the scheduled polling consumer? Also, could you explain when this option should be configured alongside backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold?"'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s SSH component, the ''backoffMultiplier'' option is designed to facilitate a backoff strategy for the scheduled polling consumer when there have been multiple consecutive idle or error events. When set, it specifies the number of skipped polls before another attempt is made again after an idle or error event.              The ''backoffMultiplier'' should be configured in conjunction with either the ''backoffIdleThreshold'' or ''backoffErrorThreshold'' (or both) to define the conditions under which a backoff should occur. ''backoffIdleThreshold'' specifies the number of idle milliseconds before a backoff is triggered, while ''backoffErrorThreshold'' indicates the maximum number of errors that can occur before triggering a backoff. This combined setup allows for adaptive behavior in situations where transient issues may cause multiple consecutive idle or error events.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the millisecond delay between SSH polling operations using the Apache Camel component, if I want to set a custom delay instead of the default value (500ms)?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the millisecond delay between SSH polling operations using the Apache Camel component, you can modify the "delay" option for the SSH component in your route configuration. If you wish to set a custom delay instead of the default value (500ms), you would assign an integer representing your desired delay to this option. Here is an example:              ```       from("ssh://user@example.com?delay=1000") // replace with your own SSH details and desired delay in milliseconds       ```              In the given example, the delay between SSH polling operations would be set to 1000ms (1 second). Keep in mind that this option is optional and only applicable under the "scheduler" groups. So make sure it''s included when defining your SSH component in the route configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the effect of enabling the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel ssh component when using a ScheduledPollConsumer, and what is its default value? Is it mandatory to set this option when configuring the ssh component?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel SSH component, when used with a ScheduledPollConsumer, allows the consumer to run immediately again if the previous run polled one or more messages. This means that it can continuously process new messages as they arrive, without waiting for the scheduled interval. However, this behavior is not mandatory; the default value of "greedy" is false, meaning it will behave normally, following the scheduled polling interval. The "greedy" option belongs to the scheduler group of configuration options in Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the ''initialDelay'' option in the Apache Camel SSH component, and is it a required configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The ''initialDelay'' option in the Apache Camel SSH component has a default value of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) and its data type is integer. It is not a required configuration, meaning you can choose to provide a different value or accept the default if desired, under the "scheduler" group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the Apache Camel component ssh option named "repeatCount", and what happens when this option is set to a value less than 1, equal to 1, greater than 1, or to zero or negative numbers?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel SSH component''s "repeatCount" option specifies a maximum limit for the number of times an operation can be repeated. By default, it is set to 0, indicating that the operation will fire indefinitely.              When you set "repeatCount" to a positive integer value less than 1 (e.g., 0.5), the scheduler will still consider it as 1 and only execute the operation once. If you set it to exactly 1, the operation will be executed only once. For values greater than 1, the operation will be repeated that exact number of times.              Lastly, when you set "repeatCount" to zero or negative numbers, it means the operation will continue firing indefinitely (forever).'
    - question: 'What is the default logging level for the start/complete log lines produced by the SSH component''s consumer in Apache Camel when no specific logging level is specified, and what options are available to configure this logging level?'
      answer: |
       'The default logging level for the start/complete log lines produced by the SSH component''s consumer in Apache Camel is TRACE, meaning that detailed debugging information will be logged when no specific logging level is specified. You can configure this logging level using the "runLoggingLevel" option within the "component": "ssh" setting. This option allows you to adjust the logging level according to your requirements, with available levels ranging from OFF (no logs) to ALL (most detailed logs).'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom or shared thread pool using the scheduledExecutorService option in Apache Camel''s SSH component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom or shared thread pool using the `scheduledExecutorService` option in Apache Camel''s SSH component, you can specify an instance of ExecutorService or its subtypes (such as ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor) within your route configuration. This option allows for setting up a multi-threaded environment for the consumer, improving performance if multiple tasks need to be executed concurrently. However, it is not mandatory to provide a value for this option, as each consumer will use its own single threaded thread pool by default.'
    - question: 'How can I set up the Apache Camel SSH component to use a cron scheduler, and what are the available built-in schedulers for this purpose (from either camel-spring or camel-quartz)? Is there a default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'To set up the Apache Camel SSH component with a cron scheduler, you can use either the camel-spring or camel-quartz components. Both of these components provide built-in cron schedulers. By setting the "scheduler" option to "spring" or "quartz", you can choose between these two schedulers. There is no default value for this option, so you need to explicitly specify either "spring" or "quartz" when configuring your component.'
    - question: 'In Apache Camel''s SSH component, what is the purpose and default value of the option named "schedulerProperties", and are these properties required when using the SSH component?'
      answer: |
       'The option "schedulerProperties" in Apache Camel''s SSH component serves to configure additional properties when you''re utilizing a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz, Spring-based schedulers. However, it is important to note that the use of these properties is not required and the default value for "schedulerProperties" is null.'
    - question: '"What is the default behavior and if it can be manually configured for the ''startScheduler'' option in the Apache Camel ssh component, regarding whether the scheduler should be automatically started or not?"'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the ''startScheduler'' option in the Apache Camel SSH component is to auto-start the scheduler (i.e., it is set to true by default). However, if you prefer to manually configure this setting, you can do so as it is not mandatory and accepts boolean values.'
    - question: 'What is the default time unit for the `initialDelay` and `delay` options in the Apache Camel SSH component when using its scheduler feature, and are there other possible time units that can be specified if desired?'
      answer: |
       'The default time unit for the `initialDelay` and `delay` options in the Apache Camel SSH component''s scheduler feature is MILLISECONDS. However, if you wish to specify a different time unit, other possible units include SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS, or DAYS.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel ssh component, and can it be configured to use a fixed rate instead if desired?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel SSH component is set to true, meaning that a fixed delay is used. However, if you wish to configure it to use a fixed rate instead, you can do so as this option accepts boolean values. For more details on how to implement this using ScheduledExecutorService in JDK, please refer to the provided description and relevant documentation.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "certResource" option in the Apache Camel SSH component, and under what conditions is it required or optional to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "certResource" option in the Apache Camel SSH component sets the path of the certificate to use for authentication. It utilizes the ResourceHelperKeyPairProvider to resolve file-based certificates, but its usage depends on the setting of keyType. By default, it does not have a value. Providing a value for this option is optional, though it''s required if you want to specifically specify the location of your certificate file within the context of using the SSH component for authentication purposes, falling under the "security" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "certResourcePassword" option within the Apache Camel SSH component, and is it mandatory or optional to provide a value for this option? Also, what type of data can be provided as a value if specified?'
      answer: |
       'The "certResourcePassword" option in the Apache Camel SSH component is designed to set the password needed for decryption when using an encrypted key (certResource) within the SSH component. This option is not mandatory, meaning it can be provided or left unset based on whether you are using an encrypted key as part of your SSH operations. When specified, the value for this option should be a string representing the password needed to decrypt the encrypted key. This option falls under the "security" group of options within the Apache Camel framework.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, type, required status, and groups associated with the Apache Camel SSH component''s "ciphers" option, and can it be omitted if not provided? (Answer: The purpose of the ''ciphers'' option in the SSH component of Apache Camel is to specify a comma-separated list of allowed or supported ciphers in their order of preference. Its default value is null, type is string, it is not required, and it falls under the ''security'' groups.)'
      answer: |
       'The ''ciphers'' option in the Apache Camel SSH component is used to specify a comma-separated list of allowed or supported ciphers in their order of preference. Its default value is null, type is string, it is not required, and it falls under the ''security'' groups. Therefore, it can be omitted if not provided.'
    - question: 'What are the possible values for the Apache Camel SSH component option "kex" when it comes to specifying a comma-separated list of supported key exchange algorithms in their order of preference, and is it required to provide such a value if not set explicitly?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel SSH component''s "kex" option, under the security group, allows you to specify a comma-separated list of supported key exchange algorithms in their order of preference. Although there is no default value provided for this option, it is not mandatory to set it explicitly as the component may still use its own predefined list of allowed algorithms if left unspecified.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel component ssh option named ''keyPairProvider'', and is it optional or required, considering its group belongs to the ''security'' category?'
      answer: |
       'The ''keyPairProvider'' option within the Apache Camel SSH component is designed to set a reference for the KeyPairProvider when connecting to an SSH server using certificates. This option allows you to manage your certificate-based connections securely. Its default value is null, meaning no default KeyPairProvider is assigned if not provided explicitly. The ''keyPairProvider'' option is optional, not required, and belongs to the ''security'' group of options, signifying its importance in maintaining the security of your SSH connections.'
    - question: 'What is the default key type used for authentication when using the Apache Camel SSH component if no specific key type is set, and why did this behavior change from prior to Camel version 3.0.0 / 2.25.0?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel SSH component, if no specific key type is set for authentication, it will use the first available KeyPair loaded by default as of Camel versions 3.0.0 and 2.25.0. This change from enforcing a default key type of ''ssh-rsa'' in prior versions was made to provide flexibility and support for multiple key types.'
    - question: 'What are the possible values and their order of preference for the option "macs" in the Apache Camel SSH component, when it comes to setting message authentication code algorithms for data integrity protection? Is there a default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The option "macs" in the Apache Camel SSH component allows you to set a comma-separated list of allowed or supported Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms in their order of preference. These algorithms are used for data integrity protection. There is no default value for this option, allowing you to specify the MAC algorithm(s) that best suit your requirements. Examples of MAC algorithms commonly supported include HmacMD5, HmacSHA1, and HmacSHA256. The exact list will depend on the SSH server implementation in use.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel ssh component''s "password" option, and is it required for using this option, according to the provided information?'
      answer: |
       'The "password" option within the Apache Camel SSH component serves to specify the password to be used when connecting to a remote SSH server. However, as stated in the provided information, the use of this password option is not mandatory; it''s optional with the default value being null. This means you can provide your desired password when configuring your connection, but if you don''t, Camel will not require one. Keep in mind that for this option to be used, the "keyPairProvider" must be set to null, indicating a password-based connection as opposed to a key-based one. This detail falls under the security group of settings within Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "signatures" option in the Apache Camel SSH component, and is it optional or required? Also, can you explain where this option fits within the security group of options for this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "signatures" option in the Apache Camel SSH component is designed to specify a comma-separated list of preferred signature algorithms during an SSH connection, ordered from highest to lowest preference. By default, it has no predefined value (defaultValue: null), meaning that the client will use whatever algorithm is negotiated by default with the server. The "signatures" option is optional and can be found within the security group of options for this component, indicating its relevance to the overall security configuration during an SSH connection.'
