    - question: 'What is the optional string parameter, `applicationName`, in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", and what value does it represent if provided, as described in its documentation?'
      answer: |
       'The `applicationName` parameter, which is an optional string in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", represents the name of the Google Sheets application. If provided, this value should be a string in camel-case format, such as `camel-google-sheets/1.0`. However, it''s important to note that this parameter is not required for the functionality of the component.'
    - question: 'How does the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" differ from the default exception handling method, and under what conditions can it be configured to bridge exceptions to the Camel routing Error Handler?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel "google-sheets-stream" component allows for bridging exceptions that occur while the component is trying to pickup incoming messages, to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions will be treated as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler. However, this is only possible if the third-party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. If the component handles exceptions internally, then bridgeErrorHandler cannot be configured. In cases where the component can hook into the third-party component, this feature may be improved for future releases. By default, the consumer uses the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, which logs them at WARN or ERROR level and ignores them.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientId" option in the Apache Camel''s "google-sheets-stream" component, and is it marked as required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option in Apache Camel''s "google-sheets-stream" component is designated for providing the Client ID of your Google Sheets application. By default, it does not have a value assigned ("defaultValue": null). This option is optional as it is marked as "required": false. The grouping of this option falls under "consumer".'
    - question: 'What is the configuration required to utilize a shared configuration when using the Google Sheets Stream component in Apache Camel, and is it optional or mandatory to provide this configuration?'
      answer: |
       'To utilize a shared configuration when working with the Google Sheets Stream component in Apache Camel, you need to provide an object-type configuration that specifies the details of the shared setup. This step is optional as indicated by the "required": false property. If you choose to use it, the configuration will help make your component interact seamlessly with a shared Google Sheets resource.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel''s Google Sheets Stream component, when it comes to using a wide-domain service account, and is this option required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "delegate" option in Apache Camel''s Google Sheets Stream component, when used with a wide-domain service account, serves as a delegate for accessing the Google Sheets. This option is of type string, but it doesn''t have a default value. Its usage is optional, meaning you can provide or skip it during configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and required status of the ''includeGridData'' option in the Apache Camel ''google-sheets-stream'' component, and under what category of options can it be found if a user wishes to include grid data when consuming data from Google Sheets?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the ''includeGridData'' option in the Apache Camel ''google-sheets-stream'' component is false, and it can be found under the ''consumer'' category of options. If a user wishes to include grid data when consuming data from Google Sheets, they should set this option to true.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "majorDimension" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "majorDimension" option in the "google-sheets-stream" Apache Camel component is "ROWS". It has a string data type, and while not required, setting this option allows you to specify the major dimension that results should use.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the "maxResults" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-sheets-stream", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "maxResults" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-sheets-stream" is null, meaning there is no predefined limit on the number of returned results. This option, although not required, allows you to specify an integer that will set a maximum number of rows in a returned value range dataset or the number of returned value ranges in a batch request.'
    - question: 'How do you specify a specific range of cells within a Google Sheet when using the "google-sheets-stream" component in Apache Camel, and is it optional to provide this information?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the "google-sheets-stream" component in Apache Camel, specifying a specific range of cells within a Google Sheet can be done by setting the option as "range". This option takes a string value that describes the range of rows and columns to get data from. For instance, "A1:B5" refers to row 1, column A through row 5, column B. However, it is not mandatory to provide this information as the default value for the "range" option is null, meaning the entire sheet will be read if no specific range is specified.'
    - question: 'What are the different scopes that can be specified when using the "scopes" option in the Apache Camel''s google-sheets-stream component, and what is their role in determining the level of permissions for a Google Sheets application?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s google-sheets-stream component, the "scopes" option specifies the level of permissions you want a Google Sheets application to have when accessing user accounts. These scopes define the data or functionality that your application can access. For detailed information about available Google Scopes, you may refer to the Google Developers documentation at this link: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes              The choice of scopes plays a crucial role in determining the level of permissions for your Google Sheets application. For example, if you choose the "spreadsheets" scope, your application will be able to read, write, and manage Google Spreadsheets on behalf of the user account. However, if you only specify the "openid" scope, your application can only identify and authenticate users using OpenID Connect but not access their Google Sheets data. The array of scopes that can be specified in this context allows for flexible permission management depending on the specific requirements of your application.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" to process each row or column of a Google Sheets value range individually, instead of using the entire value range object as an exchange in batch processing? In other words, how do I enable the option called "splitResults" for this component?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" to process each row or column of a Google Sheets value range individually, you need to set the "splitResults" option to true. This can be done by setting the following property in your route configuration:              ```       googleSheetsStream().options(StreamOptions.streamedContent(true).splitResults(true));       ```              With this setting, each row or column will be represented with a separate exchange in batch processing. If you don''t set this option, the value range object will be used as an exchange junk size in the default batch processing.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the `valueRenderOption` option within the Apache Camel''s Google Sheets Stream component, and can it be considered as a mandatory configuration parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The `valueRenderOption` option within Apache Camel''s Google Sheets Stream component determines how values should be rendered in the output. Its default value is FORMATTED_VALUE, meaning that the values are rendered in their original format as they appear in the Google Sheet. This option is not mandatory as it can be set to false or other string values if desired, but its use may depend on your specific use case for handling and rendering values appropriately in the output stream.'
    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" impact the configuration of this component, and what is its default value and group, if it has one?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" allows for automatic configuration of this component through autowiring. When enabled, the component will search the registry to find a single instance of matching type, which is then configured on the component. This can be beneficial for automatically configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc., within your application. It''s important to note that disabling this option means you will have to manually configure these components. The default value of "autowiredEnabled" is true, and it falls under the advanced group of configuration options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientFactory" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-sheets-stream", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientFactory" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-sheets-stream" serves as a factory for creating the GoogleSheetsClient, defaulting to use the BatchGoogleSheetsClientFactory. This configuration is optional and falls under the advanced group of settings, meaning it''s not required when using this component to interact with Google Sheets.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `healthCheckConsumerEnabled` option in the Apache Camel `google-sheets-stream` component to `false` affect the behavior of consumer-based health checks for this particular component?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `healthCheckConsumerEnabled` option in the Apache Camel `google-sheets-stream` component to `false` disables all consumer-based health checks for this component. This means that the system will no longer perform automatic health checks on the consumers of this Google Sheets stream, and you may need to manually monitor their status when integrating with other systems or applications.'
    - question: 'How does one configure the Apache Camel "google-sheets-stream" component to disable all producer-based health checks from this component specifically, and how does this differ from enabling producer checks globally for all components in Camel?'
      answer: |
       'To disable all producer-based health checks specifically for the "google-sheets-stream" component in Apache Camel, you can set the option "healthCheckProducerEnabled" to false within your configuration. However, this setting only affects the specified component.              On the other hand, if you want to enable producer checks globally for all components in Camel, you need to set the property "camel.health.producersEnabled=true". This global setting overrides any specific settings per component and applies to every component used in your Camel application.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", and why is it recommended to use a different option like "refreshToken" for long-term usage?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" is an OAuth 2 access token used to authenticate your application when interacting with Google Sheets. However, it''s important to note that this token typically expires after an hour. To ensure continuous and uninterrupted access for longer periods, it''s recommended to utilize the "refreshToken" option instead. The refresh token grants you a new access token once the current one has expired. This practice is particularly useful in scenarios requiring long-term usage of the Google Sheets API.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", and is it required?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" serves as the client secret of the Google Sheets application. It is a string value that plays a crucial role in securing your data by verifying the identity of the application requesting access to Google Sheets. By default, it has no preset value ("defaultValue": null), meaning you''ll need to provide your own client secret during configuration. However, whether or not this option is required depends on the specific use case and authentication requirements; the "required" attribute for this option is set to false in this context. It falls under the "security" group of options due to its role in maintaining data integrity and security.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the `google-sheets-stream` Apache Camel component to automatically obtain a new access token when the current one expires, in case the application is long-lived? To do this, should I set a value for the `refreshToken` option within the component''s configuration? If yes, what data type and format should be provided for it?'
      answer: |
       'Yes, to configure the `google-sheets-stream` Apache Camel component to automatically obtain a new access token when the current one expires, you should set a value for the `refreshToken` option within the component''s configuration. The data type for this option is a string, and it represents the OAuth 2 refresh token that Google Sheets will use to obtain a new access token whenever necessary in long-lived applications. However, it is not required to set this value if you don''t have a refresh token yet; you can always provide it later when available. Group: security.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and description of the "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel component called "google-sheets-stream", and is it required when using this component? Also, what type of data should be provided for this option if specified?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-sheets-stream" serves to set a .json file containing credentials for a Google Service account. Its purpose is to provide authentication when interacting with Google Sheets. It''s not strictly required, but specifying it allows your application to access Google Sheets without user intervention. When using this option, you should provide a valid path or URL pointing to the .json file that contains your Service account credentials if specified under the "security" group in your Camel configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the optional string parameter `applicationName` in the Apache Camel `google-sheets-stream` component used for, and what is its default value if not provided?'
      answer: |
       'The optional string parameter `applicationName` in the Apache Camel `google-sheets-stream` component is used to specify the name of the Google Sheets application. If not provided, it does not have a default value.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-sheets-stream"? Also, is it required when using this component, and if not, can you specify its data type?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-sheets-stream" serves as the Client ID of the Google Sheets application. It''s a string data type, and it does not have a default value (defaultValue: null). Its usage is optional within the consumer group. If not provided, you may need to set up your integration with a different method or use a previously authenticated client.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" is a string type, optional setting that allows you to delegate for a wide-domain service account. This means that you can use it to authenticate as a different user when interacting with Google Sheets. By default, this option has no predefined value (defaultValue: null). Therefore, its usage is not required when working with the "google-sheets-stream" component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "includeGridData" option in the Apache Camel''s google-sheets-stream component, what is its default value, and is it mandatory to use this option when configuring a consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The "includeGridData" option in Apache Camel''s google-sheets-stream component determines whether grid data should be included in the returned results. Its default value is false, meaning that grid data will not be returned by default. Using this option is not mandatory when configuring a consumer; it can be set to true if you specifically need the grid data in your use case.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "majorDimension" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-sheets-stream", and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "majorDimension" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-sheets-stream" is ROWS. Providing a value for this option is not mandatory.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the "maxResults" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", and can it be considered as a required configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "maxResults" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" is null, meaning there is no predefined limit on the number of results returned. It''s an integer type, but it can be configured if desired, and its use is not mandatory (i.e., it''s considered optional).'
    - question: 'What is the syntax for specifying the range of cells to retrieve data from a Google Sheet using the range option of the Apache Camel google-sheets-stream component, and is it required to provide a value if not set by default?'
      answer: |
       'The syntax for specifying the range of cells to retrieve data from a Google Sheet using the range option of the Apache Camel google-sheets-stream component is a string format. While it''s not required, you can provide a value if you wish to define specific rows and columns to get data from. If no value is set, the default is null.'
    - question: 'What are the default and possible values for the "scopes" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", and is it required when using this component? Moreover, where can I find more information about the different levels of permissions that can be specified with this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "scopes" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" does not have a default value and it is not required when using this component. However, you can specify the level of permissions you want an application to have to a user account. To learn more about the different levels of permissions that can be specified with this option, please refer to the Google Scopes documentation available at https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes. This resource provides detailed information on the various scopes and their associated permissions that are available for integrating with Google Sheets using this component.'
    - question: 'In relation to the Apache Camel "google-sheets-stream" component, when should I consider enabling the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the consumer''s polling configuration? And what is the default value of this option and is it required?'
      answer: |
       'In relation to the Apache Camel "google-sheets-stream" component, you should consider enabling the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the consumer''s polling configuration when you want the polling consumer to send an empty message (no body) if it did not poll any files during its idle period. This option is particularly useful when you want to ensure that the consumer sends a message, even if no new data is available, to maintain the expected message flow or for monitoring purposes. The default value of this option is false, and it is not required, meaning you can choose to use it or leave it unset based on your specific requirements in the consumer group.'
    - question: 'Given the information provided, here''s a question that can be answered using it:              "What does the ''splitResults'' option do in the Apache Camel component ''google-sheets-stream'', and under what conditions will it process each row or column of a value range object individually in batch processing?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''splitResults'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-sheets-stream'' determines whether the value range result should be split into individual rows or columns for processing during batch processing. When ''splitResults'' is set to true, each row or column within the value range object will be represented as a separate exchange in the batch process. If ''splitResults'' is false, the entire value range object is used as an exchange and its size will not be split up.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the ''valueRenderOption'' option in the Apache Camel''s ''google-sheets-stream'' component, and under which group (if any) is it considered optional?'
      answer: |
       'The ''valueRenderOption'' option in Apache Camel''s ''google-sheets-stream'' component determines how values should be rendered in the output. Its default value is FORMATTED_VALUE, meaning that the values will be presented in a formatted manner as they appear in the Google Sheet. This option is considered optional and falls under the consumer group, which refers to options related to handling and processing data from external sources like Google Sheets.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel component for google-sheets-stream allow exceptions to be handled by the routing Error Handler, and what are the implications if this option is not enabled?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel component for google-sheets-stream allows exceptions that may occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages from Google Sheets to be handled by the routing Error Handler. This is beneficial because it enables a more structured and manageable way of dealing with such exceptions, rather than logging them at WARN or ERROR level and ignoring them as is the default behavior.              However, it''s important to note that this feature is only possible if the third-party component (in this case, Google Sheets) allows Camel to be notified of any exceptions thrown. If the component handles exceptions internally without providing a means for Camel to intercept them, then enabling `bridgeErrorHandler` will not be possible. In such cases, future releases might improve the Camel component to work with the third-party component more closely and make this feature available.              If the `bridgeErrorHandler` option is not enabled, exceptions will still occur but they will not be processed as messages or handled by the routing Error Handler. Instead, they will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored, which might lead to unhandled errors and potential issues in your application.'
    - question: 'How can I customize the exception handling for errors that occur during Google Sheets Stream operations in Apache Camel using a custom ExceptionHandler? Is it necessary to disable the bridgeErrorHandler option if I want to use my custom ExceptionHandler, and what is the default behavior when no custom ExceptionHandler is specified?'
      answer: |
       'To customize exception handling for errors that occur during Google Sheets Stream operations in Apache Camel, you can implement a custom ExceptionHandler by configuring the "exceptionHandler" option under the "google-sheets-stream" component. If the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled, then your custom ExceptionHandler will not be used, as the consumer handles exceptions by default for logging and ignoring those at WARN or ERROR level. However, if you wish to use your custom ExceptionHandler, it''s not necessary to disable the "bridgeErrorHandler" option explicitly. By default, when no custom ExceptionHandler is specified, Apache Camel will handle errors according to its default behavior.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", and is it mandatory to set a value for this option when using the consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" does not have a default value, meaning you can choose whether or not to set a value based on your specific use case. This option sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange, and it falls under the advanced group of options called "consumer (advanced)". If you decide not to specify an exchange pattern, Camel will automatically select an appropriate one for your interaction with Google Sheets Stream.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets Stream component, and what kind of custom implementation can be provided for it to control error handling during poll operations?'
      answer: |
       'The `pollStrategy` option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets Stream component allows you to supply a custom implementation of `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy`. This feature enables you to manage error handling that typically arises during the poll operation before an Exchange is created and routed within Camel. By providing your own implementation, you can control how errors are handled during the polling process for this specific component.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel google-sheets-stream component, and can it be set to a specific integer value if not required?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets Stream component is an optional setting that defines the number of subsequent error polls (failed due to some error) before the backoffMultiplier should kick-in. If not specified, it has no default value, meaning you can set it to a specific integer value if needed within your scheduler group configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value, if any, of the "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", and is it a required configuration parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" is an integer value that specifies the number of consecutive idle polls (i.e., polls where no data is returned) before a backoff multiplier should be applied. This means if your application doesn''t receive any new data after a certain number of requests, it will automatically slow down its rate of polling to avoid overloading the Google Sheets API. By default, there is no predefined value for this option as you can configure it based on your specific use case requirements. It''s not a required configuration parameter, meaning you can choose whether or not to set it according to your application needs, under the "scheduler" group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" option named "backoffMultiplier", and how does it work in conjunction with the options "backoffIdleThreshold" and "backoffErrorThreshold"? Additionally, what is the default value for this option and under which group setting can it be found?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" option named "backoffMultiplier" serves to control the backoff mechanism when there have been a number of subsequent idles or errors in consecutive polls. This multiplier defines the number of skipped polls before the next attempt is made again, helping to prevent excessive retries that could overwhelm Google Sheets API.              When using "backoffMultiplier", it''s essential to configure both "backoffIdleThreshold" and/or "backoffErrorThreshold". The former sets the number of idle seconds (without receiving any data) before backoff starts, while the latter defines the number of error responses received before backoff occurs.              The default value for the "backoffMultiplier" option is null, meaning that no automatic backoff mechanism will be in place unless explicitly configured by the user. This setting can be found under the "scheduler" group within the configuration options for the "google-sheets-stream" component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delay" option in the Apache Camel''s "google-sheets-stream" component when it comes to its usage within the scheduler group, if not explicitly specified?'
      answer: |
       'The "delay" option in the Apache Camel''s "google-sheets-stream" component, when used within the scheduler group, serves to specify (in milliseconds) the duration before the next poll for data retrieval from Google Sheets. If not explicitly specified, the default value is set at 500 milliseconds, meaning that the component will wait half a second before making another request.'
    - question: 'What is the behavior of the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" when the option "greedy" is set to true in its ScheduledPollConsumer, and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'When you set the option "greedy" to true in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" within its ScheduledPollConsumer, it means that if the previous run polled one or more messages, the consumer will immediately run again, without waiting for the scheduled interval. The default value for this option is false, indicating that the consumer will follow the scheduled interval regardless of the number of messages retrieved in the previous run.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the optional configuration parameter "initialDelay" in the Apache Camel component named "google-sheets-stream", which is part of the scheduler group?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional configuration parameter "initialDelay" in the "google-sheets-stream" Apache Camel component, belonging to the scheduler group, is an integer type with a default value of 1000 milliseconds (ms).'
    - question: 'What is the maximum number of times a Google Sheets stream processor using Apache Camel will execute if the "repeatCount" option is set to 5?'
      answer: |
       'If you set the "repeatCount" option for the Google Sheets stream processor in Apache Camel to 5, it means that the processor will only execute a maximum of five times. This feature serves as a limit for the number of times the scheduler will fire. However, if you set the value to zero or negative, the processor will execute indefinitely (or "fire forever").'
    - question: 'What is the default logging level for the "start/complete" log lines generated by the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" when it polls, and in what scenarios can we configure a custom logging level for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The default logging level for the "start/complete" log lines generated by the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" when it polls is TRACE. However, you can configure a custom logging level for this option if desired. This configuration falls under the "scheduler" group of settings.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom or shared thread pool for the consumer of the Apache Camel Google Sheets Stream component using the scheduledExecutorService option? Is it necessary to provide a value for this option, and if so, what type of object should this be in the context of Camel''s scheduler group?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom or shared thread pool for the consumer of the Apache Camel Google Sheets Stream component using the `scheduledExecutorService` option, you can set up an `object` that represents a `ThreadPoolExecutor`. This is not a required setting by default as each consumer has its own single-threaded thread pool. However, if you wish to customize it, you should provide this object within the `scheduler` group in your Camel configuration. The type of object for the `scheduledExecutorService` option would be a `ThreadPoolExecutor` or any implementation that allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool.'
    - question: 'What is the expected format to configure the Google Sheets Stream component''s scheduler option using either camel-spring or camel-quartz, and is it required if no default value is provided?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the scheduler option for the Google Sheets Stream component using either camel-spring or camel-quartz, you should specify a string value of "spring" or "quartz" respectively in your configuration files. However, if no default value is provided, the use of a scheduler via these components is not required.'
    - question: 'How can I set up additional properties for a custom scheduler or one of the provided Quartz or Spring-based schedulers when using the Apache Camel''s Google Sheets Stream component?'
      answer: |
       'To set up additional properties for a custom scheduler or any of the provided Quartz or Spring-based schedulers when using the Apache Camel''s Google Sheets Stream component, you can configure these properties by modifying the "schedulerProperties" object. This object is optional, meaning it''s not required if you don''t need to change anything. The "schedulerProperties" is a container for additional settings that can be useful when working with custom scheduling logic. You can find more information about specific property keys and their values in the respective scheduler documentation.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and whether it''s mandatory for the ''startScheduler'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-sheets-stream'' regarding auto-starting a scheduler? (Hint: The default value is true and it''s not required.)'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component ''google-sheets-stream'', the default behavior for the ''startScheduler'' option is to automatically start the scheduler. However, it''s important to note that this setting is not mandatory, meaning you can choose to explicitly turn off automatic starting if needed.'
    - question: 'What is the default time unit for setting the `initialDelay` and `delay` options in the Apache Camel `google-sheets-stream` component''s scheduler group, and what other units can this option accept if not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The default time unit for setting the `initialDelay` and `delay` options in the Apache Camel `google-sheets-stream` component''s scheduler group is Milliseconds (MILLISECONDS). If not specified, these options will default to milliseconds. However, you can also use other units such as seconds, minutes, or hours by appending appropriate suffixes (e.g., seconds - "SECONDS", minutes - "MINUTES", hours - "HOURS"). For instance, if you want a delay of 1 minute, you would set the `delay` option to "60 SECONDS".'
    - question: 'How does setting the `useFixedDelay` option to false in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" affect its scheduling behavior, compared to when it is set to true?'
      answer: |
       'When you set the `useFixedDelay` option to false in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", it changes the scheduling behavior compared to when it''s set to true. Instead of using a fixed delay between tasks, it will now use a fixed rate, meaning that tasks will be executed at a consistent interval, but the exact time between each execution may vary depending on task completion times. This can potentially lead to more tasks being executed within the chosen time frame due to the flexibility in task execution timing. For further details, you can refer to ScheduledExecutorService in JDK for a comprehensive understanding of fixed rate and fixed delay scheduling.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and recommended best practice for using the "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", and is it required when configuring this component? Additionally, could you explain why refreshToken might be more suitable for long-term usage compared to accessToken?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" is an OAuth 2 access token used to authenticate your application with Google Sheets API. Since this token expires after an hour, it''s recommended to use the refreshToken for long-term usage. This is because refresh tokens have a longer lifespan and can be used to obtain a new access token once it expires, thus ensuring continuous authentication. The "accessToken" option is not required when configuring this component. However, providing it will allow immediate access to Google Sheets during the token''s validity period. This information falls under the security group as proper handling of these tokens is crucial for maintaining secure connections with Google APIs.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and if it''s required or optional for the "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream"?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" is a string type value that serves as the client secret of the Google Sheets application. Its default value is null, meaning it must be provided explicitly during configuration. This option falls under the security group, implying its importance in maintaining the integrity and secrecy of your Google Sheets data. Whether it''s required or not depends on the specific use case; however, it''s typically essential for secure access to your Google Sheets data via Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'How do I configure the OAuth 2 refresh token option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets Stream component to ensure that the Google Sheets component can acquire a new access token when the current one expires, in case of long-lived applications?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the OAuth 2 refresh token option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets Stream component for a long-lived application, you should follow these steps:              1. Navigate to the configuration section of your Google Sheets Stream component.              2. Locate the "OAuth 2 refresh token" option under the "security" group. This is an optional field, so if it''s not already present, consider adding it.              3. Enter the refresh token value you obtained during the OAuth 2 authorization process. This token will be used to acquire a new access token whenever the current one expires.              4. Save your configuration, and restart your application or component if necessary for the changes to take effect.              Now, your Google Sheets Stream component should be able to refresh its access token automatically when needed, ensuring smooth operation in long-lived applications.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, usage, and default value of the "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", and is it mandatory to provide this option when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" is designed to set a .json file containing your service account credentials for Google Sheets API use. This option is not mandatory, as it has a default value of null, meaning you can choose to provide your own credentials or let it run without them (though this may limit functionality). The "serviceAccountKey" group falls under the category of security considerations, as it involves handling sensitive information related to authentication and authorization.'
