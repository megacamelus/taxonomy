    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''applicationName'' option in the Apache Camel''s google-sheets-stream component, and is it required? Also, can you provide an example of how it might be used within a Camel context when configuring this component?'
      answer: |
       'The ''applicationName'' option in Apache Camel''s google-sheets-stream component is intended to specify the name of the Google Sheets application. It can take a value such as camel-google-sheets/1.0, though it doesn''t have a default value (defaultValue: null). This option is optional and grouped under ''consumer''. For instance, when configuring this component within a Camel context, you might set its applicationName like so:              ```xml       <googleSheetsStream consumer("DirectOverTCP://localhost:1234") applicationName="camel-google-sheets/1.0" />       ```       In this example, the Google Sheets application name is ''camel-google-sheets/1.0'', and it''s communicating using a TCP connection on localhost at port 1234 (consumer property).'
    - question: 'How does the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets Stream component work, and when is it useful to set it to true compared to using the default org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler?'
      answer: |
       'The `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets Stream component enables bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages will be handled by the routing Error Handler as a message, instead of being logged and ignored using the default `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler`.              However, it''s crucial to note that this functionality is only available if the third-party component allows Camel to be alerted about exceptions. Some components manage exceptions internally without notifying Camel, so `bridgeErrorHandler` may not be possible in such cases. For instances where this is supported, setting `bridgeErrorHandler` to true can be advantageous as it provides a more robust error-handling strategy, enabling you to process and respond to exceptions rather than ignoring them. When `bridgeErrorHandler` is false (the default value), the consumer uses the internal exception handler to deal with errors.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "clientId" option in the Apache Camel''s google-sheets-stream component, whether it is required or optional, its default value, its data type, and which group of options it belongs to?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option in Apache Camel''s "google-sheets-stream" component serves as a Client ID of the Google Sheets application. It is an optional field (indicated by the "required": false), meaning you don''t strictly need to provide it. Its default value is null, and its data type is string. This option falls under the group "consumer", which refers to various consumer-related options in the component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the process to use a shared configuration when setting up the "google-sheets-stream" component in Apache Camel, and is it optional to do so?'
      answer: |
       'To utilize a shared configuration for the "google-sheets-stream" component in Apache Camel, follow these steps:              1. Ensure you have the consumer group configured in your route (if not already present). The consumer group can be specified by adding `groups="consumer"` to the route definition or any of its components.              2. Define and pass an object with the desired configuration options when setting up the "google-sheets-stream" component, e.g., by using a ProducerTemplate or an Endpoint. You can obtain a shared configuration object from another source if needed. Note that passing a configuration object is optional but recommended if you wish to reuse the same settings across multiple instances of this component in your application.              3. Modify your route''s definition accordingly:              ```       from("google-sheets-stream:mySharedConfig")           ... // rest of your route definition       ```              Here, "mySharedConfig" should be the name you give to the configuration object when creating a new ProducerTemplate or an Endpoint.              By following these steps, you can employ a shared configuration for the google-sheets-stream component in Apache Camel. Using a shared configuration is optional but helps maintain consistency and manageability across your application''s instances of this component.'
    - question: 'How is the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets Stream component used when setting up a service that requires authentication with a wide-domain service account? Does it have a default value, and if not, what data type should be provided for this option?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s Google Sheets Stream component, the "delegate" option is utilized when you''re dealing with a wide-domain service account that needs authentication. This option allows you to delegate the authentication process, bypassing the need for the client-side application to handle the credentials directly. The "delegate" option does not have a default value, so when setting up your service, ensure to provide it with a string data type representing the name of the Google Service Account key file that contains the necessary credentials for authentication.'
    - question: 'Here''s a possible question about the `includeGridData` option for the Apache Camel Google Sheets Stream component:              "When using the Google Sheets Stream component in Apache Camel, what should be set to return grid data from the spreadsheet, and is it required?"'
      answer: |
       'In the Google Sheets Stream component of Apache Camel, the "includeGridData" option determines whether or not grid data (i.e., all the data in the spreadsheet including headers) should be returned. To retrieve grid data from the spreadsheet, you should set the value of this option to "true". However, it is not mandatory to set this value as its default is false and there are cases where only specific cells or rows might be required instead of the entire grid data.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" option named "majorDimension", and is it required for usage in consumer groups?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "majorDimension" option in the "google-sheets-stream" Apache Camel component is "ROWS". Its data type is "string" and it''s not required for usage within consumer groups, meaning you can choose to specify it or let it use its default value.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, datatype, requirement status, and possible group of the option "maxResults" in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream"? Also, can you explain how this option can affect the number of returned rows or value ranges?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", the option "maxResults" is designed to limit the number of results returned in a request. By default, it does not have a specific value (null), but you can specify an integer when needed. This option is optional and belongs to the consumer group.              When you set a value for "maxResults", it affects the number of rows returned in a single result set from a Google Sheets data range or the number of result sets (value ranges) returned in a batch request. For example, if you set maxResults to 10, and there are more than 10 rows in a single data range, it will return up to 10 rows at a time instead of all rows at once, improving the performance for large datasets. Similarly, if multiple value ranges are requested in a batch request, setting "maxResults" will limit the number of returned value ranges to improve processing efficiency.'
    - question: 'How should I set the `range` option in Apache Camel''s Google Sheets Stream component if I want to specify a specific area in a sheet to fetch data from, and is it necessary to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'To specify a particular region in a Google Sheet when using Apache Camel''s Google Sheets Stream component, you can set the `range` option as a string in the following format: "sheetName!range". For example, to fetch data from columns A through C of sheet1, you would write it as "sheet1!A:C". It''s not necessary to provide a value for this option if you want to retrieve all the data from the entire sheet; however, specifying a range allows you to restrict your data retrieval to the desired area of the sheet.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and required status, and what kind of data can be provided to the "scopes" option in the Apache Camel''s google-sheets-stream component, if specified, and where can one find more information about the different scopes that can be used for Google Sheets applications?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "scopes" option in the Apache Camel''s google-sheets-stream component is null, which means no specific permission level is initially granted. When specified, the "scopes" option can be provided an array of strings that define the levels of permissions you want a Google Sheets application to have to a user account. These scopes are explained in detail at <https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes>. Although it is not required, including scopes in your request can provide fine-grained control over the data and functionalities your application can access within a Google Sheets environment.'
    - question: 'How does the ''splitResults'' option within the Apache Camel ''google-sheets-stream'' component affect data processing when set to true or false, and why might a user choose to use this option in their integration scenario?'
      answer: |
       'The ''splitResults'' option within the Apache Camel ''google-sheets-stream'' component determines how your Google Sheets value range result is processed during data exchange. When set to true, each row or column becomes a separate unit in batch processing, allowing you to process individual cells more efficiently. This can be beneficial when dealing with large datasets where handling every cell individually makes tasks like manipulation or analysis easier. Conversely, when ''splitResults'' is set to false, the value range object is treated as a single unit, also known as junk size. In scenarios where each cell''s independence isn''t crucial, and data processing is faster without the need for individual cell handling, setting it to false might be preferred. Ultimately, this option caters to user preferences based on their specific integration requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "valueRenderOption" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", and is it mandatory to provide a specific value for this option when using a consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "valueRenderOption" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" is FORMATTED_VALUE. It is not mandatory to provide a specific value for this option as it determines how values should be rendered in the output, but you can choose to customize this behavior if needed.'
    - question: 'What does the "autowiredEnabled" option do in the Apache Camel Google Sheets Stream component and does it have a default value when not explicitly specified?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets Stream component determines whether autowiring is enabled for automatic configuration of components such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, etc. This feature looks up in the registry to find a single instance of matching type and configures it on the component automatically. The default value of "autowiredEnabled" is true, meaning that autowiring is enabled when this option is not explicitly specified.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "clientFactory" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-sheets-stream", and what is its default value and group? Additionally, can we specify a custom factory for creating the Google Sheets client, if yes, how is it done?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientFactory" option within the "google-sheets-stream" component of Apache Camel serves as a configuration setting to define the factory that creates instances of the GoogleSheetsClient. By default, it uses BatchGoogleSheetsClientFactory for client creation. This option belongs to advanced settings and can be configured at your discretion. To use a custom factory for creating the Google Sheets client, you may specify its instance in your configuration. For example:              ```xml       <bean id="myCustomFactory" class="YourPackageName.MyCustomGoogleSheetsClientFactory"/>       ...       <google-sheets-stream:endpoints id="myGoogleEndpoint">           <googleSheetsStreamProperty key="factory" value="#{myCustomFactory}" />           ...       </google-sheets-stream:endpoints>       ```              Here, replace "YourPackageName.MyCustomGoogleSheetsClientFactory" with the package and class name of your custom implementation. This way you can control the creation of Google Sheets clients according to your application''s needs.'
    - question: '"What is the default value and purpose of the ''healthCheckConsumerEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel''s ''google-sheets-stream'' component, and can it be omitted in the configuration if this setting is not needed?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''healthCheckConsumerEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel''s ''google-sheets-stream'' component is used to enable or disable all consumer-based health checks from this component. Its default value is true, meaning that health checks are enabled by default. If you do not require health checks for this component, you can set it to false or choose to omit the option altogether as its ''required'' value is false within the ''health'' group of configuration options.'
    - question: 'How is the default value set for the ''healthCheckProducerEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-sheets-stream'', and what is the purpose of this option regarding health checks when working with producers?'
      answer: |
       'The ''healthCheckProducerEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel ''google-sheets-stream'' component is used to enable or disable all producer-based health checks from this specific component. By default, its value is set to true, which means that producer health checks are initially enabled. This setting is important as it helps monitor the status of producers when working with health checks in Apache Camel. However, please note that Camel has disabled all producer-based health checks by default. To globally turn on producer checks, you can set ''camel.health.producersEnabled'' to true.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and requirement status of the "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", and is it recommended to use refreshToken for long-term usage due to token expiration?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" is an OAuth 2 access token used for authentication purposes. It typically expires after an hour, so it''s recommended to use "refreshToken" for long-term usage to ensure continuous access. The data type of the "accessToken" is a string, and it has a default value of null. Its requirement status is optional. This option falls under the security group due to its sensitive nature.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", and does it have a default value? Additionally, is it marked as a required option, and under which group is it classified?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" serves the purpose of providing the client secret of your Google Sheets application for secure API access. It does not have a default value, meaning you''ll need to specify it when configuring the component. Regarding its requirements, it is marked as an optional option (not required) within the "security" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of using the `refreshToken` option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets stream component, and how can its usage contribute to the security of the application? Additionally, is the use of this option mandatory, and does it have a default value if not provided explicitly?'
      answer: |
       'The `refreshToken` option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets stream component is utilized for OAuth 2 refresh token purposes. This refresh token enables the Google Sheets component to acquire a new accessToken once the current one expires, ensuring continuous functionality if your application has a long lifespan. The use of this option contributes to the security of your application by reducing the need for constant re-authentication, thereby minimizing potential security risks associated with storing sensitive information over extended periods. However, using the refreshToken is not mandatory as the component can function without it, but its absence may require more frequent re-authentication, potentially impacting application performance or availability. The `refreshToken` does not have a default value and must be provided explicitly if you wish to use it.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-sheets-stream"? Also, is this option considered necessary or optional when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel component called "google-sheets-stream" serves the purpose of setting a .json file containing the credentials for a Service Account to authenticate access to Google Sheets. Its default value is null, meaning that no such file is specified when it is not provided. This option is considered optional and can be left out in cases where you prefer to use another method for authentication or if you do not need to authenticate at all. It falls under the "security" group of options within the component settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream"? Also, is it required or optional? If it''s optional, is there a default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "applicationName" option within the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" is an optional string parameter, providing the name of the Google Sheets application. By default, this option has no set value. If left undefined, it will not affect the functionality of the component, as long as proper authentication and sheet details are provided.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientId" option in the Apache Camel''s "google-sheets-stream" component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option? (The option describes itself as the Client ID of the Google Sheets application, its type is string, it has no default value, and it is not required.)'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option in Apache Camel''s "google-sheets-stream" component represents the unique identifier assigned to your Google Sheets application during OAuth 2.0 configuration. It is used for authorization and accessing your Google Sheets data. However, it does not have a default value; you need to provide it if you wish to use this option. It belongs to the "consumer" group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of setting a delegate for the "google-sheets-stream" component''s "delegate" option in Apache Camel, and is it required to specify a default value for this option when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The purpose of setting a delegate for the "google-sheets-stream" component''s "delegate" option in Apache Camel is to use a wide-domain service account for the Google Sheets service. However, specifying a default value for this option is not required as it has a type of string and can be left empty or null if you want to use the current user''s credentials instead.'
    - question: 'How do I enable the retrieval of grid data when using the Apache Camel component Google Sheets Stream in a consumer setup? Is there a default value or a specific configuration required to include grid data in the retrieved data?'
      answer: |
       'To enable the retrieval of grid data when using the Apache Camel component Google Sheets Stream in a consumer setup, you can set the "includeGridData" option to true. By default, this option is false. However, if you wish to include grid data in the retrieved data, you should configure it as such in your routing settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "majorDimension" option when using the "google-sheets-stream" component in Apache Camel, and what are possible alternative values this option can take, as well as whether setting this option is optional?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "majorDimension" option when utilizing the "google-sheets-stream" component in Apache Camel is set to ROWS. However, it''s important to note that this option is not mandatory and can be adjusted if desired. Alternative possible values for this option include COLUMNS, which would mean results use the columns as their major dimension. The group associated with this option is "consumer".'
    - question: 'What is the default value and datatype for the option "maxResults" in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream"? Furthermore, is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the option "maxResults" in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" is null. It''s an integer type and not a mandatory parameter; its use is optional within the consumer group.'
    - question: 'What is the format for specifying the range of cells in a Google Sheet when using the ''range'' option with the Apache Camel ''google-sheets-stream'' component, and is it mandatory to provide this value? (Hint: The default value is null and its type is string.)'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel ''google-sheets-stream'' component, you can specify the range of cells in a Google Sheet using a string format for the ''range'' option. This string should contain the coordinates or cell addresses separated by commas, enclosed within apostrophes. The format is as follows:              ''SheetName!RangeAddress1, RangeAddress2, ...''              It is not mandatory to provide this value when using the ''google-sheets-stream'' component, but if you want to retrieve data from a specific range of cells in your Google Sheet, it would be necessary to use it. If no ''range'' value is provided, the component will assume that you wish to retrieve data from the entire sheet.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "scopes" option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets Stream component, and do I need to specify it when using this component? Additionally, where can I find more information about the different scope values that can be used with this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "scopes" option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets Stream component specifies the level of permissions you want an application using Google Sheets to have within a user account. It''s optional, meaning you don''t need to provide it when using this component by default. For more detailed information about the different scope values that can be used with this option, please refer to the documentation provided by Google Developers at: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes.'
    - question: 'Can you explain the functionality and purpose of the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" option named "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle", and provide details on when it should be used in a consumer configuration? Additionally, can you clarify if this option is optional (since it has default value false and required attribute set to false), and under what circumstances enabling this option might be beneficial?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" option named "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" serves to manage messages sent when the polling consumer did not find any files for processing during its idle period. Enabling this option will cause the consumer to send an empty message (no body) instead of skipping or stopping entirely. This can be useful when you want the consumer to maintain its schedule even in periods where there are no new files, helping with the consistency and visibility of the data flow. It should be noted that this option is not mandatory, as it has a default value of false and the "required" attribute set to false. However, enabling it might be beneficial under circumstances where you want uninterrupted message processing and consistent status updates from the consumer.'
    - question: 'Given the provided information about the Apache Camel component `google-sheets-stream` option `splitResults`, here''s a potential question for someone who''s working with this component:              "What does the ''splitResults'' option in the Google Sheets Stream component do, and under what circumstances might you want to set it to true rather than its default value of false?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''splitResults'' option in the Google Sheets Stream component is a boolean attribute that determines whether the value range result should be split into rows or columns for individual processing during batch processing. When set to true, each row or column is represented with a separate exchange. This might be beneficial when you want to process each cell individually, as opposed to treating the entire range as a single entity. The default value is false, meaning the entire value range object is used as an exchange junk size without splitting it into rows or columns.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the `valueRenderOption` option when using the Apache Camel `google-sheets-stream` component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `valueRenderOption` option when utilizing the Apache Camel `google-sheets-stream` component is FORMATTED_VALUE. It''s not necessary to always provide a value for this option as it has a default value.'
    - question: 'How does the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel''s google-sheets-stream component function, and when is it possible to use this feature effectively? Additionally, could you explain the default behavior when the bridgeErrorHandler option is not set or false, and any potential improvements for its future usage as stated in the component''s documentation?'
      answer: |
       'The `bridgeErrorHandler` option in Apache Camel''s `google-sheets-stream` component allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages will now be processed as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler, provided the 3rd party component supports notifying Camel when an exception has been thrown. Not all components allow for this functionality, so it''s important to ensure your specific 3rd-party component does before implementing this feature.              By default, if the `bridgeErrorHandler` option is not set or false, the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to handle exceptions. These exceptions are typically logged at either WARN or ERROR level and ignored without being converted into messages.              For future releases, potential improvements may involve modifying the Camel component to hook into the 3rd-party component and make this bridgeErrorHandler functionality possible with a broader range of components. This would allow for more consistent exception handling across different integrations utilizing the Apache Camel framework.'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel "google-sheets-stream" component handle custom error handling when the exceptionHandler option is specified, in relation to the bridgeErrorHandler option? Furthermore, can you explain the default behavior and required configuration for this option?'
      answer: |
       'When using the Apache Camel "google-sheets-stream" component, if you specify the "exceptionHandler" option, it allows you to use a custom ExceptionHandler to manage exceptions that occur within the component. However, if the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled, the "exceptionHandler" option will not be in use as the consumer takes over error handling instead. By default, the component handles errors for exceptions logged at WARN or ERROR level and silently ignores them without requiring explicit configuration. This option falls under the "consumer (advanced)" group, suggesting it''s an advanced feature to be used when necessary.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", and what purpose does it serve when set within the context of a consumer''s exchange creation?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" is null, meaning no specific exchange pattern is set by default. When you explicitly define an exchange pattern within the context of a consumer''s exchange creation, it sets up the interaction model between the producer and the consumer, governing how messages are exchanged and processed in the Camel route. The "exchangePattern" option influences message exchange behavior such as whether the producer sends one message for each consume operation or the consumer requests one or more messages to be sent by the producer.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "pollStrategy" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", and can you explain when a custom implementation of this option might be necessary? Furthermore, how can I provide my custom implementation for the "pollStrategy" option when using it with the Camel framework?'
      answer: |
       'The "pollStrategy" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" allows you to customize the error handling strategy during the poll operation, before an Exchange (a messaging container) has been created and routed within the Camel framework. By implementing a custom "PollingConsumerPollingStrategy," you can tailor the error management process according to your application''s specific needs. For instance, a custom implementation might be necessary if you need to retry failed operations, handle timeouts differently, or implement a custom backoff strategy for error situations. To provide a custom implementation of the "pollStrategy" option when using it with Camel, you will have to write a Java class that extends the "org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy" and override the necessary methods based on your requirements. After defining your custom strategy, you can register it within your route configuration for use by the "google-sheets-stream" component.'
    - question: 'How is the value of the "backoffErrorThreshold" option for the "google-sheets-stream" Apache Camel component determined, and what is its default setting when it''s not specified explicitly? Additionally, could you explain the purpose of this option in relation to the scheduler groups?'
      answer: |
       'The value of the "backoffErrorThreshold" option for the "google-sheets-stream" Apache Camel component determines the number of subsequent errors (failed due to some error) that should occur before the backoffMultiplier kicks in. This setting is crucial when dealing with temporary issues, as it allows the process to wait for a specific number of attempts before increasing the time between retries. The default value for this option is null, meaning there''s no default threshold when it''s not specified explicitly.              Regarding its relation to the scheduler groups, the "backoffErrorThreshold" falls under the "scheduler" group in Camel components. This grouping denotes that this option primarily concerns the handling and management of the scheduling mechanism for different components. In the context of your Google Sheets component, it ensures that if an error occurs while polling the sheets, the subsequent retries will be properly spaced to minimize overloading or hitting rate limits on the service.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the option `backoffIdleThreshold` in the Apache Camel Google Sheets Stream component, and can it be specified as an optional parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The `backoffIdleThreshold` option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets Stream component is an integer value that defines the number of consecutive idle polls before the `backoffMultipler` should take effect. It''s an optional parameter, meaning you don''t have to provide a value for it as its default value is null. When working with the scheduler group of settings in this component, you can choose to specify this option if you wish to customize the backoff behavior in case of idle polling scenarios.'
    - question: '"What is the purpose of the ''backoffMultiplier'' option within the ''google-sheets-stream'' component in Apache Camel, and what are some conditions under which it would be applied?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''backoffMultiplier'' option within the ''google-sheets-stream'' component in Apache Camel is designed to allow the scheduled polling consumer to backoff if there has been a specified number of subsequent idles or errors in sequence. In other words, it determines how many polls will be skipped before the next attempt is made after experiencing consecutive issues. To use this option, you must also configure the ''backoffIdleThreshold'' and/or ''backoffErrorThreshold''. This mechanism helps to mitigate issues related to network connectivity or temporary API unavailability by giving some breathing room between retries.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the delay option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", and is it required for the configuration? Additionally, where does this option belong within the given components groupings (if applicable)?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "delay" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" is an integer with a default value of 500 milliseconds. This option is not mandatory for configuration, meaning you can choose to provide a value or skip it. The "delay" option falls under the "scheduler" groupings within the given components.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel component ''google-sheets-stream'' affect the behavior of ScheduledPollConsumer, and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel component ''google-sheets-stream'' causes the ScheduledPollConsumer to run immediately again if the previous run polled one or more messages. The default value for this option is false, meaning it''s disabled by default and the consumer will wait for the scheduled interval to elapse before running again.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", and is its usage within a scheduler context optional?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" is an integer type set at 1000 milliseconds. Its usage within a scheduler context is optional as the parameter''s group is categorized under "scheduler".'
    - question: 'What is the maximum number of times a Google Sheets stream operation will be triggered in the Apache Camel context when you set the "repeatCount" option to 5, and what happens if this option is not specified or set to a value other than an integer between zero and positive numbers (inclusive)?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel context, if you set the "repeatCount" option for a Google Sheets stream component to 5, the operation will be triggered up to five times. If this option is not specified or set to a value other than an integer between zero and positive numbers (inclusive), it defaults to 0, meaning the operation will fire indefinitely, or "forever".'
    - question: 'What is the default value and allowed range of configurations for the `runLoggingLevel` option in the Apache Camel''s Google Sheets Stream component, if it is set to be optional and has a scheduler group?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the `runLoggingLevel` option in the Apache Camel''s Google Sheets Stream component, when set to be optional and under the scheduler group, is TRACE. The allowed range of configurations includes levels such as DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL (in ascending order of severity). You can adjust this setting to control the logging detail produced by the consumer whenever it polls.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "scheduledExecutorService" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", and is it necessary to configure this option for every instance of the component?'
      answer: |
       'The "scheduledExecutorService" option within the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" allows you to customize or share a thread pool to be used by the consumer, defaulting to each consumer having its own single-threaded thread pool. This option is not essential for every instance of the component, as the default configuration can suffice. However, if you wish to manage the concurrency and processing of multiple Google Sheets streams more effectively, configuring this option might be beneficial.'
    - question: 'How should I set up the scheduling option for the Apache Camel''s Google Sheets Stream component using a cron schedule, and are there any predefined schedulers provided by either camel-spring or camel-quartz components?'
      answer: |
       'To set up a cron scheduler for the Apache Camel Google Sheets Stream component using a predefined scheduler, you can use the "scheduler" option with either the "spring" or "quartz" values for the built-in schedulers provided by either camel-spring or camel-quartz components. For example:              ```yaml       googleSheetsStream:         scheduler: spring # or quartz if preferred         cronExpression: "0/5 * * 1/1 * ? *" # example of a cron expression       ```'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "schedulerProperties" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream"? How can this option be utilized when configuring a custom scheduler or using any of the provided Quartz or Spring based schedulers?'
      answer: |
       'The "schedulerProperties" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" is designed to provide additional configuration properties when you opt for a custom scheduler, or utilize any of the Quartz or Spring-based schedulers. This object-type property allows flexible control over scheduling specifics according to your project requirements. Its default value is null, meaning it is not pre-populated with any specific values in case no explicit configuration is provided. To utilize this option when configuring a custom scheduler or the given Quartz or Spring schedulers, you can specify the required properties as a key-value pair within an object, and bind it to your route''s component settings for the "google-sheets-stream."'
    - question: 'Here''s a question that can be answered using the provided information about the Apache Camel `google-sheets-stream` component''s `startScheduler` option:              "What is the default value and data type of the ''startScheduler'' option in the Apache Camel `google-sheets-stream` component, and does it require being explicitly set in the configuration?"'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the ''startScheduler'' option in the Apache Camel `google-sheets-stream` component is a boolean value (true), and it is not required to be explicitly set in the configuration as it has a default value.'
    - question: 'What is the default time unit for setting the `initialDelay` and `delay` options in the `google-sheets-stream` Apache Camel component when using scheduler groups, if a specific time unit is not provided? (The given information indicates that the default value for the option "timeUnit" is MILLISECONDS.)'
      answer: |
       'The default time unit for setting the `initialDelay` and `delay` options in the `google-sheets-stream` Apache Camel component when using scheduler groups, if no specific time unit is provided, is in MILLISECONDS.'
    - question: 'How does the Apache Camel "google-sheets-stream" component''s "useFixedDelay" option work when setting a delay between Google Sheets updates, and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "google-sheets-stream" component''s "useFixedDelay" option in Apache Camel is responsible for controlling the method used to set a delay between Google Sheets updates. When set to true (its default value), it employs a fixed delay, meaning that the time gap between each update remains consistent. This behavior can be compared to Java''s ScheduledExecutorService, which uses fixed delays. If you decide to change this option, it can also operate with a fixed rate, where the number of updates per given time period is maintained constant rather than the time gap. This group of options falls under "scheduler".'
    - question: 'What is the recommended method for maintaining a long-term OAuth 2 access token in Apache Camel''s "google-sheets-stream" component due to its typical one-hour expiration period, and how can you configure this in your code?'
      answer: |
       'To maintain a long-term usage of the OAuth 2 access token in Apache Camel''s "google-sheets-stream" component, it is recommended to use the refreshToken instead of the accessToken due to its one-hour expiration period. You can configure this by setting the `refreshToken` property when initializing the Google Sheets stream component. Here''s an example:              ```java       GoogleSheetsStream googleSheetsStream = new GoogleSheetsStream(context);       googleSheetsStream.setOAuth2ClientId("<your-client-id>");       googleSheetsStream.setOAuth2ClientSecret("<your-client-secret>");       googleSheetsStream.setRefreshToken("<your-refresh-token>"); // set refresh token instead of access token       // continue with other component configurations       ```'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component called "google-sheets-stream", and is it required when using this component, as suggested by its default value and description?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-sheets-stream" serves as the secret key for authentication of the connected Google Sheets application. While not mandatory (indicated by its default value being null), including this secret is essential for ensuring secure access to your Google Sheets data within the Camel integration context, under the security group.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the `refreshToken` option for the Apache Camel''s Google Sheets Stream component to allow the system to automatically obtain a new access token when the current one expires?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the refresh token option for the Apache Camel''s Google Sheets Stream component, you should set the "refreshToken" field under the "security" group. This option is a string type and is not mandatory. If provided, it will facilitate automatic acquisition of a new access token when the current one expires, which is essential for long-lived applications. You can update your configuration like this:              ```yaml       googleSheetsStream = googleSheetsStream()           .endpointUri("google://spreadsheet?key={YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY}")           .security().refreshToken("{YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN}");       ```       Replace `{YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY}` and `{YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN}` with the appropriate values from your Google API project settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of setting the "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream", and what type of data should it contain (if provided)? Is it required, and if not, are there specific security groups related to this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets-stream" is used to specify a .json file containing your service account credentials when accessing Google Sheets using that component. This credential file is necessary for authenticating with the Google APIs, thus granting read and write access to the specified spreadsheet. However, it''s not strictly required if you use an API key instead. The "serviceAccountKey" option should contain a JSON encoded service account key that follows this format: {"type":"service_account","project_id": "PROJECT_ID", "private_key_id": "PRIVATE_KEY_ID", ...}, and can be obtained from the Google Cloud Console under IAM & Admin > Service accounts. Keep in mind that security groups related to this option are primarily those focusing on authentication and authorization within your project, such as "security".'
