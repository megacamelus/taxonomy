seed_examples:
    - question: 'What is the purpose and optional nature of the "kubernetesClient" option in the Apache Camel OpenShift DeploymentConfigs component, and does it have a default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "kubernetesClient" option within the Apache Camel OpenShift DeploymentConfigs component serves to utilize an already existing kubernetes client if desired. This option is not mandatory, meaning you can use the component without providing it. Additionally, it does not have a default value assigned.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel''s openshift-deploymentconfigs component influence the handling of exceptions that occur within a consumer, and under what conditions might it not be possible to use this feature?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel''s openshift-deploymentconfigs component allows exceptions that occur within a consumer to be handled as messages by the routing Error Handler. This is beneficial when dealing with exceptions during message consumption, as they will no longer be ignored and instead can be processed as part of your application''s error handling strategy.              However, it is important to note that this feature may not be possible if the third-party component does not permit Camel to be notified of any exceptions thrown internally. Some components handle exceptions independently without providing a means for Camel integration. In such cases, the consumer will revert back to using the default exception handler that logs warnings or errors and ignores the exception.              If the third-party component can be configured to allow communication with Camel regarding exceptions, we may improve the relevant Camel component in future releases to accommodate this feature for better error handling.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component for OpenShift DeploymentConfigs, and when might it be beneficial to set this option to true rather than false?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option within the Apache Camel component for OpenShift DeploymentConfigs serves a purpose to control whether the producer should start lazily (on the first message) instead of during the initial startup. This is particularly useful in scenarios where starting the producer might otherwise lead to failures and prevent the route from being started successfully.              When the "lazyStartProducer" option is set to true, the startup failure will be managed through Camel''s routing error handlers, allowing the CamelContext and routes to still initiate in situations that may have previously resulted in an overall failure. Please note that when the first message is processed, there will be a slight delay as creating and starting the producer takes place. However, this might be preferable over immediately failing during startup due to a potential producer-related issue.              By default, the "lazyStartProducer" option is set to false; nevertheless, setting it to true can provide beneficial flexibility when dealing with situations where producers may have problems starting during the initial process.'
    - question: '"What is the default behavior and usage scenario of the ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel openshift-deploymentconfigs component?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel''s ''openshift-deploymentconfigs'' component is set to a default value of true. This option governs whether autowiring is enabled for automatic autowiring options within the component. In scenarios where the option has been marked as ''autowired'', it will automatically search the registry for a single instance of matching type and configure that instance onto the component, thereby simplifying configuration for various use cases such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. When not required, the option can be set to false in the ''advanced'' group configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "apiVersion" option in the Apache Camel OpenShift deploymentconfig component, and is it required to be provided when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "apiVersion" option in the Apache Camel OpenShift deploymentconfig component is a string type, with no default value. Provision of this field is optional, meaning it''s not necessary to include it when utilizing this component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''dnsDomain'' option within the Apache Camel OpenShift DeploymentConfigs component, if specified, and is it a required parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The ''dnsDomain'' option within the Apache Camel OpenShift DeploymentConfigs component serves the purpose of specifying the domain for Elastic IP (EIP) Services. If provided, it will be used to determine the FQDN of your services when exposed as an external load balancer. However, this parameter is not required and has a null default value. It falls under the group ''common'', meaning it''s one of the general configuration options you may choose to use in your deployment.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the optional KubernetesClient in the Apache Camel component openshift-deploymentconfigs, and is it required to be set if none is provided?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional KubernetesClient in the Apache Camel component "openshift-deploymentconfigs" is not set (null). Therefore, you don''t need to provide a KubernetesClient if none is intended to be used.'
    - question: 'How can I specify or configure the namespace for an Apache Camel route using the openshift-deploymentconfigs component if I don''t have a default value set?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the namespace for an Apache Camel route using the OpenShift DeploymentConfigs component without a default value, you can specify it in the `metadata.namespace` section of your deployment configuration YAML file under the `common` group. Here is an example:              ```yaml       apiVersion: apps/v1       kind: DeploymentConfig       metadata:         name: my-deploymentconfig         namespace: my-target-namespace # Replace with your desired namespace       ...       ```'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''portName'' option in the Apache Camel OpenShift DeploymentConfigs component, and is it a required parameter?'
      answer: |
       'The ''portName'' option in Apache Camel''s OpenShift DeploymentConfigs component serves for configuring the name used for ServiceCall External IP. The default value for this option is null, meaning no specific port name is set if it''s not provided. It''s an optional parameter, as indicated by its ''required'' field being false.'
    - question: 'How is the default value and data type for the `portProtocol` option when using the Apache Camel''s openshift-deploymentconfigs component in a ServiceCall Endpoint Interceptor Pattern, and is specifying this value optional?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the OpenShift DeploymentConfigs component provided by Apache Camel for the ServiceCall Endpoint Interceptor Pattern, the default value for the `portProtocol` option is TCP (denoted as "tcp"). This attribute specifies the protocol used for the ServiceCall External IP (EIP). The data type of this field is a string ("type":"string"). It is important to note that specifying this value is optional as it has a default value if not explicitly provided. Furthermore, it falls under the common group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the optional string parameter "crdGroup" in the Apache Camel openshift-deploymentconfigs component, and can it be omitted if no specific Consumer CRD Resource Group needs to be watched?'
      answer: |
       'The optional parameter "crdGroup" in the Apache Camel openshift-deploymentconfigs component is designed to specify the Consumer CRD (Custom Resource Definition) Resource Group you''d like to observe. By default, it has no set value ("defaultValue": null). If during your workflow, there''s no particular Consumer CRD Resource Group that needs monitoring, you can safely omit this parameter since it''s marked as non-required ("required": false).'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of setting the ''crdName'' option within the ''openshift-deploymentconfigs'' component in Apache Camel, and can this option be omitted if not provided? (Answer: The ''crdName'' option in ''openshift-deploymentconfigs'' component specifies the Consumer CRD Resource name to watch. It is optional, meaning it can be left blank if no particular resource name needs to be watched.)'
      answer: |
       'The ''crdName'' option within the ''openshift-deploymentconfigs'' component in Apache Camel serves to specify the Consumer Custom Resource Definition (CRD) Resource name you''d like to watch for changes. However, this option is considered optional; if no specific resource name needs to be watched, it can safely be left blank or not provided at all.'
    - question: '"What is the purpose and default value of the ''crdPlural'' option in the Apache Camel OpenShift DeploymentConfigs component when using it as a consumer, and is its use optional?"'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel OpenShift DeploymentConfigs, when used as a consumer, the ''crdPlural'' option represents the Consumer Custom Resource Definition (CRD) Resource Plural you wish to monitor. The default value for this option is null, meaning no specific CRD is specified by default. The use of ''crdPlural'' is optional since it is not marked as a required field.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "crdScope" option in the Apache Camel openshift-deploymentconfigs component, and what value does it accept if not provided by default?'
      answer: |
       'The "crdScope" option within the Apache Camel OpenShift DeploymentConfigs component is intended to define the Consumer CRD Resource Scope that you''d like to monitor. If this option is not set explicitly, it will not have a default value. It accepts string values as input and falls under the consumer group.'
    - question: 'What is the default and optional string value for the `crdVersion` option in the Apache Camel openshift-deploymentconfigs component, if it is used to specify the Consumer CRD Resource Version we would like to watch?'
      answer: |
       'The `defaultValue` for the `crdVersion` option in the Apache Camel `openshift-deploymentconfigs` component, which specifies the Consumer CRD Resource Version you''d like to watch, is null. This means that if no value is provided for this option, it will not be set. However, you can provide a string value if needed, as indicated by its `type`.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''labelKey'' option in the Apache Camel component ''openshift-deploymentconfigs'', and what value should it have if a Consumer Label is not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The ''labelKey'' option in the Apache Camel OpenShift DeploymentConfigs component serves to specify the Consumer Label key when observing certain resources. However, if no specific Consumer Label is provided, this ''labelKey'' value should be set to null.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "labelValue" option within the "openshift-deploymentconfigs" component in Apache Camel, and is its usage marked as required?'
      answer: |
       'The "labelValue" option within the "openshift-deploymentconfigs" component in Apache Camel serves the purpose of providing a Consumer Label value when observing certain resources. However, it does not have a default value. Its usage is marked as optional, meaning that it can be used if needed, but it''s not necessary for the operation. The group associated with this option is "consumer".'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "poolSize" option in the Apache Camel "openshift-deploymentconfigs" component, if it''s not mandatory to provide a value for this option, and what kind of data type does it accept?'
      answer: |
       'The "poolSize" option in the Apache Camel "openshift-deploymentconfigs" component is a configuration setting for defining the Consumer pool size. It determines how many consumer threads are used to process messages simultaneously in the component. By default, its value is set to 1, but it''s not required to specify a value if desired behavior is to use only one consumer thread. The "poolSize" option accepts integer data types, allowing you to configure the number of consumer threads based on your specific requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the resourceName option when using the openshift-deploymentconfigs component in Apache Camel for setting up a consumer, and is it required?'
      answer: |
       'The `resourceName` option, when working with the `openshift-deploymentconfigs` component within Apache Camel, serves as an identifier for the Consumer Resource Name you wish to monitor. It''s optional, meaning that if not provided, it will have no default value (as stated in your information). This option is particularly useful under the "consumer" group of options, enabling you to set up a consumer based on your specified resource name within the OpenShift deployment configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''bridgeErrorHandler'' option in the Apache Camel ''openshift-deploymentconfigs'' component, and under what circumstances can it be configured to allow a consumer to route exceptions as messages to the Camel routing Error Handler?'
      answer: |
       'The ''bridgeErrorHandler'' option within the Apache Camel ''openshift-deploymentconfigs'' component allows for bridging consumers to the Camel routing Error Handler, enabling any exceptions (if compatible with the third-party component) that occur during the process of the consumer trying to pick up incoming messages to be handled as messages by the routing Error Handler. This functionality is contingent upon the third-party component supporting the alert mechanism for exceptions, as some components manage exceptions internally. In instances where this is not possible, efforts are being made to improve the Camel component to accommodate integration with the third-party component in future releases to enable such a configuration. By default, the consumer will utilize the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler` to address exceptions, which will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and then ignored.'
    - question: 'How can you customize exception handling when using the Apache Camel openshift-deploymentconfigs component by specifying a custom ExceptionHandler, and what will happen if bridgeErrorHandler is enabled or disabled in this case?'
      answer: |
       'To customize exception handling when utilizing the Apache Camel openshift-deploymentconfigs component, you can specify a custom ExceptionHandler. When you set the "exceptionHandler" option, your defined exception handler will be used instead of the default one provided by the component.              However, if the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled, this means that error messages will be automatically forwarded to the consumer without handling exceptions locally. In this case, using the "exceptionHandler" option becomes unnecessary as the consumer itself would deal with the exceptions.              When "exceptionHandler" and "bridgeErrorHandler" are not set or disabled, by default the component will log exceptions that appear at WARN or ERROR level and ignore them, leaving the responsibility of handling these exceptions to the consumer. This behavior can be adjusted according to your use case when you decide to implement a custom ExceptionHandler or enable/disable bridgeErrorHandler.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel OpenShift DeploymentConfigs component under the consumer (advanced) group, if it is not required? Can you also provide an example of a valid configuration using this option to set a specific exchange pattern when creating an exchange?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel OpenShift DeploymentConfigs component, under the consumer (advanced) group, allows you to customize the exchange pattern when a consumer creates an exchange. It is not required by default and has no set value. A valid configuration using this option would look something like this:              ```yaml       apiVersion: v1       kind: DeploymentConfig       metadata:         name: my-consumer       spec:         selector: app=my-camel         template:           spec:             containers:             - name: my-camel               image: myregistry/my-camel:latest             strategy:               type: Recreate             lifecycle:               persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain             consumer:               advanced:                 exchangePattern: "InOut"       ```              In the above example, we are setting the exchange pattern to ''InOut'', which means both incoming and outgoing messages will be processed within a single exchange. Please adjust the ''exchangePattern'' value according to your use case, as there are other options available such as "InOnly", "OutOnly", or "Fixed". For more detailed information on each option, refer to the Apache Camel documentation for Exchanges and Exchange Patterns.'
    - question: 'What possible string values can be set for the "operation" option under the "producer" group of the Apache Camel "openshift-deploymentconfigs" component when working with Kubernetes, and is it required? (Note: The default value is null)'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel "openshift-deploymentconfigs" component within Kubernetes, the "operation" option under the "producer" group can be set to any string value you deem appropriate for your operation. However, it''s important to note that this option is not mandatory as its default value is null. The specific values for the "operation" option depend on the context and the desired Kubernetes operations for your producer application.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component "openshift-deploymentconfigs" influence the behavior of the producer during route startup, and what are its potential impacts on processing time?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component "openshift-deploymentconfigs" allows for a more flexible approach to starting producers during route initialization. Instead of launching the producer immediately, it will start only upon receiving the first message (which could happen later). This feature is beneficial in scenarios where the producer may initially fail during startup and cause the entire route to fail as well.              When using this "lazy" start option, any such startup failures can be managed through Camel''s routing error handlers during message processing. However, please note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer might take a little additional time compared to an immediate startup at route creation, which could extend the overall processing duration of the system. It''s crucial to consider this trade-off based on your specific use case and requirements.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the connectionTimeout option in the Apache Camel openshift-deploymentconfigs component, and is it required or optional? If not required, is there a recommended best practice for setting this option for optimal performance?'
      answer: |
       'The `connectionTimeout` option in the Apache Camel''s openshift-deploymentconfigs component is an optional integer type property. It specifies the connection timeout in milliseconds to use when making requests to the Kubernetes API server. By default, it does not have a set value, allowing you to customize it as needed for your application performance optimization. When setting this option, consider adjusting the value based on the expected network conditions and the speed of your deployment to strike an optimal balance between responsiveness and reliability.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "caCertData" option in the Apache Camel component "openshift-deploymentconfigs", and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "caCertData" option in the Apache Camel component "openshift-deploymentconfigs" serves as a placeholder for the CA (Certificate Authority) Certificate Data, which is primarily used within the "security" group to validate SSL certificates when using TLS/SSL connections. However, providing a value for this option is not mandatory as it has been designated as an optional parameter when utilizing this component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "caCertFile" option in the Apache Camel OpenShift DeploymentConfigs component and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "caCertFile" option within the Apache Camel OpenShift DeploymentConfigs component serves as a location to provide a Certificate Authority (CA) Certificate file for security purposes. This is an optional field, meaning its presence is not compulsory when configuring your deployment. When specified, it helps establish trust between components by verifying the authenticity of certificates exchanged during communication.'
    - question: 'How is the "Client Cert Data" option used in the Apache Camel OpenShift DeploymentConfigs component different from other components when it comes to security and how can this option be utilized, considering it''s an optional string type and has no default value?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel OpenShift DeploymentConfigs, the "Client Cert Data" option is a security-focused feature that allows you to provide a client certificate for authentication purposes when interacting with certain services or APIs. Unlike other components where security might be handled differently (such as through API keys, basic auth, or OAuth), this option leverages X.509 certificates for enhanced security. Although it''s an optional string type and has no default value, you can utilize the Client Cert Data by explicitly setting it with your desired client certificate data when deploying DeploymentConfigs. This allows your OpenShift application to present a trusted identity during interactions that require certificated-based authentication.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and if optional, the default value for the `clientCertFile` option in the Apache Camel''s `openshift-deploymentconfigs` component within the security group?'
      answer: |
       'The `clientCertFile` option within the "security" group of the Apache Camel''s `openshift-deploymentconfigs` component is designed for providing a client certificate file. This option enables SSL or TLS client authentication in certain scenarios, where the client is required to present a certificate for secure communication. However, it''s an optional setting, meaning that if not specified, it will have no default value. You would need to provide a valid path to your client certificate file when configuring this option to activate SSL/TLS client authentication in your deployment configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default key algorithm used by the client when utilizing the Apache Camel OpenShift DeploymentConfigs component with the "clientKeyAlgo" option, and is it required? Also, in what group does this security-related option belong?'
      answer: |
       'The default Key Algorithm used by the client when utilizing the Apache Camel OpenShift DeploymentConfigs component with the "clientKeyAlgo" option is not specified by default (null). This option, falling under the "security" group, is optional, meaning it''s not required to provide a value for it. However, you can specify a string value if necessary to set the desired Key Algorithm used by the client in your application''s configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the optional string parameter "clientKeyData" within the context of using the Apache Camel openShift-deploymentconfigs component, especially with regards to its relationship with security? Is it required for deployment configurations in OpenShift, and if not, what scenario might call for its usage?'
      answer: |
       'The optional parameter "clientKeyData" within the context of using the Apache Camel''s openSHIFT-deploymentconfigs component is designed to hold Client Key data. This data, falling under the security group, is not a requirement for deployment configurations in OpenShift; however, it can be useful when additional security measures are desired. A scenario where its usage might be pertinent is during interactions involving sensitive resources or communication methods requiring a client key for authentication and/or encryption purposes. When the "clientKeyData" parameter is omitted, no default value is assigned to it in the deployment configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and whether it''s mandatory to provide a client key file when using the openshift-deploymentconfigs component in Apache Camel, if not provided, does it have a default value?'
      answer: |
       'The Client Key file ("component":"openshift-deploymentconfigs", "option":"clientKeyFile") is used for security purposes when interacting with OpenShift DeploymentConfigs using Apache Camel. While providing this file is not mandatory, as indicated by the "required": false, it can enhance the security of your operations. In case you choose not to provide a client key file, there is no default value assigned to it.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientKeyPassphrase" option in the Apache Camel component "openshift-deploymentconfigs", and is it a mandatory or optional parameter? (Answer: It is an optional string parameter used for security purposes, with no default value.)'
      answer: |
       'The "clientKeyPassphrase" option in the Apache Camel component "openshift-deploymentconfigs" serves as an optional string parameter utilized for enhancing the component''s security. It doesn''t have a default value assigned to it.'
    - question: 'How is an OAuth token used for authentication in Apache Camel''s openshift-deploymentconfigs component if it''s provided? Is the oauthToken option required or can it be set as an optional parameter, and what is its data type?'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s openshift-deploymentconfigs component, the OAuth token is used for authentication purposes under the ''security'' group. If provided, it will be treated as a string data type (type: "string"). However, using an OAuth token is not required (required: false). You can configure this component to either always use the same token or pass it as an optional parameter at runtime, depending on your deployment configuration needs.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and optional nature of the ''password'' option in the Apache Camel openshift-deploymentconfigs component, and why does it not have a default value set?'
      answer: |
       'The ''password'' option within the Apache Camel''s openshift-deploymentconfigs component serves the purpose of providing a password for Kubernetes connection. Since security is a crucial aspect while dealing with such sensitive information, this option is not required but optional. It does not have a default value set because it is considered best practice to never store credentials in code or configuration files without proper encryption and access control mechanisms. This helps ensure that your cluster remains secure at all times.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "trustCerts" option in the Apache Camel OpenShift DeploymentConfigs component affect certificate trust, and is it mandatory to set this option?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "trustCerts" option in the Apache Camel OpenShift DeploymentConfigs component allows you to define if the certificates used by your application are considered trusted. If set to true, your application will trust these certificates; otherwise, it may reject them as untrusted. This option is not mandatory to set, meaning it can be left to its default value (null) or intentionally set to false to explicitly deny trust for the specified certificates. From a security perspective, this setting pertains to managing trust relationships in your deployment.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "username" option in the Apache Camel''s openshift-deploymentconfigs component, and what data type should it have if a value is provided? Furthermore, is providing a value for this option required, and does it have a default value in case one is not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The "username" option in Apache Camel''s openshift-deploymentconfigs component is designed for specifying a username for connecting to Kubernetes. If a value is provided for this option, it should be of type string. Providing a value for the "username" option is not mandatory as it has a default value of null. The group associated with this option is "security".'
