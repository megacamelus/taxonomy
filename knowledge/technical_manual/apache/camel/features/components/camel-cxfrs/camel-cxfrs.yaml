    - question: 'Given the information you provided about the Apache Camel cxfrs component''s bridgeErrorHandler option, here is a question you could ask:              "What is the purpose of the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel cxfrs component, and under what conditions will it route exceptions to the Camel routing Error Handler?"'
      answer: |
       'The purpose of the `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel `cxfrs` component is to enable bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which means that any exceptions (if possible) occurring while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. However, this is only possible if the 3rd party component allows Camel to be notified of an exception being thrown. If the component handles exceptions internally only, then `bridgeErrorHandler` is not possible. In situations where it can be implemented, it may improve future versions of the Camel component to connect with the 3rd party component and make this bridge possible. By default, if no `bridgeErrorHandler` is specified, the consumer will use the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler` to handle exceptions, which will log them at WARN or ERROR level and ignore them.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel CXFRS component, and when should it be set to true to defer the startup of a producer?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option within the Apache Camel CXFRS component is designed to control whether the associated producer should start up lazily, that is, on the first message processed instead of during initial route setup. This setting can be useful when a producer may fail during startup and cause the route to fail as well, thus preventing a successful start. By deferring the startup to lazy, you can handle any potential failure during message routing using Camel''s error handlers. However, take note that since creating and starting the producer on the first message may require some time, it could potentially prolong the total processing duration for your messages. Its default value is false, but setting it to true only when a producer might fail during startup can help ensure smooth route initialization in those situations.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and possible options of the autowiredEnabled option in the Apache Camel cxfrs component, and under what circumstances could it be useful to disable this feature?'
      answer: |
       'The `autowiredEnabled` option in the Apache Camel cxfrs component controls whether autowiring is enabled for automatic configuring of resources such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. Its default value is true, meaning autowiring is turned on. If you want to disable it, you can set this option to false. Disabling autowiring may be useful when you want more explicit control over the configuration of these resources, or if you''re dealing with complex scenarios where auto-configuration could lead to unwanted interactions or conflicts.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "headerFilterStrategy" option in the Apache Camel component ''cxfrs'', and is its use optional or required? (Hint: It is an object type, has a custom function as value, and its presence in the configuration group is not mandatory.)'
      answer: |
       'The "headerFilterStrategy" option in the Apache Camel component ''cxfrs'' is designed to enable the use of a custom org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy. This option allows you to filter headers both to and from Camel messages. The default value for this option is null, meaning no default strategy is set. Its usage is optional as indicated by the ''required:false'' property in its definition.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the Apache Camel CXFRS component option "useGlobalSslContextParameters" impact the configuration when using SSL context in security settings, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "useGlobalSslContextParameters" option for the Apache Camel CXFRS component allows you to utilize global SSL context parameters in your security setup. When this feature is set to true, any changes made to the SSL context settings will apply across all components that make use of this setting. By default, this option is disabled (false), meaning each component has its own local SSL context parameters. If you choose to enable it, ensure your global SSL context settings are well configured for the intended security requirements in your groups marked as "security".'
    - question: 'What are some examples of feature values that can be used in the "features" option of the Apache Camel cxfrs component, and what is the default value for this option if no value is provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "features" option within the Apache Camel cxfrs component allows you to specify a list of features that will be active for the CxfRs endpoint. Some examples of feature values include "FullStack", "RestStack", "BindingFile", "Jaxrs2Browser", and "Jaxrs2Provider". Note that these are just some examples, as there may be additional features depending on your specific use case. The default value for this option is null, meaning if no features are explicitly provided, none will be set.'
    - question: 'What purpose does the ''modelRef'' option serve in the Apache Camel cxfrs component, and is it optional or required? Also, can you provide an example of how this option may be used to emulate a document-only endpoint, given that the service class can be omitted when using the ''modelRef'' option?'
      answer: |
       'The ''modelRef'' option in the Apache Camel cxfrs component is used to specify a model file for the resource class without annotation. This is beneficial when you wish to create document-only endpoints, as it allows you to omit the service class. By using this option, the service class can be omitted emulating document-only endpoints. For instance, if you have a WSDL file (let''s call it `myModel.wsdl`), you can set ''modelRef'' to this file as follows:              ```java       from("direct:start")           .cxfrs()               .modelPath(new ClassPathResource("myModel.wsdl")) // specify the model file               .serviceClass(null) // omit service class, since we are using ''modelRef'' option               .to("mock:result");       ```              With this configuration, you create a Camel route that uses the WSDL file as the model without specifying a service class, thus emulating a document-only endpoint.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "providers" option within the Apache Camel cxfrs component, and how can you set custom JAX-RS providers to a CxfRs endpoint by specifying a string list of providers in the registry separated by commas, and is it required when using this component? (Optional) Can you also provide an example of how to use this option with a valid provider name.'
      answer: |
       'The "providers" option within the Apache Camel cxfrs component allows you to set custom JAX-RS providers to the CxfRs endpoint. You can specify a comma-separated string list of providers to look up in the registry when using this option. This option is not mandatory, as the component will use its default providers if you don''t provide a custom list.              For instance, to set custom JAX-RS providers for your CxfRs endpoint, you can define it like this:              ```java       from("direct:myEndpoint")           .to("cxfrs://localhost:8080/myService?providers=MyCustomProvider1, MyCustomProvider2");       ```              In the above example, "MyCustomProvider1" and "MyCustomProvider2" are the names of the providers you want to use, which should be registered in the Camel registry. Ensure these providers implement the JAX-RS provider interface (either `javax.ws.rs.ext.Provider` or one of its sub-interfaces).'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "resourceClasses" option in the Apache Camel cxfrs component, and what type of value should it receive if provided, along with a brief explanation of the default value and whether its use is required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "resourceClasses" option within the Apache Camel cxfrs component serves to specify the resource classes that you wish to export as a REST service. These resources can be defined as multiple classes, with each one separated by a comma. This option is optional, meaning that providing it is not mandatory for your configuration. If no value is provided for this option, the default is null.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the `schemaLocations` option within the Apache Camel cxfrs component, and is it a required configuration option?'
      answer: |
       'The `schemaLocations` option in the Apache Camel cxfrs component is used to set the locations of the schema(s) that can be utilized for validating incoming XML or JAXB-driven JSON. By default, there is no default value assigned to this option, meaning it may or may not be provided during configuration. Lastly, `schemaLocations` is not a required configuration option within the common groups in this context.'
    - question: 'How can you configure Apache Camel cxfrs component to avoid logging the Fault that it catches, and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'To configure Apache Camel''s cxfrs component to avoid logging the Fault that it catches, you need to set the "skipFaultLogging" option to true in your configuration. This option is of type boolean, with a default value of false if not specified. The "skipFaultLogging" option is included in the common group of options. Here''s an example of how to use this option:              ```xml       <bean id="cxfrs" class="org.apache.camel.component.cxf.CxfEndpoint">           <property name="serviceClass" value="YourServiceInterface"/>           <!-- Set skipFaultLogging to true if you want to avoid logging Faults caught by the component -->           <property name="option" value="skipFaultLogging=true"/>       </bean>       ```'
    - question: 'How does setting the Apache Camel cxfrs component''s bindingStyle option to "SimpleConsumer" affect request and response mapping compared to its default value, and how can we use a custom binding style with this component?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the Apache Camel cxfrs component''s bindingStyle option to "SimpleConsumer" significantly changes how requests and responses are mapped compared to its default value. In the SimpleConsumer mode, it processes request parameters, multiparts, etc., and maps them to IN headers, IN attachments, and the message body. This eliminates low-level processing of org.apache.cxf.message.MessageContentsList in favor of providing more flexibility and simplicity to response mapping, a feature only available for consumers. Conversely, the default binding style requires low-level MessageContentsList processing within the route, passing it directly onto the IN message body.              To use a custom binding style with this component, you can choose the "Custom" option, allowing you to specify your custom binding through the binding option.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and behavior of the ''publishedEndpointUrl'' option in the Apache Camel CXFRS component, and when is it considered optional (true/false) according to its default value and group associations?'
      answer: |
       'The ''publishedEndpointUrl'' option in the Apache Camel CXFRS component allows you to override the endpoint URL that gets published from the WADL. This URL can be accessed using the resource address URL plus ''_wadl''. When using this option, the published URL deviates from the default URL specified in the WADL. It is considered optional as its default value is null, meaning you do not need to use it if desired. The ''consumer'' group of options is associated with this feature, indicating that it is relevant for consuming REST services.'
    - question: 'Given the information provided, here is a possible question about the Apache Camel component cxfrs option named bridgeErrorHandler:              What are the consequences of setting the cxfrs component''s "bridgeErrorHandler" option to true when using it as a consumer, compared to leaving it at its default value (false)? Also, can you explain under what circumstances this option may not be possible in some components and how Camel handles exceptions if "bridgeErrorHandler" is not used?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "bridgeErrorHandler" option of the Apache Camel component cxfrs to true allows any exceptions that occur while the consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages to be handled by the routing Error Handler as messages, rather than being logged at a WARN or ERROR level and ignored (which is the default behavior). This can be beneficial for comprehensive error handling and managing failed messages within your application.              However, it''s essential to note that not all third-party components may support this functionality. In situations where the component manages exceptions internally only, the "bridgeErrorHandler" option cannot be utilized. If the "bridgeErrorHandler" is not used, Camel will employ the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler for handling exceptions, logging them at either WARN or ERROR level and ignoring them.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the exceptionHandler option in the Apache Camel cxfrs component and when does it not come into play, as indicated in the description? Also, what happens by default if the custom ExceptionHandler is not provided, and where can this option be found under in the grouping of options for the consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The exceptionHandler option within the Apache Camel cxfrs component allows the consumer to use a custom ExceptionHandler. However, if the bridgeErrorHandler is enabled, this option does not come into play. By default, if no custom ExceptionHandler is provided, exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level will be handled by the consumer and ignored. The exceptionHandler can be found under the "consumer (advanced)" grouping of options for the consumer.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and purpose of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel cxfrs component, and are there any specific scenarios or groupings where it is required to be configured? Additionally, if not provided, does it have a default value and what type of object is it expected to receive?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel cxfrs component is optional and sets the exchange pattern when a consumer creates an exchange. If not specified, it doesn''t have a default value. This option is considered part of advanced settings under the "consumer (advanced)" grouping, meaning it might not be necessary for basic usage scenarios. However, configuring it provides flexibility to control the exchange behavior in more complex or specific use cases. It is expected to receive an object as its type.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "serviceBeans" option within the Apache Camel cxfrs component and how should it be formatted if you want to define multiple beans in a list, when using this component as a consumer in advanced configurations?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceBeans" option within the Apache Camel cxfrs component is utilized for specifying the service beans (bean ids from the registry) that you intend to expose as REST services. If you wish to define multiple beans in a list, separate them by commas when using this option in advanced consumer configurations. For instance, if your intention is to expose two services named "serviceA" and "serviceB", you should format your serviceBeans option as follows: "serviceA,serviceB". Keep in mind that the "serviceBeans" option is marked as optional, and can be set according to your needs in consumer (advanced) configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''cookieHandler'' option in the Apache Camel cxfrs component, and is it required when using it as a producer? Also, could you provide an example of how to configure this option if one wishes to use it?'
      answer: |
       'The ''cookieHandler'' option in the Apache Camel cxfrs (Cxf Web Services) component is designed to allow configuration of a cookie handler for maintaining an HTTP session. This option is optional, meaning it can be set if needed but is not mandatory for using this component as a producer. By default, it has no preset value (defaultValue: null).              To configure this option, you need to provide an object with the necessary properties when defining your cxfrs component in Camel context. Here''s an example of how to set up ''cookieHandler'':              ```java       CookieHandler myCookieHandler = new CookieSupport();              CxfProducer cxfProducer = context.createProducer(new CxfComponent(server()));       Map<String, Object> options = new HashMap<>();       options.put("cookieHandler", myCookieHandler);       cxfProducer.setOptions(options);       ```              In this example, `myCookieHandler` is an instance of the `org.apache.camel.spi.CookieSupport` class that you can configure as needed for handling cookies in your specific use case. Once set, the ''cookieHandler'' option can be utilized when using the cxfrs component as a producer to manage HTTP sessions more effectively.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "hostnameVerifier" option in the Apache Camel cxfrs component, and is it required when using this component for producing SOAP messages? Additionally, can you provide a brief explanation of how to use # notation for referencing a HostnameVerifier from the registry in this context?'
      answer: |
       'The "hostnameVerifier" option in the Apache Camel cxfrs component is an optional setting used to specify the hostname verifier that will be employed during SSL handshakes. If no value is provided, it defaults to null, meaning that the system''s default hostname verifier is utilized. When producing SOAP messages with this component, providing a hostnameVerifier is not required but can be used for custom verification purposes, such as verifying server certificates.              In your configuration, you can use the "#" notation to reference a HostnameVerifier from the registry. This allows you to reuse previously defined hostname verifiers, making your code more modular and easier to manage. To do this, ensure that the HostnameVerifier you wish to use has been registered in the Camel context before referencing it via "#YourRegistredHostnameVerifier". For example:              ```java       HostnameVerifier myVerifier = new MyCustomHostnameVerifier(); // Your custom verifier class here       context.getRegistry().bind("MyCustomHostnameVerifier", myVerifier);              CxfProducer producer = ... ; // Producer initialization here       producer.setProperty(Exchange.HTTP_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER, "#MyCustomHostnameVerifier");       ```'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "sslContextParameters" option within the Apache Camel cxfrs component, and is it required or optional when using a producer? Additionally, what is the default value for this option and which group(s) does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The "sslContextParameters" option within the Apache Camel cxfrs component is used to configure SSL settings, specifically an SSL context. This can be referenced in your code using the ''#'' notation. Its use allows for secure communication over HTTPS or other SSL/TLS protocols. It is an optional setting, meaning you are not required to provide it when creating a producer using this component. The default value for this option is null, and it falls under the "producer" group of settings.'
    - question: 'How does setting the "throwExceptionOnFailure" option in the Apache Camel cxfrs component impact its behavior, and what is its default value when not explicitly specified?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "throwExceptionOnFailure" option in the Apache Camel cxfrs (CXF REST) component instructs it to check return codes from the server. If the return code exceeds 207, an Exception will be thrown. By default, this option is set to true, meaning that exceptions will be thrown when a failure response with a code greater than 207 is received. However, this behavior can be altered if the option is explicitly specified during configuration, as its "required" value is false within the "producer" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel cxfrs component''s httpClientAPI option in terms of invoking a service using either the HttpClientAPI or ProxyClientAPI, and under what group settings can this option be configured?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel CxfRsProducer''s httpClientAPI option determines whether it should use the HttpClientAPI or the ProxyClientAPI to call a service. By default, it is set to true, which means it will employ the HttpClientAPI for invocation. This setting can be configured under the "producer (advanced)" group if you need more control over how the service is invoked. If you wish to use the ProxyClientAPI instead, you may set the httpClientAPI option to false accordingly.'
    - question: 'In the context of Apache Camel''s cxfrs component, when working with an HTTP API using the DELETE method, what is the purpose of setting the "ignoreDeleteMethodMessageBody" option to true, and in which configuration group does this option belong (if not all configurations)?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s cxfrs component when working with an HTTP API using the DELETE method, setting the "ignoreDeleteMethodMessageBody" option to true tells CxfRsProducer to disregard the message body of the DELETE request. This is useful in cases where the DELETE operation does not require a message body, such as for operations that merely delete resources based on their identifiers or URLs. The configuration group for this option belongs to "producer (advanced)" within the component''s settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel component cxfrs option called "lazyStartProducer" and when would it be beneficial to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "cxfrs" component''s "lazyStartProducer" option in Apache Camel allows a producer to be started lazily, meaning upon the first message processing rather than during the startup of the route. This option is beneficial when a producer may fail during startup and cause the entire route to fail. By deferring the producer''s startup to be lazy, it permits handling the startup failure through Camel''s routing error handlers instead of blocking the route startup. However, note that starting the producer lazily may slightly prolong the overall processing time as the creation and starting of the producer occurs when processing the first message.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the maxClientCacheSize option when using the Apache Camel cxfrs component, and can this configuration be considered necessary for regular use? Additionally, in which group of options does this feature belong (if applicable)?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "maxClientCacheSize" option in the Apache Camel cxfrs component is 10. This option allows you to configure the maximum size of the cache for CXF clients or ClientFactoryBean within CxfProvider and CxfRsProvider. While not essential for regular use, setting this value can optimize resource utilization if you expect a large number of requests that require similar clients. The "maxClientCacheSize" feature belongs to the advanced group called "producer".'
    - question: 'Can you explain the purpose of the "synchronous" option within the Apache Camel cxfrs component, its default value, whether it is required to use, and under which group (production or advanced) this option belongs?'
      answer: |
       'The "synchronous" option within the Apache Camel cxfrs component controls whether strictly synchronous processing should be used. Its default value is false, meaning asynchronous processing is typically used. You can choose to set it to true for synchronous processing, but note that it''s not required and is grouped under the "producer (advanced)" category in the Camel configuration options, indicating its use may be more appropriate for advanced users or specific production scenarios.'
    - question: 'How do you set a custom CxfBinding to control the binding between Apache Camel Message and CXF Message using the Apache Camel cxfrs component? Can you provide an example of how to use this option if it is not required by default, and what type of object it accepts?'
      answer: |
       'To set a custom CxfBinding to control the binding between an Apache Camel Message and a CXF Message using the Apache Camel cxfrs component, you can do so by explicitly defining it in your route configuration when the usage is not required by default. Here''s an example of how to use this option:              ```java       from("direct:start")           .component(CxfrsComponent.cxfrs().binding(new MyCustomCxfBinding()))           ...       ```              In the above example, `MyCustomCxfBinding` represents a custom binding implementation class that extends `org.apache.cxf.ext.binding.DataBinding` or `org.apache.cxf.binding.soap.SoapBinding`. The custom binding can be used to control aspects like serialization, deserialization, and message transformation between Camel and CXF messages.              Note that this option accepts an object of type "object", which means you are free to define the structure and properties of your custom CxfBinding as per your requirements. The group attribute is set to "advanced", indicating that this feature might not be necessary for most use cases.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "bus" option in the Apache Camel cxfrs component, and is it optional to use this option during configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "bus" option within the Apache Camel CXF component (cxfrs) is intended for using a custom-configured CXF Bus. It does not have a default value and its usage can be considered optional as it belongs to the advanced configuration group, meaning it''s not always required to configure this option during setup.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "continuationTimeout" option in the Apache Camel cxfrs component and what is its default value, type, and is it mandatory to use? Also, in which groups of options does this setting belong to (if any)?'
      answer: |
       'The "continuationTimeout" option in the Apache Camel cxfrs component is used to set a timeout for CXF continuations, specifically when the CXF server is utilizing Jetty or Servlet transport. This option is optional as it has a default value of 30000 (milliseconds or 30 seconds). Its type is "duration". The group this setting belongs to is labeled as "advanced", which indicates that it may not be necessary for common usage but is provided for more specialized configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and functionality of the Apache Camel cxfrs option called "cxfRsConfigurer" and can it be configured programmatically? Also, is there a default value for this option and is its usage considered an advanced feature in Apache Camel?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel cxfrs option named "cxfRsConfigurer" allows for a programmatic configuration of CXF (Apache''s implementation of the Java API for XML Web Services) endpoints. By implementing the `configure{Server/Client}` methods within the `CxfEndpointConfigurer` class, users can tailor their CXF server and client setup to their specific needs. It''s worth noting that there is no default value associated with this option, and its usage is considered an advanced feature in Apache Camel due to its more specialized purpose.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "defaultBus" option in the Apache Camel cxfrs component, and can its usage be considered mandatory?'
      answer: |
       'The "defaultBus" option within the Apache Camel CXF component allows you to set the default bus when a CXF endpoint creates a bus by itself. Its default value is false, which means that the component will not create a bus by default. Usage of this option can be considered advanced, as it''s optional and only needed in specific cases where custom management of buses is required.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel cxfrs component option "headerFilterStrategy" and can it be used with a custom implementation if so, how does one provide a custom HeaderFilterStrategy in a Camel route?'
      answer: |
       'The `headerFilterStrategy` option within the Apache Camel `cxfrs` component serves to apply a custom strategy for filtering headers of incoming and outgoing messages in Camel''s data exchange. Although its default value is null, you can provide a custom implementation should the need arise. To use a custom `HeaderFilterStrategy`, create a new Java class that extends `org.apache.camel.processor.header.AbstractHeaderFilterStrategy` or `org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy`.              Once your custom implementation is ready, include it in your Camel application using the `@Component` annotation from Apache Camel''s spring-component module or register it with the Camel context manually. Finally, set your custom class as the value for the `headerFilterStrategy` option within your Camel route configuration:              ```java       from("cxfrs://yourEndpoint")           .headerFilterStrategy(YourCustomHeaderFilterStrategy.class);       ```              In this example, replace "yourEndpoint" with the appropriate endpoint URL and `YourCustomHeaderFilterStrategy` with your custom implementation class name. This should enable you to use your custom HeaderFilterStrategy for filtering headers in a Camel route.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "performInvocation" option in the Apache Camel cxfrs component, and can it be considered as a required setting? (Answer: The "performInvocation" option in the Apache Camel cxfrs component determines whether Camel will execute the resource class instance and put the response object into the exchange for further processing. Its default value is false, and it can be considered as an advanced configuration option, not necessarily required for basic usage.)'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel cxfrs component, the "performInvocation" option is designed to control whether Camel will execute the resource class instance and put the response object into the exchange for further processing. By default, this option is set to false. It should be noted that while this setting can greatly affect the behavior of the cxfrs component, it is considered an advanced configuration option and not a requirement for basic usage.'
    - question: 'Here is a question that utilizes the information provided for Apache Camel component cxfrs and its "propagateContexts" option:              "Can you explain the functionality of the ''propagateContexts'' option in the Apache Camel CXFRS component, and when it is advantageous to set it to true?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''propagateContexts'' option in the Apache Camel CXFRS component enables JAX-RS UriInfo, HttpHeaders, Request, and SecurityContext contexts to be accessible as typed Camel exchange properties within custom CXFRS processors. When set to true, this allows for the analysis of the current requests using the JAX-RS API. Activating this option can prove advantageous when developing complex integration scenarios requiring thorough examination of request data in a JAX-RS environment.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel cxfrs component''s loggingFeatureEnabled option, its default value, and whether it is required or optional when using this component? Additionally, in which group of options does this loggingFeatureEnabled option fall under for the cxfrs component?'
      answer: |
       'The "loggingFeatureEnabled" option within the Apache Camel cxf component is designed to enable/disable the CXF Logging Feature. This feature logs inbound and outbound REST messages, helping you analyze and debug your application''s interactions efficiently. By default, this option is disabled (defaultValue: false). It is an optional setting (required: false) under the "logging" group of options for the cxfrs component.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the Apache Camel cxfrs component''s "loggingSizeLimit" option, which is used to set a limit on the total size of bytes logged by the logger when feature has been enabled, and can be configured as -1 for no limit? Additionally, is it required when configuring the component, and if so, in which logging group does this option belong?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel cxfrs component''s "loggingSizeLimit" option has a default value of 49152 (a positive integer), meaning that when logging is enabled, it sets a limit of 49152 bytes on the total size of logged data before cutting off further output. This limit can be configured to -1 for no limitation. The data type for this option is "integer". It is not required when configuring the component and belongs to the "logging" group in the configuration.'
