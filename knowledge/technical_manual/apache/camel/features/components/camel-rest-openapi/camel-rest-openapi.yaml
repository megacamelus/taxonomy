seed_examples:
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `basePath` option within the Apache Camel''s REST-OpenAPI component, what is its default value, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The `basePath` option in Apache Camel''s REST-OpenAPI component serves as the API base path, typically representing a version (for example, /v2). Its default value is not set, meaning it will default to being unset. However, you can override its value if necessary, which will replace any existing value specified in the OpenApi specification. When using this component, the `basePath` option is optional and not strictly required for operation.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "specificationUri" option when using the Apache Camel rest-openapi component, and can it be overridden at the endpoint level if provided or what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "specificationUri" option in the Apache Camel rest-openapi component defines the path to your OpenAPI specification file. This path determines the scheme, host base path of your API. However, these can be overridden at the component or endpoint level if necessary. If no specific path is given, it defaults to ''openapi.json''. It''s important to note that when defining the host on the component and endpoint of this Component, it should follow the URI syntax, including the scheme (e.g., https://), hostname, and optionally the port number. The "specificationUri" value can be overridden at the endpoint configuration level if desired.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of setting the "apiContextPath" option when using the Apache Camel rest-openapi component, and what is its default value if not specified?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "apiContextPath" option in the Apache Camel `rest-openapi` component allows you to specify a custom context path for serving the OpenAPI specification. If this option is not set, it has no default value; meaning its value must be explicitly provided by the user during configuration.'
    - question: 'Here is a question that could be asked based on the provided information about the Apache Camel component `rest-openapi` and its `bridgeErrorHandler` option:              "In the context of using the Apache Camel `rest-openapi` component, what are the differences between setting the `bridgeErrorHandler` option to true and leaving it as its default value (false), when dealing with exceptions that might occur during message processing by the consumer?"'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `bridgeErrorHandler` option to true in the Apache Camel `rest-openapi` component allows for exceptions during message processing by the consumer to be processed as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler. When this option is false (its default value), any exceptions will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored, with the consumer using its internal ExceptionHandler. The key difference is that with `bridgeErrorHandler` set to true, exceptions can be managed more dynamically within the Camel routing structure, potentially improving error handling and recovery in your application.'
    - question: 'Given that the Apache Camel component `rest-openapi` option named `clientRequestValidation` is a boolean value that determines whether client requests will be validated based on an OpenAPI specification, and this validation can be optional, here''s a suitable question:              "What does the Apache Camel rest-openapi configuration setting ''clientRequestValidation'' do when set to true for the consumer group, and how might you know if it requires additional setup or dependencies?"'
      answer: |
       'When you set the ''clientRequestValidation'' option for the ''consumer'' group in the Apache Camel ''rest-openapi'' component to true, it enables validation of the incoming client requests according to the provided OpenAPI specification. This means that the requests will be checked against the defined schema and rules within your API description, ensuring they comply with your API contract. However, please note that if you have additional custom validation requirements or dependencies such as specific libraries for data types or complex validations, these might need to be set up accordingly to accommodate these needs.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior for Apache Camel''s rest-openapi "missingOperation" option when it encounters an OpenAPI operation not mapped to a corresponding route, and what are the alternative behaviors that can be chosen?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the "missingOperation" option in Apache Camel''s rest-openapi setup is to cause the consumer to fail when encountering an OpenAPI operation that isn''t mapped to a corresponding route. However, alternatives are available; if set, it can either ignore the operation or return a mock response instead. The group these options belong to is "consumer".'
    - question: 'How do you set the package name to use as a base for classpath scanning of POJO classes when using the binding mode is enabled for JSON or XML, in the Apache Camel REST-OpenAPI component, if the option is not required and has no default value?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel REST-OpenAPI component, to set the package name(s) as a base for classpath scanning of POJO classes when using binding mode for JSON or XML, you can specify the package names in the "bindingPackageScan" option, separated by commas. This configuration is found under the "groups" labeled as "consumer (advanced)", which indicates it''s an optional setting with no default value. So if you want to configure this setting, you would modify it directly in your Camel configuration file accordingly.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "consumerComponentName" option within the Apache Camel''s "rest-openapi" component, and when might it be necessary to set its value in an endpoint configuration? Further, can you explain if there is a default value for this option, and under which group this option falls in Camel''s configuration settings?'
      answer: |
       'The "consumerComponentName" option within Apache Camel''s "rest-openapi" component is utilized to specify the name of the Camel component that will handle the requests. This component must be present in the Camel registry and it should implement the RestOpenApiConsumerFactory service provider interface. In situations where the component is not explicitly set, the CLASSPATH is searched for a single component implementing the RestOpenApiConsumerFactory SPI. It is important to note that this value can be overridden in the endpoint configuration if necessary. This option falls under the "consumer (advanced)" group in Camel''s configuration settings. There is no default value for the "consumerComponentName" option, but its usage allows for a more fine-grained control when working with components that serve REST API requests using Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, acceptable format, optional nature, group association, and possible usage of the "mockIncludePattern" option in the Apache Camel "rest-openapi" component, particularly when filtering mock data from directories using an Ant-style pattern?'
      answer: |
       'The "mockIncludePattern" option in the Apache Camel "rest-openapi" component is designed for inclusive filtering of mock data from directories. It employs an Ant-path style pattern for specifying the inclusion criteria, and multiple patterns can be specified separately using commas. The default value is classpath:camel-mock/** which means all files in the camel-mock directory will be considered by default, though it''s optional to use a specific pattern. This option falls under the advanced consumer group and could be used for fine-tuning mock data selection according to the desired criteria, ultimately simplifying the management of your mock data during testing or development stages.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `restOpenapiProcessorStrategy` option in the Apache Camel `rest-openapi` component, and is it mandatory or can its usage be skipped? Also, where does this option group under within the component''s configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The `restOpenapiProcessorStrategy` option within the Apache Camel `rest-openapi` component allows you to implement a custom strategy for processing Rest DSL requests. This option is not mandatory, and its usage can be skipped if not needed. It falls under the "consumer (advanced)" group within the component''s configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "host" option in the Apache Camel component "rest-openapi", where it directs HTTP requests to and how can its default value be set or overridden if necessary?'
      answer: |
       'The "host" option within the Apache Camel "rest-openapi" component is designed to specify the scheme, hostname, and port for the destination server to which HTTP requests will be directed. This configuration can be set at various levels - endpoint, component, or through the corresponding REST configuration in the Camel Context.              By default, this option has no specific value. However, it can be explicitly set to an appropriate address (e.g., `https://hostname:port`) when required. The "host" option follows a precedence rule whereby a name given to the component (e.g. petstore) will direct the configuration lookup towards the REST configuration associated with that name first, then to the rest-openapi level and eventually the global configuration in the Camel Context if no specific value is found within the OpenApi specification or RestConfiguration.              If you need to override this option''s value for some reason, it can be changed within the endpoint configuration as mentioned above.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of setting the "lazyStartProducer" option to true in the Apache Camel rest-openapi component, and what impact does it have on the startup and processing time of a route?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "lazyStartProducer" option to true in the Apache Camel rest-openapi component allows the producer to be deferred during the initial startup of your application, reducing the chance of a failure during this process. When the first message is processed, the producer will then be created and started, which may take additional time and extend the overall processing duration slightly due to this delay. By using this option, any potential startup issues with the producer can be managed through Camel''s routing error handlers rather than causing the entire route to fail during initialization. This can help ensure a smoother startup experience for your routes in situations where a producer may otherwise cause an issue when starting up.'
    - question: '"What is the purpose, default value, data type, required status, group association, and the option to enable/disable it for the ''requestValidationEnabled'' option within the ''rest-openapi'' component in Apache Camel, if not specified?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''requestValidationEnabled'' option within the ''rest-openapi'' component in Apache Camel is designed to validate requests against the configured OpenAPI specification. By default, it is set to false, meaning request validation is disabled. Its data type is boolean, which means it can only take true or false values. The requirement for this setting is not essential as it has a default value. Lastly, it belongs to the ''producer'' group of options. To enable this feature, you would need to set ''requestValidationEnabled'' to true in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "componentName" option within the Apache Camel''s "rest-openapi" component, and under what conditions can it be overridden in the endpoint configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "componentName" option within Apache Camel''s "rest-openapi" component is a string that specifies the name of the Camel component responsible for handling the requests. By default, it has no specific value (indicated by null in the information provided). This option serves to allow users to choose a particular Camel component from the registry, given that the selected component implements the RestProducerFactory service provider interface.              If no explicit componentName is provided, the CLASSPATH will be searched for a single component implementing RestProducerFactory SPI. However, it can be overridden in the endpoint configuration should users wish to use a specific component or ensure a certain implementation is used. This option falls under the "producer (advanced)" group, indicating that it may be less frequently used and is more applicable for advanced configurations.'
    - question: 'What types of payload can the Apache Camel rest-openapi component, specifically the consumes option, consume when using it as a producer (advanced)? And what happens if this value is not explicitly set?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel rest-openapi component''s ''consumes'' option determines the type of payload your component can consume while operating as a producer (in advanced mode). This can be a single type such as application/json or a combination of types, following the RFC7231 format like application/json, application/xml; q=0.5. The ''q'' value represents the quality factor for choosing this media type when multiple options are presented, with higher numbers indicating stronger preference. If left unspecified, it will not have a default value but can be set or overridden in individual endpoint configurations.'
    - question: 'What type of payload does the Apache Camel REST-OpenAPI "produces" component option produce, when it''s not set by default and a user decides to configure it? And could you also explain under what circumstances this configuration might be necessary or beneficial?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel REST-OpenAPI "produces" component produces a generic type of payload (i.e., a string), but this default value can be overridden by the user for configuring a specific Content-Type, such as application/json according to RFC7231, when needed to set the Content-Type HTTP header in line with your API''s requirements. This configuration may become necessary or beneficial if you want to specify the exact data format or media type of your API response to ensure compatibility with different clients, and for adherence to best practices in web services communication.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel''s "rest-openapi" component, and under what circumstances would it be necessary to disable or enable this feature?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel''s "rest-openapi" component is a boolean setting that determines whether autowiring is enabled. Its default value is true, meaning autowiring is activated by default. This feature facilitates automatic configuration of various components like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc., by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type.              Disabling this feature (by setting "autowiredEnabled" to false) might be necessary when you want to explicitly manage component instances, rather than letting Camel do it automatically. Additionally, disabling autowiring can help avoid potential conflicts or ambiguities that could arise due to multiple instances of a particular type being registered in the registry. However, if you prefer the convenience and time-saving benefits of automatic configuration, keeping the default value (true) is recommended.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the Apache Camel "sslContextParameters" option under the "rest-openapi" component, and can this configuration be considered optional? Furthermore, where are these parameters grouped in terms of the configuration hierarchy for this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "sslContextParameters" option within the "rest-openapi" component in Apache Camel is intended to allow you to customize the TLS parameters used by the component. If not explicitly set, it defaults to the TLS parameters established in the larger Camel context. This configuration is considered optional as indicated by its ''required'' parameter being false. In terms of the configuration hierarchy for this component, these parameters are grouped under the "security" category.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "useGlobalSslContextParameters" option in the Apache Camel''s REST-OpenAPI component under the security group, and is it mandatory to set this option when using the component?'
      answer: |
       'The "useGlobalSslContextParameters" option in Apache Camel''s REST-OpenAPI component, falling under the ''security'' group, enables the use of global SSL context parameters. By default, this option is set to false, meaning that individual SSL context parameters are used instead. However, setting it to true allows you to leverage a common SSL context across your application if desired, which can simplify management and configuration. It is not mandatory to set this option as its use depends on your specific application requirements related to SSL security management.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "apiContextPath" option when using the "rest-openapi" component in Apache Camel, and is it required or optional to specify this value?'
      answer: |
       'The "apiContextPath" option within the "rest-openapi" component of Apache Camel serves to set a specific context path for serving the OpenAPI specification. The default value for this option is null, meaning no predefined context path if not specified. It''s an optional configuration, as indicated by the "required": false in the information provided. This means you can specify it when needed, but it''s not mandatory to provide a value for the apiContextPath.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the `clientRequestValidation` option in the `rest-openapi` component within Apache Camel affect the behavior of a consumer when it receives requests?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the `clientRequestValidation` option in the `rest-openapi` component within Apache Camel allows for validation of incoming client requests against the defined OpenAPI specification. This means that when the consumer receives a request, if the request doesn''t adhere to the specified structure and constraints according to the OpenAPI definition, it will be considered invalid. The consumer will behave differently in this case, potentially returning an error or rejecting the request, as opposed to when the validation is disabled, where such requests might still be processed. However, note that when `clientRequestValidation` is set to false (the default), the component will not perform these checks.'
    - question: 'What types of payload can the Apache Camel "rest-openapi" component consume if the "consumes" option is explicitly set, considering it follows the RFC7231 specification? And could you explain how this value affects the Accept HTTP header and potential overrides in the OpenApi specification and component configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel "rest-openapi" component can consume different payload types, depending on the value specified in the "consumes" option. If following the RFC7231 specification, it could be set to one type like application/json or multiple types separated by semicolons, such as application/json, application/xml; q=0.5. The q-value (in this case 0.5) indicates the quality factor or preference of the content types. In case of multiple options, the most preferred MIME type is chosen based on this value. This equates to the value of the Accept HTTP header. If the "consumes" option is explicitly set, it overrides any previously defined values in both the OpenApi specification and the component configuration. This allows you to specify a more specific or different content type that your application is designed to handle during runtime.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel rest-openapi component''s "missingOperation" option to ignore operations that are not mapped to a corresponding route in the OpenAPI specification, instead of failing?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel `rest-openapi` component''s "missingOperation" option to ignore operations that are not mapped to a corresponding route in the OpenAPI specification instead of failing, set its value to "ignore". The configuration can be updated as follows:              ```json       {         "component": "rest-openapi",         "option": "missingOperation",         "description": "Whether the consumer should ignore or return a mock response for OpenAPI operations that are not mapped to a corresponding route.",         "defaultValue": "fail",         "type": "string",         "required": false,         "groups": "consumer"       }       ```              By changing the value from "fail" to "ignore", Camel will bypass operations that don''t have a corresponding route during runtime without raising an exception.'
    - question: 'How can you enable Apache Camel''s "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the rest-openapi component to allow exceptions from third-party components to be processed as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler, if the 3rd party component permits it?'
      answer: |
       'To enable Apache Camel''s "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the rest-openapi component, you should configure it with the value "true". This will allow exceptions from third-party components to be processed as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler, assuming the third-party component allows for such notifications. Keep in mind that not all components support this functionality, and some handle exceptions internally only. The default behavior is to use org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, which are logged at WARN or ERROR level and then ignored if the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is not enabled. This setting can be found in the "consumer (advanced)" group of configurations.'
    - question: 'What should be the name of a Camel component that will service REST OpenAPI requests if we don''t set the `consumerComponentName` option and want to use the default value? And under what circumstances might a specific component name need to be provided for this option?'
      answer: |
       'If you don''t set the `consumerComponentName` option for the Camel component that will service REST OpenAPI requests, the CLASSPATH will be searched for a single component implementing the RestOpenApiConsumerFactory SPI. However, if multiple components implement this interface, no default value is provided and a specific component name must be provided for the `consumerComponentName` option. The naming of the component should follow common Camel component naming conventions and it must be present in the Camel registry.'
    - question: 'What is the function of the exceptionHandler option in the Apache Camel rest-openapi component, when the bridgeErrorHandler is disabled, and whether it has a default value or not?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel rest-openapi component, the "exceptionHandler" option allows consumers to use a custom ExceptionHandler. If the "bridgeErrorHandler" is disabled, this option becomes functional. By default, exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level are handled by the consumer and ignored without an ExceptionHandler. However, when using a custom ExceptionHandler, consumers can manage exceptions as per their requirements. There is no default value for the exceptionHandler option in the consumer (advanced) group settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of setting the `exchangePattern` option in the Apache Camel component "rest-openapi" and what are the default and possible values for this option, as well as where it falls in terms of required options when using a consumer?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s "rest-openapi" component, setting the `exchangePattern` option allows you to configure the type of interaction between the consumer and the service provider during an exchange (i.e., communication). This option is particularly useful for advanced consumers who are dealing with more complex REST API scenarios. The default value for this option is null, which implies that it''s not set explicitly. As for possible values, they can vary based on the specific use case but commonly include "InOut", "InOnly", and "OutOnly". It''s important to note that using the `exchangePattern` option is an optional feature in the consumer context.'
    - question: 'Given the information you''ve provided, here''s a question that can be answered with the provided details for someone learning about Apache Camel components:              "What is the purpose and usage of the `mockIncludePattern` option in the ''rest-openapi'' component of Apache Camel, and what is its default value and group?"'
      answer: |
       'The `mockIncludePattern` option within the ''rest-openapi'' component of Apache Camel is used for inclusive filtering of mock data from directories. This pattern follows Ant-style path patterns. You can specify multiple patterns, separating them by commas. Its default value is classpath:camel-mock/**. This setting belongs to the advanced group named "consumer".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "restOpenapiProcessorStrategy" option in the Apache Camel component "rest-openapi", and does it have a default value, as well as which group of Camel configurations is it associated with (if any)?'
      answer: |
       'The "restOpenapiProcessorStrategy" option in the Apache Camel "rest-openapi" component allows you to utilize a custom strategy for processing Rest DSL (Domain Specific Language) requests. It does not have a default value. This configuration is associated with the "consumer (advanced)" group of Camel configurations, indicating it is designed for more advanced usage scenarios.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, group association (if any), and required nature of the "basePath" option within the Apache Camel''s REST OpenAPI component?'
      answer: |
       'The "basePath" option within Apache Camel''s REST OpenAPI component is a configurable parameter for setting the base URL path for your API. By default, it doesn''t have a value (defaultValue: null). However, you can override any value present in the OpenApi specification or within the component configuration itself if necessary. The data type of this option is a string, and it is not a required parameter (required: false). This option is associated with the ''producer'' group of configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "host" option within the Apache Camel component named "rest-openapi", and under what circumstances does this value override the values found in the OpenApi specification, RestConfiguration, or other configuration settings?'
      answer: |
       'The "host" option within the Apache Camel component named "rest-openapi" is a string type that serves to specify the scheme hostname and port to direct HTTP requests. It can be configured at various levels such as endpoint, component, or in the corresponding REST configuration within the Camel Context.              The default value for this option is null. When set, it overrides any values found in the OpenApi specification, RestConfiguration, and other configuration settings. This means that if you explicitly provide a "host" value at any of these levels, it will take precedence over the defaults or previously specified values.              This comes into play when you want to manually specify the server URL for your REST API calls, providing greater control and flexibility in how and where your requests are directed.'
    - question: 'What is the default data type or value for the "produces" option when using the Apache Camel component "rest-openapi", and is it optional? Also, where in the OpenAPI specification would one find this property if it was not overridden?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "produces" option when using the Apache Camel component "rest-openapi" is null, meaning that there is no predefined data type or Content-Type specified. It''s optional since the field "required" in the given information is false. If this property is not overridden in your OpenAPI specification, you would not find it explicitly declared as it gets automatically derived based on the response structure of your API.'
    - question: '"In what scenario or when is it beneficial to set the ''requestValidationEnabled'' option to true for the Apache Camel REST-OpenAPI component, and is it required for use?"'
      answer: |
       'It would be advantageous to set the ''requestValidationEnabled'' option to true for the Apache Camel REST-OpenAPI component when you want to ensure that incoming requests adhere to the specified OpenAPI contract. This can help maintain a consistent structure and format in your API, improve client interaction, and prevent potential runtime errors due to invalid request formats. However, setting this option to true is not required; its use is optional within producer groups, allowing flexibility for your specific integration needs.'
    - question: 'What should be the value of the "componentName" option in Apache Camel''s rest-openapi component to explicitly specify a custom Camel component that implements the RestProducerFactory service provider interface, if it is already present in the Camel registry? If not provided, will Apache Camel automatically search for a single component in the CLASSPATH that implements RestProducerFactory SPI?'
      answer: |
       'To explicitly specify a custom Camel component that implements the RestProducerFactory service provider interface in Apache Camel''s rest-openapi component, you should set the value of the "componentName" option to the name of your custom component. If the specified component is already present in the Camel registry, it will be used.              If the "componentName" option is not provided, Apache Camel will automatically search for a single component in the CLASSPATH that implements RestProducerFactory SPI.'
    - question: 'Here''s a possible question based on the provided information:              "What is the purpose and function of the ''lazyStartProducer'' option in Apache Camel''s REST-OpenAPI component, and what are the benefits and drawbacks associated with enabling this feature?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''lazyStartProducer'' option in Apache Camel''s REST-OpenAPI component is designed to control whether the producer should be started lazily (on the first message). This can be particularly useful in scenarios where a producer might otherwise fail during the start-up of the CamelContext or routes, causing the entire process to fail. By allowing the producer to start lazily, such startup failures can instead be handled via Camel''s routing error handlers during messaging.              However, enabling lazy start for the producer comes with a trade-off. Since the creating and starting of the producer may occur when the first message is processed, this could prolong the overall processing time due to the extra time required to set up the producer. Nonetheless, this delay allows for more flexibility in handling potential issues that might arise during production setup. This option falls under the ''producer (advanced)'' group in Camel''s configuration options.'
