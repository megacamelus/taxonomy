    - question: 'What are the valid usage scenarios and examples for setting additional properties in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component, specifically for adding Kafka Connect properties required by Debezium engine such as setting Kafka Offset Backing Store or Schema Registry URL? How can we set these properties using the "additionalProperties" option?'
      answer: |
       'In using the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component, the "additionalProperties" option provides a method to configure Debezium-specific settings that cannot be directly set on Camel configurations. This is particularly useful for setting Kafka Connect properties required by the Debezium engine, such as configuring the Kafka Offset Backing Store or Schema Registry URL.              For instance, to set the Kafka Offset Backing Store, you can use the following syntax: `additionalProperties.transactional.id=12345`. This sets the transactional id for the Offset Backing Store.              Similarly, to configure the Schema Registry URL, you can use: `additionalProperties.schema.registry.url=http://localhost:8811/avro`. This sets the URL of your Avro Schema Registry.              These properties need to be prefixed with "additionalProperties" when setting them within your Camel configuration.'
    - question: 'Can you explain how to enable the bridgeErrorHandler option for the debezium-oracle component in Apache Camel to allow exceptions thrown by the component to be processed as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler, rather than being logged and ignored by default? Is it necessary for the 3rd party component (in this case, Debezium-Oracle) to explicitly support this feature, or is there a way to modify Camel to make this possible for future releases?'
      answer: |
       'To enable the bridgeErrorHandler option for the debezium-org component in Apache Camel, you can configure it as follows:              ```xml       <debeziumConsumer id="myDebeziumConsumer" ... bridgeErrorHandler="true">           <!-- other configuration -->       </debeziumConsumer>       ```              Note that by default, this option is set to false. Enabling it will cause exceptions thrown by the debezium-oracle component to be processed as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler instead of being logged and ignored by default.              It is essential for the 3rd party component (in this case, Debezium-Oracle) to explicitly support the bridgeErrorHandler feature for it to work correctly. If the component does not natively support this functionality, it may be possible to modify Camel in future releases to hook into the 3rd party component and make this possible. Until then, the consumer will use its default exception handler to deal with exceptions if the bridgeErrorHandler option is not explicitly set.'
    - question: 'What are the possible configurations that can be set in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component if the user chooses not to specify them? Is there a default configuration provided for this component, and if so, what is it comprised of (i.e., grouped under which consumer settings)?'
      answer: |
       'If you choose not to explicitly set configurations for the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component, no pre-configured settings will be applied by default. The provided configuration object allows you to specify custom settings if desired. The default value is null, indicating there are no default configurations. The settings related to this component can be found under the "consumer" group in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "internalKeyConverter" option in the Apache Camel''s Debezium-Oracle component, and what is its default value if not explicitly specified? Also, under which group does this option belong and is it required to be set when configuring the component?'
      answer: |
       'The "internalKeyConverter" option in the Apache Camel''s Debezium-Oracle component is employed for serializing and deserializing key data used for offsets. By default, the JSON converter (org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter) is utilized. This option does not have to be set explicitly as it belongs to the consumer group, though its configuration is optional when configuring the component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "internalValueConverter" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component, and what Converter class should be used if a custom serialization/deserialization method is desired for offset data storage, considering that the default value is org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter?'
      answer: |
       'The "internalValueConverter" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component serves to specify a Converter class for serializing and deserializing value data associated with offsets during replication processes. If you wish to use a custom serialization/deserialization method, any Converter class can be used, replacing the default org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter. The choice of Converter is optional, but when unspecified, it defaults to using JSON conversion.'
    - question: 'Given the information provided, here''s a question that can be answered using this data:              What is the purpose and default value of the offsetCommitPolicy option in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component, and what type of class should it implement? Also, is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The `offsetCommitPolicy` option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component is used to configure the commit policy that defines when offsets commit are triggered based on the number of events processed and the time elapsed since the last commit. This class must implement the OffsetCommitPolicy interface. The default value for this option is null, indicating a periodic commit policy based upon time intervals. It''s not mandatory to provide a value for this option as it has a default implementation provided by Debezium.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum time, in milliseconds, that the debezium-oracle component for Apache Camel will wait for records to flush and offset data to be committed to offset storage before cancelling a process, as specified by the offsetCommitTimeoutMs option? Additionally, what is the default value for this timeout period?'
      answer: |
       'The maximum time that the debezium-oracle component for Apache Camel will wait for records to flush and offset data to be committed to offset storage before cancelling a process is specified by the option ''offsetCommitTimeoutMs''. This value can be set in milliseconds, and the maximum duration defined for this option is not explicitly stated in the information provided. However, it''s worth noting that the default value for this timeout period is 5000 milliseconds, or 5 seconds.'
    - question: 'What is the default duration (in milliseconds) for the debezium-oracle component''s offsetFlushIntervalMs option in Apache Camel when it is not explicitly set, and which group of options does this setting belong to in terms of its functionality?'
      answer: |
       'The default duration for the `offsetFlushIntervalMs` option within the `debezium-oracle` component in Apache Camel is 60,000 milliseconds (or 1 minute) when it is not explicitly set. This setting belongs to the "consumer" group of options, as it pertains to handling and managing offsets in consumer components.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the optional configuration parameter "offsetStorage" in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle", and can this parameter be set to a custom Java class for persisting connector offsets?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional configuration parameter "offsetStorage" in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" is of type string, specifically `org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.FileOffsetBackingStore`. However, it can be set to a custom Java class for persisting connector offsets if desired. This parameter falls under the group "consumer".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "offsetStorageFileName" option in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component, and what value should it be assigned when using the FileOffsetBackingStore for offset storage?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageFileName" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component is used to specify the path where offsets are stored when the offset.storage is set to the FileOffsetBackingStore. This value should be assigned a string that points to the desired file location for the offset storage. However, it''s important to note that this option is not mandatory; its use is optional within the consumer group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "offsetStoragePartitions" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component, and is it required when using the offset.storage set to the ''KafkaOffsetBackingStore''?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStoragePartitions" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component determines the number of partitions used when creating the offset storage topic. This option is optional but required when the offset.storage is set to the ''KafkaOffsetBackingStore''. By default, it does not have a value you need to specify explicitly if you choose to use it.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "offsetStorageReplicationFactor" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component, and is it required when using offset.storage with KafkaOffsetBackingStore?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageReplicationFactor" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component is used to specify the replication factor when creating the offset storage topic. This is relevant only when you set your offset.storage to the KafkaOffsetBackingStore. It''s an optional setting, as indicated by its default value being null. When not explicitly provided, it won''t be applied in the configuration. In terms of groups, this option falls under the "consumer" category.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "offsetStorageTopic" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component, and is it required or optional? (Hint: It''s related to Kafka offset storage when offset.storage is set to the KafkaOffsetBackingStore.)'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageTopic" option within the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component pertains to the naming of a Kafka topic, which serves as the storage location for offsets when the offset.storage is configured as the KafkaOffsetBackingStore. While not required, setting this option allows you to specify a custom topic for storing and retrieving Kafka consumer offsets. The default value for this option is null, meaning one will need to provide a string value if using a specific topic for offset storage.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component, and can it be configured as optional? (Hint: It enables automatic autowiring of options and is used for configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients etc.)'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component is a boolean setting that determines whether automatic autowiring of options is enabled. Its default value is true, meaning that it is enabled by default. This feature helps to automatically configure components like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, etc., by looking up in the registry to find if there''s a single instance of matching type. If you don''t need this automatic configuration and prefer manual configuration, you can set "autowiredEnabled" to false. This option falls under the advanced group of configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''archiveDestinationName'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-oracle'', and how can it be configured if a specific archive log destination is to be used as the source for reading archive logs? Also, what happens when this option is not set?'
      answer: |
       'The ''archiveDestinationName'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-oracle'' serves the purpose of setting a specific archive log destination as the source for reading archive logs. If you wish to use a particular archive log destination explicitly, you can configure this option with the desired name.              When this option is not set, the connector will automatically choose the first LOCAL and VALID archive log destination available. In other words, if no specific destination is specified, it defaults to the first one that meets these criteria.              Keep in mind that this option expects a string value, as indicated by its type being "string." It''s also important to note that while using this option is not mandatory, as it has a default value of null and can be omitted if desired, it may provide more control over the source of archive logs when needed.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "archiveLogHours" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle", and what range of values can be set for this option to mine only specific archive logs from the past?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "archiveLogHours" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" is 0, which means it mines all available archive logs. However, you can set a range of positive integer values for this option to mine only specific archive logs from the past. For instance, if you set it to 12, it will mine archive logs that are within the last 12 hours from the current system date (SYSDATE).'
    - question: 'What are the available options for representing binary (blob, binary, etc.) columns in Apache Camel''s Debezium Oracle component when using the ''binaryHandlingMode'' option? And what is the default value and which groups does this option belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The available options for representing binary (blob, binary, etc.) columns in Apache Camel''s Debezium Oracle component when using the ''binaryHandlingMode'' option are:       1. bytes (Default): Represents binary data as byte array.       2. base64: Represents binary data as base64-encoded string.       3. base64-url-safe: Represents binary data as base64-url-safe-encoded string.       4. hex: Represents binary data as hex-encoded (base16) string.       The default value is ''bytes''. This option belongs to the ''oracle'' group.'
    - question: 'What is the function and purpose of the "columnExcludeList" option within the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle", and what type of data should it accept when specified?'
      answer: |
       'The "columnExcludeList" option within the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" serves to define regular expressions that match columns to be excluded from change events. This means that if you specify a list of regex patterns for this option, only changes in the database table rows excluding the specified columns will trigger an event. The data type it accepts when specified is "string".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "columnIncludeList" option within the Apache Camel''s Debezium-Oracle component, and what type of data can it accept? Additionally, is the use of this option mandatory when using this component, and if not, does it have a default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "columnIncludeList" option within Apache Camel''s Debezium-Oracle component serves to specify regular expressions that match columns to include in change events. This means you can selectively include specific columns in your data streams instead of all columns from the database table. The type of data it accepts is strings representing regular expressions.              Using this option is not mandatory; if it''s not provided, no columns will be explicitly included in the change events (though all columns will still be captured by default). However, in cases where you wish to filter or select specific columns, you can provide a list of regular expressions for the "columnIncludeList" option.'
    - question: 'How should the value of the "columnPropagateSourceType" option in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component be formatted when we want to include column original type and length as parameters in the emitted change records, and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The value of the "columnPropagateSourceType" option in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component should be formatted as a comma-separated list of regular expressions matching fully-qualified names of columns. This format allows the inclusion of column original type and length as parameters in the emitted change records. However, please note that the default value for this option is null.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "converters" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-oracle" component, and how can custom converters be defined and configured when using this option? Additionally, is it mandatory to use custom converters with the debezium-oracle component, and what is the default value for the "converters" option?'
      answer: |
       'The "converters" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-oracle" component allows you to use optional, custom converters instead of the default ones provided by the component. You can define these custom converters using the ''.type'' config option and configure them with other options ''.''. Custom converters are useful when you want to transform the data in a specific way that is not handled by the default converters. However, using custom converters is not mandatory; the default value for the "converters" option is null.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "customMetricTags" option in the Apache Camel''s debezium-oracle component, and how can you configure it to append custom tags to the MBean object name?'
      answer: |
       'The "customMetricTags" option in the Apache Camel''s Debezium-Oracle component serves to customize the Management Bean (MBean) object name by appending additional information, or tags, to the regular name. Each tag consists of a key-value pair, where the key is a designator for a specific attribute and its corresponding value is the desired value for that attribute. For instance, in the format "k1=v1,k2=v2", k1 and v1, as well as k2 and v2 are key-value pairs for separate tags. This feature allows for flexible labeling of your MBean objects based on specific attributes or parameters you wish to highlight. It''s worth noting that the use of this option is optional, with no default value provided.'
    - question: 'What are the available options for the ''databaseConnectionAdapter'' option in the Apache Camel''s debezium-oracle component, and what is the default value for this setting?'
      answer: |
       'The ''databaseConnectionAdapter'' option in Apache Camel''s debezium-oracle component provides two main choices: ''logminer'' (the default) to capture changes using Oracle LogMiner, or ''xstream'' to capture changes using Oracle XStreams. You can adjust this setting according to your specific use case, but keep in mind that the default value is ''LogMiner''.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "databaseDbname" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle"? Also, is it mandatory to provide a value for this option when configuring the connector?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseDbname" option within the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" specifies the name of the database from which the connector should capture changes. It is not mandatory to provide a value for this option, as it has a default value of null. This means that if no specific database is defined, the connector will not be configured to capture changes from any database by default. However, you can set a string value for this option when configuring the connector in order to specify the database from which you want to capture changes.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "databaseHostname" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle", and is it a required field?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseHostname" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" specifies the resolvable hostname or IP address of the database server. It''s not mandatory to provide this value as its default is null. This field is part of the "oracle" group, meaning it''s particularly relevant when configuring a connection to an Oracle database using Debezium.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the "databaseOutServerName" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component, and is it a required configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseOutServerName" option within the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component is used to specify the name of the XStream Out server to connect to. This value is optional as denoted by the "required": false, meaning that providing it is not necessary for the configuration. Regarding its default value, it is set to null.'
    - question: 'What is the required, string type password that should be provided for the ''debezium-oracle'' component in Apache Camel when connecting to an Oracle database?'
      answer: |
       'The required string type password that should be provided for the ''debezium-oracle'' component in Apache Camel when connecting to an Oracle database is the password of the database user. This can be set under the "databasePassword" option.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the "databasePdbName" option when using the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component in a multi-tenant setup, and is it required for configuration?'
      answer: |
       'In a multi-tenant setup with Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle, the "databasePdbName" option specifies the name of the pluggable database. Even though it''s not mandatory, you may provide it for better configuration. The CDB (Container Database) name should be set via the `database.dbname` property in such a scenario. Regarding default value, there is none explicitly defined for "databasePdbName".'
    - question: 'What is the default port number for the debezium-oracle component''s "databasePort" option in Apache Camel, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option? (Answer: The default value is 1528, and it is not mandatory to provide a value.)'
      answer: |
       'In regards to your question, the default port number for the "databasePort" option in the debezium-oracle component of Apache Camel is 1528. It''s important to note that providing a value for this option is not mandatory.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and maximum duration limit for the debezium-oracle component''s "databaseQueryTimeoutMs" option in Apache Camel, and can it be set to zero?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "databaseQueryTimeoutMs" option in the "debezium-oracle" component of Apache Camel is 10 minutes (10m). Regarding the maximum duration limit, there is no explicitly stated upper bound; however, zero can be used to indicate an absence of a timeout limit.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "databaseUrl" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle", and what format should it follow to correctly specify a complete JDBC URL for alternative connection scenarios?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseUrl" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" serves as an alternative way to provide a Complete JDBC URL, which allows you to configure hostname, port, and database details in a single string. This is particularly useful for supporting various connection scenarios where alternative methods of specifying these parameters are beneficial. The format for the "databaseUrl" should follow standard JDBC URL syntax, including protocol (e.g., jdbc:oracle:thin@), hostname, port number, service name or SID, and other optional parameters such as authentication information.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "databaseUser" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-oracle" component, and is it required for connection?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseUser" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-oracle" component serves the purpose of specifying the name of the database user to be utilized when establishing a connection to the Oracle database. However, it is not mandatory as its default value is null. This means you have the flexibility to provide your own database user or use the system''s default if none is explicitly specified.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the `datatypePropagateSourceType` option within the Apache Camel `debezium-oracle` component to propagate specific Oracle database data types and their original lengths as parameters in the emitted change records, using regular expressions?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the `datatypePropagateSourceType` option within the Apache Camel `debezium-oracle` component to propagate specific Oracle database data types and their original lengths as parameters in the emitted change records using regular expressions, you should set the value of this option to a comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the desired database-specific data type names. For example:              ```       datatypePropagateSourceType= "^NUMBER\$, ^DATE\$"       ```              In this case, the regular expression `^NUMBER\$` matches any Oracle data types starting with ''NUMBER'', while the regular expression `^DATE\$` matches any data types starting with ''DATE''. By setting this option, the original data type and length of these specific data types will be added as parameters to the corresponding field schemas in the emitted change records.'
    - question: 'What are the possible values for the "decimalHandlingMode" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component and what does each value mean regarding how DECIMAL and NUMERIC columns are represented in change events?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component, the "decimalHandlingMode" option has three possible values: ''precise'' (default), ''string'', and ''double''.              1. ''precise'': This is the default value. It uses java.math.BigDecimal to represent DECIMAL and NUMERIC column values in change events. These values are encoded using a binary representation and Kafka Connect''s ''org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Decimal'' type, offering high precision.              2. ''string'': In this mode, the values of DECIMAL and NUMERIC columns are represented as strings in change events. This may not offer the same level of precision but can be easier to use in some consumer applications.              3. ''double'': Representing values using Java''s ''double'' type is the third option. While this may not provide the same precision as ''precise'' or ''string'', it will be simpler to handle in many consumer applications due to its ease of use and compatibility with double data types.'
    - question: 'How many retries on connection errors does the debezium-oracle component in Apache Camel allow before it fails by default, and what is the data type for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The Debezium-Oracle component in Apache Camel allows an unlimited number of retries on connection errors by default, as its default value for the "errorsMaxRetries" option is -1 (meaning no limit). The data type for this option is integer.'
    - question: '"What are the available options for handling failure during processing of events in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-oracle'', and what is the default value for the option named ''eventProcessingFailureHandlingMode''?"'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel component ''debezium-oracle'' provides three options for handling failures during processing of events: ''fail'' (the default), ''warn'', and ''ignore''. When set to ''fail'', an exception will be raised if a corrupted event is encountered, causing the connector to stop. If set to ''warn'', the problematic event and its position will be logged, and the event will be skipped without raising an exception. Lastly, when set to ''ignore'', the problematic event will simply be skipped without any logging or exceptions being raised. The default value for the option named ''eventProcessingFailureHandlingMode'' is ''fail''.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "heartbeatActionQuery" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component, and what is its default value and data type? Also, is it a required option or can it be omitted when configuring this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "heartbeatActionQuery" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component serves the purpose of specifying the SQL query that will be executed with every heartbeat. Its default value is null, indicating that no specific query is set by default. This option is of type string, meaning it can contain textual data. It''s not a required option, which means it can be omitted when configuring this component if desired.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "heartbeatIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component, and can it be configured to send heartbeats periodically?'
      answer: |
       'The "heartbeatIntervalMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component is a duration type that sets the interval in milliseconds for the connector to periodically send heartbeat messages to a heartbeat topic. By default, this option is disabled (with a default value of 0ms), meaning no heartbeats are sent. However, you can configure it to send heartbeats periodically if needed, within your Oracle group settings in the configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "heartbeatTopicsPrefix" option in the Apache Camel Oracle Debezium component, and is it required when configuring this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "heartbeatTopicsPrefix" option in the Apache Camel Oracle Debezium component is "__debezium-heartbeat". This option specifies the prefix that is used to name heartbeat topics, and it defaults to "__debezium-heartbeat". The data type of this option is a string. It''s worth noting that this option is not required when configuring this component.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and whether it''s mandatory to use the ''includeSchemaChanges'' option in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component when using this option will the connector publish changes in the database schema to a Kafka topic?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the ''includeSchemaChanges'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component is true. This means that the connector will publish changes in the database schema to a Kafka topic with the same name as the database server ID by default. If you choose to use this option, each schema change will be recorded using a key containing the database name and its value will include the logical description of the new schema and optionally the DDL statements. However, it is not mandatory to use this option as it has a false value as well.'
    - question: 'Here''s a question that can be answered with the given information:              "What is the default value for the option ''includeSchemaComments'' in Apache Camel''s debezium-oracle component, and what impact does enabling this option have on memory usage?"'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the option ''includeSchemaComments'' in Apache Camel''s debezium-oracle component is false. Enabling this option may have an impact on memory usage as it can potentially increase the number and size of ColumnImpl objects, which largely impacts the memory consumption by Debezium connectors. Adding a String to each of these objects can be quite heavy.'
    - question: 'What are the available options for the incrementalSnapshotWatermarkingStrategy in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component, and how does each option affect the signal data collection during an incremental snapshot?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component, you have two options for the incrementalSnapshotWatermarkingStrategy: ''insert_insert'' and ''insert_delete''. The default value is ''insert_insert''.              The ''insert_insert'' strategy writes both open and close signals into the signal data collection. This means that during an incremental snapshot, both the start (open) and end (close) events for each change are recorded in the signal data collection.              On the other hand, the ''insert_delete'' strategy only records the open signal on the signal data collection. The close event will not be written directly into the data collection; instead, it will delete the corresponding open signal from the collection at a later time. This approach can help reduce the amount of data stored in the signal data collection during an incremental snapshot.              In summary, the choice between ''insert_insert'' and ''insert_delete'' affects how signals are handled in the signal data collection during an incremental snapshot, with each strategy offering different trade-offs related to data storage and management within your Oracle database.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the option `intervalHandlingMode` in the Apache Camel component named `debezium-oracle`, and what are the two possible values it can take, and what do they represent in terms of how INTERVAL columns are handled in change events?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the option `intervalHandlingMode` in the Apache Camel component named `debezium-oracle` is ''numeric''. This option specifies how INTERVAL columns should be represented in change events. The two possible values it can take are ''string'' and ''numeric'' (default).

    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "lobEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle", and what happens when it''s set to both ''true'' and its default value ''false''?'
      answer: |
       'The "lobEnabled" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" is used to control the capture and emission of Large Object (LOB) fields during data changes. When set to ''false'', which is its default value, LOB fields will not be captured or emitted. This means that these types of data will be ignored during data synchronization. On the other hand, when set to ''true'', the connector will capture and emit changes for LOB fields just like any other column type. This allows for the inclusion of large object data in the changed data captured by the connector.'
    - question: 'How does setting the `logMiningArchiveLogOnlyMode` option to ''true'' in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component affect the behavior of the connector, and under what circumstances might it be beneficial to use this configuration, accepting potential latency in event emission?'
      answer: |
       'Setting `logMiningArchiveLogOnlyMode` to ''true'' in the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component changes the behavior of the connector so that it only mines archive logs for change events.

    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the option "schemaHistoryInternalSkipUnparseableDdl" in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component affect its behavior when it encounters unparseable DDL statements during data extraction from an Oracle database, and what are the potential implications of each setting on metadata changes?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the option "schemaHistoryInternalSkipUnparseableDdl" in the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component allows it to ignore unparseable DDL statements during data extraction from an Oracle database, rather than stopping operation as it does by default. However, if skipping is enabled, Debezium may miss metadata changes since it skips over DDL statements that it cannot parse. On the other hand, disabling this option means that the connector will stop operating when encountering such unparseable DDL statements, ensuring all metadata changes are accounted for at the cost of potential interruptions in data flow.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "schemaHistoryInternalStoreOnlyCapturedDatabasesDdl" option in the Apache Camel''s debezium-oracle component, and can it be set to false without being required?'
      answer: |
       'The "schemaHistoryInternalStoreOnlyCapturedDatabasesDdl" option in the Apache Camel''s debezium-oracle component controls what Data Definition Language (DDL) statements Debezium stores in the database schema history. By default, it is set to true, meaning only DDL that manipulates a table from captured schemas/databases will be stored. If you set it to false, Debezium will store all incoming DDL statements. However, setting it to false is not required.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "schemaHistoryInternalStoreOnlyCapturedTablesDdl" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle", and can it be considered as a required configuration option?'
      answer: |
       'The "schemaHistoryInternalStoreOnlyCapturedTablesDdl" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" primarily controls what Data Definition Language (DDL) statements will be stored in the database schema history by Debezium. By default, it is set to false, meaning that all incoming DDL statements are stored. However, if you set it to true, only DDL operations that manipulate a captured table will be stored. Although this option is not required, it can be used to manage the amount of DDL information stored in your database schema history.'
    - question: 'What are the available options for adjusting schema names when using the ''debezium-oracle'' component in Apache Camel, and how do each of these modes handle character replacement to ensure compatibility with the message converter used by the connector?

      answer: |
       'To specify a list of tables/collections for which a snapshot should be taken during creation or restart of the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component, if you wish to use the "snapshotIncludeCollectionList" option (though it''s not required), you can set this option to a string containing comma-separated table/collection names. For instance, for taking snapshots of tables ''table1'', ''table2'', and ''table3'', you would set the option as follows: "snapshotIncludeCollectionList=table1,table2,table3".'
    - question: 'How does setting the `snapshotLockingMode` option in the Apache Camel''s debezium-oracle component to ''none'' affect the behavior of the connector during schema snapshot and why is it only safe to use when no schema changes are happening while the snapshot is taken?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `snapshotLockingMode` option in Apache Camel''s debezium-oracle component to ''none'' means the connector will not hold any locks on tables during the schema snapshot. This can be beneficial if you want to avoid locks entirely, but it''s important to note that this mode is only safe to use when no schema changes are happening while the snapshot is taken. In the ''none'' mode, the connector does not prevent exclusive table access, which could lead to inconsistent data if any schema modifications occur during the snapshot process. Instead, the remaining work in a snapshot is done using a flashback query that requires no locks, making it less resource-intensive for read operations. However, be aware that this approach can have implications on the stability and reliability of your data syncing process, so it should only be employed under appropriate circumstances.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and maximum duration for the "snapshotLockTimeoutMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component, and is it required? Furthermore, can you explain what this option does in the context of the component''s functionality?'
      answer: |
       'The "snapshotLockTimeoutMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component has a default value of 10 seconds (10s). This option sets the maximum number of milliseconds to wait for table locks at the beginning of a snapshot. If the component cannot acquire these locks within this time frame, the snapshot will be aborted. This option is not required, meaning it can be omitted from your configuration if desired. The purpose of this setting is to prevent the component from waiting indefinitely when trying to acquire table locks, ensuring that the snapshots are taken efficiently and reliably.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and maximum allowable range for the "snapshotMaxThreads" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component, and is it required when using this component?'

    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the snapshotMode option in Apache Camel''s debezium-oracle component, and what are the available options for configuring this feature, including their respective effects on the connector''s functionality?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the `snapshotMode` option in Apache Camel''s `debezium-oracle` component is ''initial''. This means that if the connector does not find any offsets for the logical server name, it will run a snapshot capturing the current full state of the configured tables. After the snapshot completes, the connector begins to stream changes from the redo logs.              You can configure this feature with several options:              1. ''always'': The connector runs a snapshot every time that it starts. After the snapshot completes, the connector begins to stream changes from the redo logs.       2. ''initial_only'': The connector performs a snapshot as it does for the ''initial'' option, but after the connector completes the snapshot, it stops and does not stream changes from the redo logs.       3. ''schema_only'': If the connector does not find any offsets for the logical server name, it runs a snapshot that captures only the schema (table structures), but not any table data. After the snapshot completes, the connector begins to stream changes from the redo logs.       4. ''schema_only_recovery'': The connector performs a snapshot that captures only the database schema history. The connector then transitions to streaming from the redo logs. Use this setting to restore a corrupted or lost database schema history topic. Do not use if the database schema was modified after the connector stopped.              You can change the default value by specifying another option when configuring the `debezium-oracle` component.'
    - question: 'How does configuring the "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotData" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component affect the behavior of data snapshotting when ''snapshot.mode'' is set as configuration-based, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'Configuring the "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotData" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component allows you to control whether data should be snapshotted or not when ''snapshot.mode'' is set as configuration-based. The default value of this option is false, meaning that data snapshotting will not occur unless explicitly specified through this setting.

    - question: 'What should be the value of the `snapshotModeCustomName` option in an Apache Camel route using the Debezium Oracle component when you want to use a custom implementation for snapshotting the data, and how can you ensure that this custom implementation is called on each application boot to determine whether a snapshot is necessary?'
      answer: |
       'To utilize a custom implementation for snapshotting data in an Apache Camel route using the Debezium Oracle component, you should set the `snapshotModeCustomName` option to the name of your custom Snapshotter implementation that implements the ''Snapshotter'' interface and has its ''name()'' method defined. To ensure this custom implementation is called on each application boot to determine whether a snapshot is necessary, the implementation must be configured correctly within the Camel context or application startup logic.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the debezium-oracle component''s snapshotSelectStatementOverrides option to specify a select statement for retrieving data from a specific table during snapshotting, resuming snapshotting from a specific point in case of an interrupted previous snapshotting process?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the `debezium-oracle` component''s `snapshotSelectStatementOverrides` option to specify a select statement for retrieving data from a specific table during snapshotting, resuming snapshotting from a specific point in case of an interrupted previous snapshotting process, you should follow these steps:              1. In your Debezium configuration file, locate the section associated with the `debezium-oracle` connector.              2. Under that section, find the `snapshotSelectStatementOverrides` property and set its value to a comma-separated list of fully-qualified tables in the format `DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME` or `SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME`.              3. For each table you''ve specified in step 2, create additional properties with names like `snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME` or `snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME`, respectively.              4. Set the value of each new property to the select statement that you want to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting. This allows you to resume snapshotting from a specific point by adjusting the select statement''s `WHERE` clause or a similar condition.              5. Save your configuration file and restart the Debezium service for the changes to take effect.'

       'The "schemaHistoryInternalStoreOnlyCapturedDatabasesDdl" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" determines what DDL (Data Definition Language) statements will be stored in the database schema history. By default, it is set to true, which means only DDL that manipulates a table from the captured schema/database will be stored. If you set it to false, Debezium will store all incoming DDL statements from any source. This option is part of the "oracle" group in the configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "schemaHistoryInternalStoreOnlyCapturedTablesDdl" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle", and are there any prerequisites for changing its value?'
      answer: |
       'The "schemaHistoryInternalStoreOnlyCapturedTablesDdl" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" controls what Data Definition Language (DDL) statements Debezium stores in the database schema history. By default, it is set to false, meaning that Debezium will store all incoming DDL statements. If you set it to true, then only DDL that manipulates a captured table will be stored. Changing this value is optional, and there are no specific prerequisites beyond having the "debezium-oracle" component integrated into your system.'
    - question: 'What are the available values for the ''schemaNameAdjustmentMode'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-oracle'', and how do each of these options affect the schema names during data transfer? Specifically, can you explain the difference between ''avro'', ''avro_unicode'', and ''none'' modes? Also, is it necessary to specify a value for this option if none adjustment is required?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component ''debezium-oracle'', the ''schemaNameAdjustmentMode'' option allows you to specify how schema names should be adjusted for compatibility with the message converter used by the connector. There are three available values: ''avro'', ''avro_unicode'', and ''none''.              The ''avro'' mode replaces characters that cannot be used in the Avro type name with underscores (_). This is useful when you''re using an Avro converter for data transfer.              The ''avro_unicode'' mode goes a step further by replacing underscores or characters that cannot be used in the Avro type name with corresponding Unicode like _uxxxx. This can be beneficial if you need to handle more complex schema names.              On the other hand, ''none'' does not apply any adjustment. It is the default option and is suitable when no adjustment is required for your data transfer needs.              Finally, it is not necessary to specify a value for this option if none adjustment is required as ''none'' serves as the default setting.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "signalDataCollection" option within the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle", and is it a required configuration? If yes, is there a default value provided for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "signalDataCollection" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" is intended for sending signals or commands to Debezium. It''s important to note that signaling is disabled when not set. This option accepts a string value, but does not have a default value. You can configure it if needed, but it is not required in the standard group of configurations for the "oracle" component.'
    - question: 'How do you configure the list of channels that can be activated when using the signalEnabledChannels option in the debezium-oracle component of Apache Camel, and what is its default value if no custom configuration is specified?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the list of channels that can be activated when using the `signalEnabledChannels` option in the `debezium-oracle` component of Apache Camel, you specify an array of channel names. If no custom configuration is provided for this option, the source channel (denoted as "source") will be enabled by default. This means that data will flow through the source channel unless explicitly configured otherwise. The `debezium-oracle` component belongs to the "oracle" group in Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible data types for the optional configuration parameter "signalPollIntervalMs" in the Apache Camel''s Debezium Oracle component, and can it be set to a custom duration value if not provided?'
      answer: |
       'The optional configuration parameter "signalPollIntervalMs" in the Apache Camel''s Debezium Oracle component defaults to 5 seconds (5s). It is of type "duration", meaning it accepts values given in milliseconds or time units. If not provided, it can be set to a custom duration value as per your application requirements.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component to skip both insert/create (''c'') and update (''u'') operations during streaming?'
      answer: |
       'To skip both insert/create (''c'') and update (''u'') operations during streaming with the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component, you can configure the "skippedOperations" option to include ''cu''. This means that you will only allow truncate (''t''), delete (''d''), and no operations (indicated by ''none''). However, note that by default, only truncate operations will be skipped. To ensure both insert and update operations are also skipped, you''ll need to explicitly set ''skippedOperations'' to ''cu''.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum number of attempts that Apache Camel''s debezium-oracle component will attempt to retry database errors during snapshots, if the ''snapshotDatabaseErrorsMaxRetries'' option is explicitly set in the configuration, and what is its default value if it is not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The maximum number of attempts that Apache Camel''s debezium-oracle component will attempt to retry database errors during snapshots, if ''snapshotDatabaseErrorsMaxRetries'' option is explicitly set in the configuration, is an integer value. If this option is not specified, its default value is 0.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the option "snapshotDelayMs" in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle", if it is not explicitly configured, and what are its possible configurations if it''s required?'
      answer: |
       'The option "snapshotDelayMs" for the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" has a default value of 0ms (milliseconds). Its data type is duration, meaning it expects a numerical value followed by the unit "ms". If you choose to configure it, it allows for a delay period before a snapshot will begin. However, if not explicitly configured, Debezium starts capturing changes immediately. This option can be found within the "oracle" group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) for the Apache Camel component debezium-oracle''s option named "snapshotFetchSize", and is it required or optional in configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle"''s option "snapshotFetchSize" specifies the maximum number of records that should be loaded into memory while performing a snapshot during database change events. Its default value is null, meaning no default value is set. This option is optional, as it can be configured according to your specific needs if required in the component configuration for the Oracle group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "snapshotIncludeCollectionList" option in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component, and is it required for the configuration? (Answer: This setting must be used to specify a list of tables/collections whose snapshot is taken when creating or restarting the connector. The default value is null and it''s not required for the configuration.)'
      answer: |
       'The "snapshotIncludeCollectionList" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component is designed to specify a list of tables/collections whose snapshot should be taken when creating or restarting the connector. Its default value is null, meaning no tables/collections are specified by default. It''s important to note that this setting is optional in the configuration.'
    - question: 'What are the possible values for the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" option named "snapshotLockingMode", and what does each value do in terms of how the connector holds locks on tables while performing the schema snapshot? Is it safe to use ''none'' mode if schema changes are happening during the snapshot process?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" option named "snapshotLockingMode" can have two values: ''shared'' (default) and ''none''.              The ''shared'' value indicates that the connector will hold a table lock while performing the initial portion of the schema snapshot. This prevents exclusive table access for just the initial portion of the snapshot, allowing other processes to read from the tables. The remaining work in a snapshot involves selecting all rows from each table, and this is done using a flashback query that requires no locks.              The ''none'' value, on the other hand, avoids locks entirely. However, it is important to note that using ''none'' mode is only safe if no schema changes are happening while the snapshot is taken. In case of schema changes during the snapshot process, it may lead to inconsistencies in the data being captured. Therefore, careful consideration should be given before choosing the ''none'' mode.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and maximum duration for the "snapshotLockTimeoutMs" option in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "snapshotLockTimeoutMs" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component is set to 10 seconds (10s). This option determines the maximum number of milliseconds to wait for table locks at the beginning of a snapshot. If locks cannot be acquired within this time frame, the snapshot will be aborted. It''s worth noting that this option is not required when using this component, as its usage is optional.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and maximum configurable limit for the number of threads used in a snapshot operation when using the debezium-oracle component in Apache Camel, if this configuration option (snapshotMaxThreads) is explicitly set?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the number of threads used in a snapshot operation when using the "debezium-oracle" component in Apache Camel is 1. However, you can configure the maximum limit for this number of threads explicitly through the "snapshotMaxThreads" option. The configurable limit for this setting is an integer value.'
    - question: 'What are the different snapshot modes available for the debezium-oracle component in Apache Camel, and what is the default behavior of snapshotMode when not specified? Also, please explain the functionality of each mode.'
      answer: |
       'The Debezium-Oracle component in Apache Camel offers several snapshot modes to control when a snapshot should be taken upon connector startup. These modes include ''always'', ''initial'' (default), ''initial_only'', ''schema_only'', and ''schema_only_recovery''.              1. ''always'': In this mode, the connector runs a snapshot every time it starts, followed by streaming changes from the redo logs. This ensures that the connector always starts with up-to-date data.              2. ''initial'' (default): If the connector does not detect any offsets for the logical server name, it performs an initial snapshot capturing the current full state of the configured tables. After the snapshot completes, the connector begins to stream changes from the redo logs. This is useful when starting the connector for the first time or when there are no existing offsets.              3. ''initial_only'': The connector performs an initial snapshot like the ''initial'' mode but stops afterwards and does not stream changes from the redo logs. It is useful if you only want to capture the initial state of the tables but don''t need real-time updates.              4. ''schema_only'': In this mode, if the connector does not detect any offsets for the logical server name, it performs a snapshot that captures only the schema (table structures), but not any table data. After the snapshot completes, the connector begins to stream changes from the redo logs. This is useful when you want to keep track of your database structure without worrying about data updates.              5. ''schema_only_recovery'': This mode performs a snapshot that captures only the database schema history. The connector then transitions to streaming from the redo logs. Use this setting to restore a corrupted or lost database schema history topic. However, do not use it if the database schema was modified after the connector stopped.              The default behavior of the snapshotMode when not specified is ''initial''.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotData" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle", and is it a required setting?'
      answer: |
       'The "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotData" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" allows you to control when data should be snapshotted, particularly when ''snapshot.mode'' is set as configuration_based. By default, this setting is set to false, meaning that data snapshotting is not enabled by default. It''s an optional setting, and it falls under the "oracle" group.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the debezium-oracle component option named "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnDataError" and can this option be set to true if ''snapshot.mode'' is configuration-based in Oracle group?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnDataError" option within the "debezium-oracle" component is false. However, it can be set to true when ''snapshot.mode'' is configured as ''configuration_based'' in the Oracle group if desired.'
    - question: 'Given the information provided, here''s a potential question that could be asked:              "What is the default behavior and purpose of the ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnSchemaError'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-oracle'', and can this configuration setting be marked as required when using it?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnSchemaError'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-oracle'' allows you to specify whether a schema should be snapshotted or not in case of error, when ''snapshot.mode'' is set as configuration_based. By default, this setting is disabled (false). It''s worth noting that this configuration is optional, meaning it can be omitted during setup.'
    - question: 'Given the description of the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" option "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotSchema", I have a question: What is the default value and purpose of the "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotSchema" option when using the debezium-oracle component in Apache Camel, and under what circumstances can it be set to true?'

       'The "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedStartStream" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" allows you to configure whether a stream should start or not after snapshot, provided that ''snapshot.mode'' is set as configuration-based. Its default value is false, meaning that if not explicitly specified, the stream will not start after snapshot. This option is not required and belongs to the "oracle" group.'
    - question: 'What should be the value for the "snapshotModeCustomName" option in an Apache Camel route when using the Debezium Oracle component, if we intend to specify a custom implementation for the snapshotter interface? And is it necessary to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'To specify a custom implementation for the Snapshotter interface when using the Debezium Oracle component in an Apache Camel route, you should provide a non-null string value for the "snapshotModeCustomName" option. This value should be the name of your custom implementation as it''s returned by its ''name()'' method. It is not mandatory to provide a value for this option if you are using the default snapshot mode provided by Debezium Oracle.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "snapshotSelectStatementOverrides" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component, and how can a specific point be set for resuming snapshotting for large append-only tables?'
      answer: |
       'The "snapshotSelectStatementOverrides" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component allows you to customize select statements for specific tables during snapshotting. This can be particularly useful for large append-only tables, where a previous snapshotting process may have been interrupted.              To set a specific point for resuming snapshotting, you would define a select statement that starts data collection from a particular row or timestamp. Each table''s custom select statement is configured using properties like ''snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME'' or ''snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME''. The value of these properties should be the select statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting. This way, you can specify where to start (resume) data collection when needed.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and valid options for controlling the order in which tables are processed during the initial snapshot when using the "snapshotTablesOrderByRowCount" option of the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component, and how can it be configured to order table processing by row count either ascending or descending?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for controlling the order in which tables are processed during the initial snapshot when using the "snapshotTablesOrderByRowCount" option of the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component is disabled (no ordering by row count). However, if you wish to order table processing by row count either ascending or descending, you can configure it as a string value. A value of ''ascending'' will order tables in an ascending manner by row count, while ''descending'' will order them in a descending manner. If not specified, the option remains disabled.'

      answer: |
       'The default value for the `streamingDelayMs` option within the Apache Camel component `debezium-oracle` is 0 milliseconds. This option introduces a delay period after the snapshot is completed before the streaming begins, as specified in milliseconds. In other words, it sets a gap between when the data replication finishes capturing the initial snapshot and when the continuous data stream starts flowing. If this option is not set, no delay will occur.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, and whether it''s required for the configuration option "tableExcludeList" in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" when using Oracle database?'
      answer: |
       'The "tableExcludeList" configuration option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" is designed to exclude specific tables from monitoring when using an Oracle database. It accepts a list of regular expressions, separated by commas, which match the fully-qualified names of tables. The default value for this option is null, meaning that all tables are monitored unless explicitly excluded. The data type of this option is a string, and it''s not required, meaning you can choose to use it or not during configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the tableIncludeList option in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The `tableIncludeList` option within the Apache Camel''s Debezium-Oracle component serves to specify the tables for which changes will be captured during data synchronization. Its default value is null, meaning that all tables in the Oracle database are included unless explicitly specified otherwise. This option is not a requirement when using the component, as it can be left undefined if you wish to capture changes from all tables in the database.'
    - question: 'What are the available options for the timePrecisionMode setting in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component and what is their respective precision for time, date, and timestamp values? Also, what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component, the timePrecisionMode setting has three available options: ''adaptive'' (default), ''adaptive_time_microseconds'', and ''connect''. The ''adaptive'' mode bases the precision of time, date, and timestamp values on the database column''s precision. The ''adaptive_time_microseconds'' mode works similarly to ''adaptive'', but TIME fields always use microseconds precision. The ''connect'' mode represents time, date, and timestamp values using Kafka Connect''s built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which uses millisecond precision regardless of the database columns'' precision. The default value for this option is ''adaptive''.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the ''tombstonesOnDelete'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-oracle'', and can it be set to emit a tombstone event for each delete operation?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the ''tombstonesOnDelete'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-oracle'' is to emit a tombstone event for each delete operation. This means that when a record is deleted from your Oracle database, not only will a delete event be sent to Kafka, but also a subsequent tombstone event will be emitted. This default behavior allows Kafka to completely remove all events related to the given key once the source record has been deleted from the database. However, if you wish to change this behavior, you can set ''tombstonesOnDelete'' to false, which would then only send a delete event without the subsequent tombstone event.'
    - question: 'What is the default TopicNamingStrategy class used in an Apache Camel route when using the debezium-oracle component, and can this default value be overridden if desired?'
      answer: |
       'The default TopicNamingStrategy class used in an Apache Camel route when utilizing the "debezium-oracle" component is "io.debezium.schema.SchemaTopicNamingStrategy". If you wish to override this default value, it can be done as the setting is not mandatory (required=false).'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, acceptable character set, and required status of the "topicPrefix" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle", and which groups of configuration options does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The "topicPrefix" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" serves as a unique identifier for the particular database server/cluster that this connector is capturing changes from. It forms the prefix for all Kafka topic names receiving events emitted by this connector.              The default value for this option is null, meaning you have to provide your own unique prefix. The acceptable character set includes alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-), dots (.), and underscores (_). It''s crucial to note that since the topic prefix is used across all other connectors, it must be unique.              Lastly, the "topicPrefix" option is of type "string" and is required for configuration, belonging to the "oracle" group of options in the larger configuration context.'
