    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "additionalProperties" option in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component, and what format should be used when setting values for these properties? Additionally, are there any default values set for these additional properties and which group do they belong to in terms of configuration settings?'
      answer: |
       'The "additionalProperties" option in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component is intended for setting properties that cannot be directly configured on Camel configurations. This is useful, for instance, when requiring specific Kafka Connect properties needed by Debezium engine like setting KafkaOffsetBackingStore. To set values for these properties, you should prefix the property name with "additionalProperties.", followed by the actual property name and its value, separated by an equal sign (=). For example: `"additionalProperties.transactional.id=12345", "additionalProperties.schema.registry.url=http://localhost:8811/avro"`              These properties have no default values as specified in the information provided. Regarding configuration groups, they belong to the common group.'
    - question: 'Here is a question that could be asked based on the provided information:              "Can the `debezium-oracle` component in Apache Camel use the Camel routing Error Handler to process exceptions that occur while it''s trying to pick up incoming messages? If yes, how can this feature be enabled?"'
      answer: |
       'Yes, the `debezium-oracle` component in Apache Camel can use the Camel routing Error Handler to process exceptions that occur while it''s trying to pick up incoming messages. This functionality can be enabled by setting the "bridgeErrorHandler" option to true when configuring the `debezium-oracle` component. If you don''t explicitly set this option, the default behavior is to use the built-in Apache Camel Exception Handler which logs exceptions at WARN or ERROR level and ignores them.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "configuration" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle", and is it a required setting when using it as a consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The "configuration" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" is designed to allow pre-set configurations to be applied. However, it does not have a default value (defaultValue: null). Whether or not to use this option is optional when working with it as a consumer, as indicated by the "required": false property in its group "consumer".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "internalValueConverter" option in the Apache Camel "debezium-oracle" component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option when using this component? Furthermore, if a custom Converter class is chosen instead of the JSON converter as the default, what group does the selected Converter class belong to within the context of the consumer?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel "debezium-oracle" component, the "internalValueConverter" option serves the purpose of specifying a custom Converter class for serializing and deserializing offset data values. By default, the JsonConverter (org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter) is utilized. Using a custom Converter class isn''t mandatory, as the provided JSON converter works by default.              If you decide to use a custom Converter class, it belongs to the "consumer" group within the component context.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and possible values for the Apache Camel debezium-oracle option named "offsetCommitPolicy", and is it required when using this component? Furthermore, can you explain what kind of Java class should be implemented to customize this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetCommitPolicy" option for the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component is responsible for defining when offset commits are triggered based on the number of events processed and the time elapsed since the last commit. This class must implement the ''OffsetCommitPolicy'' interface and can be a custom Java class. The default value is set to a periodic commit policy based upon time intervals, but it can be overridden by providing a custom implementation when needed. It''s not mandatory to specify this option as its use depends on your specific data consumption requirements. If you want to customize the commit policy, create a Java class that implements the OffsetCommitPolicy interface.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum waiting time, in milliseconds, for records to flush and offset data commitment to storage when using the ''offsetCommitTimeoutMs'' option of the ''debezium-oracle'' component in Apache Camel, if the option is not specified, and what is its default value? Also, what data type does it use, and under which group is this option found?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the ''offsetCommitTimeoutMs'' option with the ''debezium-oracle'' component in Apache Camel, if this option is not specified, the maximum waiting time for records to flush and offset data commitment to storage defaults to 5000 milliseconds (or 5 seconds). The data type it uses is "duration". This option falls under the consumer group.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the ''offsetFlushIntervalMs'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component, and can it be set to a custom duration value during consumption? Additionally, what group does this option belong to in the consumer settings?'
      answer: |
       'The ''offsetFlushIntervalMs'' option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component is designed to specify an interval at which to attempt committing offsets. Its default value is set to 60,000 milliseconds (1 minute). This duration determines how often Debezium will commit the offsets during consumption, ensuring that the consumed data is consistently and reliably committed. It''s important to note that this option can be configured with a custom duration value if needed during consumption. Lastly, this option falls under the ''consumer'' group in the consumer settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default Java class for offset storage when using the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component, if the offsetStorage option is not specifically set by the user in their configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The default Java class for offset storage when utilizing the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component, without a specific offsetStorage setting from the user in their configuration, is org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.FileOffsetBackingStore.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the `offsetStorageFileName` option in the Apache Camel `debezium-oracle` component, and is it a required configuration when using the FileOffsetBackingStore for offset storage?'
      answer: |
       'The `offsetStorageFileName` option in the Apache Camel `debezium-oracle` component is designed to specify the path where the offsets will be stored. This is important when you set the `offset.storage` to the `FileOffsetBackingStore`. By default, it has no value. However, providing a value for this option is not mandatory as it''s optional in the consumer group of configurations.'
    - question: '"In the Apache Camel''s Debezium Oracle component, what is the purpose and default value of the `offsetStoragePartitions` option, and under what conditions is it required to be set?"'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel''s Debezium Oracle component, the `offsetStoragePartitions` option determines the number of partitions used when creating the offset storage topic. This setting is necessary only when the ''KafkaOffsetBackingStore'' is set for the offset storage. The default value for this option is not specified, and it can be optionally set under consumer-related configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "offsetStorageReplicationFactor" option in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component and what value does it have by default if not specified? Also, can this option be considered as a required configuration parameter when using KafkaOffsetBackingStore for offset storage?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s debezium-oracle component, the "offsetStorageReplicationFactor" option configures the replication factor used for creating the offset storage topic, particularly when the offset.storage is set to KafkaOffsetBackingStore. This value determines the number of replicas maintained in your Kafka cluster. By default, if not specified, it does not have a default value. However, it''s essential to note that while this option isn''t strictly required, it becomes necessary when using KafkaOffsetBackingStore for offset storage. This means you should consider setting an appropriate value for replication factor based on your specific requirements and the desired level of data durability.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "offsetStorageTopic" option in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "offsetStorageTopic" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component is used to specify the name of a Kafka topic where offsets will be stored. This is relevant when the `offset.storage` configuration is set to the KafkaOffsetBackingStore. Although it''s not required, providing a value for this option allows you to configure a custom Kafka topic for offset storage purposes in the context of consuming data from Oracle databases using Debezium with Apache Camel. The default value for "offsetStorageTopic" is null.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel''s debezium-oracle component, and can this option be considered as optional in configuration? (Hint: The option determines whether automatic autowiring is enabled, which allows the component to look up a matching instance from the registry to configure it without explicit setting. This feature can be used for auto-configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc.)'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in Apache Camel''s debezium-oracle component is a boolean setting that determines whether automatic autowiring is enabled for this component. This feature allows the component to look up a matching instance from the registry for configuration purposes, eliminating the need for explicit setting. The default value of this option is true, indicating that automatic autowiring is enabled by default. While not required in the strictest sense, considering it as optional in configuration may restrict some convenient features such as auto-configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, among others. Hence, while it might not be mandatory in all cases, it is recommended to explore the benefits that this advanced option offers.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "archiveDestinationName" option in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component, if it''s not set by default, where will the connector automatically select archive logs for reading from, and what type of value can be assigned to this option if a user wishes to specify it manually?'
      answer: |
       'The "archiveDestinationName" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component is used to set a specific archive log destination as the source for reading archive logs. If this option is not specified, the connector will automatically choose the first LOCAL and VALID archive log destination it finds for reading from. The type of value that can be assigned to this option is a string, should a user wish to specify it manually.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and potential range for the "archiveLogHours" option within the "debezium-oracle" component in Apache Camel when using it to mine archive logs from an Oracle database, and is it necessary to provide a value if I want to mine all available archive logs?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the Debezium-Oracle component within Apache Camel for mining archive logs from an Oracle database, the default value for the "archiveLogHours" option is 0. This means that by not providing a specific value, you will mine all available archive logs. The potential range for this option is any positive or zero integer.'
    - question: 'What are the different options available for specifying how binary columns should be represented in change events when using the debezium-oracle component in Apache Camel, and what is their effect on binary data representation (e.g., ''bytes'', ''base64'', ''base64-url-safe'', ''hex'')? Additionally, what is the default option for this setting, and is it a required configuration option?'
      answer: |
       'When using the debezium-oracle component in Apache Camel, you have four options to specify how binary columns should be represented in change events: ''bytes'' (default), ''base64'', ''base64-url-safe'', and ''hex''.              1. ''bytes'' represents binary data as a byte array. This is the default setting.       2. ''base64'' represents binary data as a base64-encoded string.       3. ''base64-url-safe'' represents binary data as a base64-url-safe-encoded string.       4. ''hex'' represents binary data as a hex-encoded (base16) string.              It is worth noting that this configuration option is not required; it defaults to the ''bytes'' option if left unspecified.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, type, and group association of the "columnExcludeList" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component, and is its use optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "columnExcludeList" option within the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component is a configuration that allows you to define regular expressions for columns you wish to exclude from change events. Its default value is null, meaning no columns are excluded by default. The type of this option is string, and its usage is optional as indicated by the "required": false property. It is associated with the Oracle group of options within the Debezium-Oracle component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "columnIncludeList" option within the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle", and is it required or optional? Additionally, where can this option be found in terms of the groups it belongs to?'
      answer: |
       'The "columnIncludeList" option within the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" serves the purpose of including specific columns in change events. This option uses regular expressions for pattern matching. The default value for this option is not specified. It''s an optional parameter, meaning it can be provided or omitted based on the user''s requirements. This option belongs to the "oracle" group of settings within the debezium-oracle component.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component''s `columnPropagateSourceType` option to include column original types and lengths in the emitted change records, using a comma-separated list of regular expressions for the fully-qualified names of columns that should be affected? And is it optional or required to provide values for this configuration?'
      answer: |
       'To include column original types and lengths in the emitted change records from Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle, you can configure the `columnPropagateSourceType` option using a comma-separated list of regular expressions for the fully-qualified names of columns that should be affected. For example, if you want to include column A''s original type and length from schema B.SCHEMA_NAME, you would specify ''B\.SCHEMA_NAME\.A'' in your list of regular expressions.              It is not a required configuration, as the `defaultValue` is null, meaning that you can choose to include this feature if desired, with the option being available under the "oracle" group for specific Oracle database configurations.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom converter for the ''debezium-oracle'' component in Apache Camel, if I have a list of converters defined, and what is the format to define and configure these custom converters?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom converter for the ''debezium-oracle'' component in Apache Camel when you have a list of custom converters defined, you need to follow these steps:              1. Define your custom converters using the ''.type'' config option. For instance, if you have a Java class called `MyCustomConverter`, the format would be as follows:              ```        MyCustomConverter.type = MyPackageName.MyClassFullName       ```              2. Configure each custom converter using options ''.'' with the relevant properties. The specific configuration will depend on your custom converter class requirements, but an example of how to configure a custom converter named `MyCustomConverter` could look like this:              ```        MyCustomConverter.myProperty1 = myValue1        MyCustomConverter.myProperty2 = myValue2       ```              Make sure to add these custom converters under the "converters" configuration section for the ''debezium-oracle'' component.              3. In your Camel route, use the configured custom converter as usual:              ```       from("debezium://myOracleEndpoint")        .to("myCamelEndpoint")        .unmarshal().myCustomConverter();       ```'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and syntax of using custom metric tags in the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component (debezium-oracle), specifically how to format key-value pairs for customizing the MBean object name? Also, is it optional or required to provide values for these custom tags?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component, custom metric tags are utilized to personalize the MBean object name. The syntax for defining custom metric tags involves key-value pairs, where each key stands for a tag associated with the MBean object name, while the corresponding value represents the specific value related to that particular key.              For instance, consider using "k1=v1, k2=v2" as an example of a tag pair; here, ''k1'' and ''k2'' are keys, and ''v1'' and ''v2'' are their respective values. These custom metric tags get appended to the end of the default MBean object name, thus resulting in a unique, customized MBean object name.              It is essential to note that providing custom metric tags for the debezium-oracle component is optional; if no custom tag pairs are provided, the standard MBean object name will remain unaffected.'
    - question: 'What are the available options for the debezium-oracle component in Apache Camel, specifically the ''databaseConnectionAdapter'' option, and what is the default value and possible data types? Is it required and under which group does this option belong?'
      answer: |
       'The ''databaseConnectionAdapter'' option available for the ''debezium-oracle'' component in Apache Camel offers two alternatives: ''logminer'' (the default) and ''xstream''. These options determine the method used to capture database changes: ''logminer'' uses Oracle''s native LogMiner, while ''xstream'' employs Oracle XStreams. The option takes a string value and is not mandatory, meaning it can be set if desired, belonging under the ''oracle'' group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "databaseDbname" option in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "databaseDbname" option within the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component is used to specify the name of the database from which changes should be captured by the connector. By default, no database (i.e., null) is set for this option. Using this option is not required; it is optional and can be skipped when utilizing the debezium-oracle component.'
    - question: 'What should be the data type and a brief explanation for the optional parameter "databaseHostname" in the Apache Camel''s debezium-oracle component, when providing the hostname or IP address of the database server? (Data Type: string; Brief Explanation: Provides the resolvable hostname or IP address of the database server)'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s debezium-oracle component, the optional parameter "databaseHostname" is of data type "string". This parameter should be provided with the resolvable hostname or IP address of the database server. While this value is not required (indicated by the "required": false), it''s crucial for establishing a connection to the Oracle database when using this component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the optional string parameter "databaseOutServerName" in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-oracle'' and which group of settings does it belong to if not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The option "databaseOutServerName" within the Apache Camel component ''debezium-oracle'' is an optional string parameter. Its purpose is to specify the name of the XStream Out server to connect to when using Debezium with Oracle databases. By default, this parameter does not have a value (defaultValue: null). If not specified, it belongs to the "oracle" group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the required string value for the option "databasePassword" in the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component, if it''s not set by default and must be provided when connecting to the Oracle database?'
      answer: |
       'The required string value for the option "databasePassword" in the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component is a password for the database user that needs to be specified when connecting to an Oracle database, as it is set to null by default and marked as "required=true".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "databasePdbName" option for the "debezium-oracle" component in Apache Camel, if a multi-tenant setup is being used with Oracle Database, and whether its use is optional?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the "debezium-oracle" component within Apache Camel for a multi-tenant setup with an Oracle Database, the "databasePdbName" option provides you with the ability to specify the name of the pluggable database (PDB). If no specific PDB is specified via this option and the Database is a container database (CDB), the CDB name should be given via the standard property `database.dbname`. It''s important to note that while supplying a "databasePdbName" is optional, its usage can be valuable in scenarios where working with individual PDBs is necessary for better organization and resource management within your multi-tenant database setup.'
    - question: 'What is the default port value for the debezium-oracle component''s databasePort option in Apache Camel, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this configuration? Also, could you clarify which group this configuration option belongs to?'
      answer: |
       'The default port value for the "databasePort" option within the "debezium-oracle" component of Apache Camel is 1528. Providing a value for this configuration is not mandatory, as it has been marked as an optional field ("required": false). This configuration option belongs to the "oracle" group, indicating that it applies specifically to Oracle-related settings within Apache Camel''s Debezium connector.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the "databaseUrl" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle", and can it be configured with a JDBC URL instead of specifying separate hostname, port, and database properties? Also, is the provision of a default value for this option and is its use mandatory or optional?'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s "debezium-oracle" component, the "databaseUrl" option serves as an alternative way to specify the complete JDBC URL instead of providing separate hostname, port, and database properties. This feature allows for more flexible connection scenarios when using this component. It is an optional configuration property (its use is not mandatory) in the "oracle" group and its default value is null. So you can configure the "debezium-oracle" component with a JDBC URL directly via the "databaseUrl" option, which will simplify your setup if you prefer this approach over specifying separate properties for hostname, port, and database.'
    - question: 'What is the default and optional value for the "databaseUser" option in the Apache Camel''s "debezium-oracle" component, if it is not specified during configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "databaseUser" option in Apache Camel''s "debezium-oracle" component is null, meaning you need to provide this value explicitly when configuring if you wish to use a specific database user to connect to the Oracle database.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "datatypePropagateSourceType" option within the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component, and under what circumstances would it be necessary to provide a non-default string regular expression value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "datatypePropagateSourceType" option within the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component is designed to propagate the original data type and its length from the source database to the emitted change records. It does so by accepting a comma-separated list of regular expressions that match specific database-specific data types. By default, this option has no value set (i.e., null).              You would provide a non-default string regular expression value for this option if you want to specify the exact data types from your Oracle database where propagating the original data type and length is necessary. For instance, when dealing with custom or complex data types in your Oracle schema that might not be automatically detected without explicitly specifying them using regular expressions.'
    - question: 'What are the available options for the "decimalHandlingMode" setting in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle", and how do they differ in terms of representing DECIMAL and NUMERIC columns in change events? Additionally, can you explain what is the default value of this option, and is its use mandatory when configuring this component?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle", the available options for the "decimalHandlingMode" setting include: ''precise'' (the default), ''string'', and ''double''. Each option specifies how DECIMAL and NUMERIC columns should be represented in change events. ''Precise'' uses java.math.BigDecimal to represent values, which are encoded using a binary representation and Kafka Connect''s ''org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Decimal'' type. This offers the best precision but may require more memory and processing resources. ''String'', on the other hand, simply uses strings to represent values, offering less precision but simpler usage in consumers. Lastly, ''double'' represents values using Java''s double data type, which may not provide the same level of precision as the other options, but will be significantly easier for many consumers to handle and process. The default value is ''precise'', and its use is optional when configuring this component.'
    - question: 'What is the default and maximum value for the ''errorsMaxRetries'' option in the Apache Camel ''debezium-oracle'' component, if a specific value is not provided when using it? Additionally, can this option be considered mandatory or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the ''errorsMaxRetries'' option in the Apache Camel ''debezium-oracle'' component is unlimited (-1), meaning there''s no limit to the number of retries on connection errors before failing. It can be set to any integer if a specific value is desired, but its use is considered optional since it has a default value and setting it to 0 will disable retries altogether.'
    - question: 'What are the available options for handling failure during the processing of events in Apache Camel when using the Debezium Oracle component, and what is the default behavior when this option is not specified?'
      answer: |
       'When using the Debezium-Oracle component in Apache Camel, there are three options available for handling failures during event processing: ''fail'', ''warn'', and ''ignore''. The default behavior when this option is not specified is to use the ''fail'' mode, where an exception indicating the problematic event and its position is raised, causing the connector to stop. In ''warn'' mode, the problematic event and its position will be logged and the event will be skipped. Lastly, in ''ignore'' mode, the problematic event will simply be skipped without raising any exceptions or logging information.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "heartbeatActionQuery" option in the Apache Camel''s Debezium Oracle component, and is it a required configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "heartbeatActionQuery" option within Apache Camel''s Debezium Oracle component is an optional string type configuration that defines the query executed with every heartbeat. By default, there is no predefined value for this option, meaning you can provide your custom query if desired but it''s not necessary to set one.'
    - question: 'What is the default value, data type, and description for the Apache Camel "heartbeatIntervalMs" option in the Debezium-Oracle component, and is it mandatory to set this option? Additionally, what group does it belong to within the Debezium-Oracle component''s settings?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the Apache Camel "heartbeatIntervalMs" option in the Debezium-Oracle component is 0ms. This option belongs to the type of duration and describes the length of an interval, in milliseconds, during which the connector periodically sends heartbeat messages to a heartbeat topic. Use a non-zero value to enable these messages; setting it to 0 will disable them. It''s important to note that this setting is optional, as it can be disabled by default. This option falls under the "oracle" group within the Debezium-Oracle component''s settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the option "heartbeatTopicsPrefix" in the Apache Camel''s debezium-oracle component, and can this setting be overridden when configuring a camel route?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the option "heartbeatTopicsPrefix" in Apache Camel''s debezium-oracle component is "__debezium-heartbeat". This setting can be overridden when configuring a Camel route if desired, as it is not required and accepts string values.'
    - question: 'Here''s a potential question for further understanding about the `includeSchemaChanges` option in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component:              "If the `includeSchemaChanges` option of the debezium-oracle component is set to false, what will be the impact on the Kafka topic that corresponds to the database server ID? Will any schema changes still be recorded or published?"'
      answer: |
       'If `includeSchemaChanges` option of the Debezium Oracle connector is set to false, no schema changes will be published to the Kafka topic corresponding to the database server ID. Thus, schema changes will not be recorded or distributed via that Kafka topic. However, this configuration only affects the publication of schema changes and does not impact the internal recording of the database schema history within the connector.'
    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the "includeSchemaComments" option in the Apache Camel component Debezium-Oracle (debezium-oracle) impact memory usage, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "includeSchemaComments" option in the Apache Camel component Debezium-Oracle (debezium-oracle) may significantly affect memory usage because it adds a comment String to each ColumnImpl object, which can be quite heavy. This option determines whether the connector will parse table and column comments into metadata objects. Keeping this setting as its default value (''false'') can help reduce memory consumption since the number and size of these objects primarily decide the memory footprint taken by Debezium connectors. It''s important to consider the trade-off between retaining schema comments for easier understanding of your data models and managing memory usage efficiently, especially when dealing with large datasets.'
    - question: 'What are the available strategies for watermarking during an incremental snapshot when using the debezium-oracle component in Apache Camel and what is their behavior? Specifically, how does the ''insert_delete'' strategy differ from the default ''insert_insert'' strategy in terms of open and close signals written into the signal data collection?'
      answer: |
       'When using the "debezium-oracle" component in Apache Camel for an incremental snapshot, you can specify the watermarking strategy through the "incrementalSnapshotWatermarkingStrategy" option. The available strategies are ''insert_insert'' (default) and ''insert_delete''.              In the default ''insert_insert'' strategy, both open and close signals are written into the signal data collection. This means that an open signal is created when a new row is inserted into the table, and a close signal is generated when that row is deleted or updated.              On the other hand, the ''insert_delete'' strategy only writes an open signal on the signal data collection. The close signal in this case will be written as a deletion of the relative open signal. This means that an open signal is created for new rows as usual, but when the corresponding row is deleted or updated, the related open signal will effectively be closed by being removed from the data collection.'

Online catalog: This strategy mines changes faster as it does not capture DDL statements, which are Data Definition Language commands used to create, modify, and delete the structure of databases like tables, indexes, or schemas. This makes it quicker at capturing data changes but does not preserve these schema-related events.              2. Data dictionary loaded into REDO LOG files: In this approach, the entire database''s schema is captured as DDL statements, and all subsequent changes, including DML (Data Manipulation Language) operations, are also logged in the redo log files. This strategy allows for a more comprehensive view of the database schema and data changes but may be slower due to the additional data logging involved.              You can adjust the `logMiningStrategy` according to your requirements within the "oracle" group, which includes these configuration settings related to Oracle databases when using Debezium with Apache Camel.'

    - question: 'How does modifying the "schemaHistoryInternalSkipUnparseableDdl" option in the Apache Camel component Debezium-Oracle affect the behavior of the connector when it encounters unparsable DDL statements during operation, and what are the potential implications of setting this value to true?'
      answer: |
       'Modifying the "schemaHistoryInternalSkipUnparseableDdl" option in the Apache Camel component Debezium-Oracle allows you to control the behavior of the connector when it encounters unparsable DDL statements in the binlog during operation. By default, the connector will stop functioning when it cannot parse a DDL statement, but by setting this option to true, it will ignore such statements instead, enabling the connector to continue operating.              However, it''s important to note that skipping unparseable DDL statements may result in missing some metadata changes since these statements will no longer halt the operation of the Debezium connector. Therefore, carefully consider whether it''s appropriate for your specific use case to enable this feature and potentially tolerate the risk of data inconsistencies or inaccuracies due to missed metadata changes.'
    - question: 'How does setting the "schemaHistoryInternalStoreOnlyCapturedDatabasesDdl" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" to true or false affect the type and storage of DDL statements captured by Debezium?

      answer: |
       'Setting the "schemaHistoryInternalStoreOnlyCapturedDatabasesDdl" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" to true means Debezium will store only DDL statements that manipulate a table from captured schema/database. If set to false, all incoming DDL statements will be stored. The default value for this option is false. This setting belongs to the "oracle" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the option "schemaHistoryInternalStoreOnlyCapturedTablesDdl" in the Apache Camel component named "debezium-oracle"? Does setting it to true have any specific effect on the DDL statements stored in the database schema history?'
      answer: |
       'The "schemaHistoryInternalStoreOnlyCapturedTablesDdl" option in the Apache Camel component called "debezium-oracle" controls what Data Definition Language (DDL) will be stored in the database schema history within Debezium. By default, Debezium stores all incoming DDL statements. However, if set to true, it will only store DDL that manipulates a captured table. This means only changes affecting tables being tracked by Debezium will be stored in the database schema history, while other DDL statements will be ignored.'
    - question: 'What are the valid options for adjusting schema names when using the ''debezium-oracle'' component in Apache Camel, and what is the purpose of each option (''avro'', ''avro_unicode'', ''none'') compared to the default value (none)? Is it possible to disable schema name adjustment with this configuration?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of using the ''debezium-oracle'' component in Apache Camel, you have three valid options for adjusting schema names: ''avro'', ''avro_unicode'', and ''none''.              The ''avro'' option replaces certain characters that cannot be used in Avro type names with underscores. This is useful when your database schema names don''t conform to the naming conventions required by the Avro format. The ''avro_unicode'' option, on the other hand, goes a step further by replacing underscores and other characters that can''t be used in Avro type names with their Unicode equivalents. This ensures even more compatibility with the Avro converter.              The default value is ''none'', which means no adjustment to the schema names will be made. If you prefer not to adjust the schema names, you can keep this setting as it is. However, if you need to make your schema names compatible with the Avro converter used by the Debezium Oracle connector, you can choose either ''avro'' or ''avro_unicode''.'

    - question: 'What are the possible values for the Apache Camel debezium-oracle option called "snapshotLockingMode", and what does each value imply regarding how locks are handled during a schema snapshot? Additionally, when might it be necessary to specify a value other than the default (''shared'')?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel Debezium Oracle option "snapshotLockingMode" has two possible values: ''shared'' (default) and ''none''.              The ''shared'' value indicates that the connector will hold a table lock while performing the initial portion of the schema snapshot. This prevents exclusive access to the tables, but for the remaining work in a snapshot - selecting all rows from each table using a flashback query - no locks are required as it''s read-only and doesn''t affect other operations.              On the other hand, if ''none'' is specified, no locks are held at any point during the snapshot. This mode should be used with caution, as it can only safely be employed when no schema changes are happening while the snapshot is taken. Specifying ''none'' might be necessary in situations where avoiding even initial table locks is essential, such as in environments that prioritize near-zero downtime or concurrent data modification tasks.'

    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel component Debezium-Oracle and under what conditions can it be configured to use the routing Error Handler for exception processing?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel component Debezium-Oracle allows you to bridge the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions that may occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages can now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. However, this is only possible if the third-party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. Some components handle exceptions internally only, in which case bridgeErrorHandler is not applicable. In situations where the Camel component can be improved to hook into the third-party component, bridgeErrorHandler may become possible for future releases. By default, the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to handle exceptions, which logs them at WARN or ERROR level and ignores them.'

      answer: |
       'The "incrementalSnapshotWatermarkingStrategy" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component can have two possible values: ''INSERT_INSERT'' (default) and ''INSERT_DELETE''.              The ''INSERT_INSERT'' strategy writes both open and close signals into the signal data collection. This means that an open signal is written when a new row is inserted, and a close signal is written when the same row is deleted or updated. The data collected between these two signals represents the incremental snapshot of the changes in your Oracle database.              On the other hand, the ''INSERT_DELETE'' strategy writes only the open signal on the signal data collection. Here, the close signal will be represented by deleting the relative open signal at a later time, usually when the corresponding row is deleted or updated in the source table. This approach can lead to fewer signals being written and potentially reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed for incremental snapshotting compared to the ''INSERT_INSERT'' strategy. However, it requires additional operations to manage the closure of the open signals and may add complexity to your processing pipeline.'

    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "logMiningBufferTransactionEventsThreshold" option in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component, and could you explain when it would be necessary to adjust this setting from its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "logMiningBufferTransactionEventsThreshold" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component is 0. This option specifies the maximum number of events a transaction can include before it is discarded, serving to manage buffer memory or space when dealing with very large transactions. If you encounter situations where your Oracle database produces transactions with an excessive number of events and this impacts your application''s performance, you may need to adjust this setting from its default value to a higher integer (e.g., 1000). This will prevent the buffer from being overwhelmed by large transactions, helping to maintain optimal performance and stability for your data replication process.'
    - question: 'What are the available options for the ''logMiningBufferType'' configuration in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component, what is the default option, and are any of these options required?

      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component, the ''logMiningBufferType'' configuration has three available options: memory, infinispan_embedded, and infinispan_remote. The default option is ''memory'', meaning it uses the JVM process'' heap to buffer all transaction data.              If you choose ''infinispan_embedded'', an embedded Infinispan cache will be used to buffer transaction data and persist it to disk. This is different from ''infinispan_remote'' where a remote Infinispan cluster is employed for buffering transaction data and persisting it to disk.              None of these options are required, as specified by the ''required'': false attribute in the configuration. You may adjust this setting according to your specific use case and infrastructure preferences.'

    - question: 'What is the purpose of setting the debezium-oracle option ''logMiningRestartConnection'' to ''true'' in an Apache Camel route, and what would be its impact on memory usage and performance? (Given that the default value is false, but it can be set to true if needed.)'
      answer: |
       'Setting the `debezium-oracle` option `logMiningRestartConnection` to ''true'' in an Apache Camel route aims to mitigate potential excessive SGA memory usage during data streaming with Debezium on Oracle databases. When this option is set to true, the connector will periodically close and reopen the database connection after every detected log switch or if the specified `log.mining.session.max.ms` time limit has been reached.              By restarting connections, it can help manage memory usage as the SGA memory won''t accumulate throughout the streaming phase. This may improve overall system performance by reducing the risk of encountering excessive memory issues and allowing for better resource allocation. Keep in mind that if you do not experience any memory-related concerns during your operations, the default value (`false`) should suffice without impact on performance. It''s always recommended to carefully evaluate and understand the implications of any configuration changes before implementing them.'

       'The default number of attempts to retry database errors during snapshot operations when utilizing the debezium-oracle component in Apache Camel is 0 retries. However, if you wish to configure this setting, it can be done as the option "snapshotDatabaseErrorsMaxRetries" is available within the debezium-oracle component group.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the option "snapshotDelayMs" in the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component, and what is its purpose within this context? If the user does not specify a value for it, will it be executed? And lastly, what kind of data type does this option handle (duration or otherwise)?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component, the default value for the option "snapshotDelayMs" is 0 milliseconds. This option represents a delay period before a snapshot will begin, used within this context to specify how long to wait before initiating a snapshot. If you do not explicitly set a value for it, the component will proceed without applying this delay. The type of data handled by this option is "duration".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''snapshotEnhancePredicateScn'' option in the Apache Camel ''debezium-oracle'' component, and is it optional or required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The ''snapshotEnhancePredicateScn'' option in the Apache Camel ''debezium-oracle'' component serves as a token to replace in snapshot predicate templates. Its default value is null, meaning no specific default value is provided for it. This option is optional; you do not have to provide a value for it when using the debezium-oracle component in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the Apache Camel component ''debezium-oracle'' option named ''snapshotFetchSize'', and is it mandatory to specify a value for this option during configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The ''snapshotFetchSize'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-oracle'' determines the maximum number of records that are loaded into memory while performing a snapshot. The default value for this option is null, meaning it can be specified or left unset at your discretion. This option is not mandatory during configuration as it can be set to a value based on the specific requirements of your application and database size.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "snapshotIncludeCollectionList" option within the Apache Camel "debezium-oracle" component, if it is set and not required? Also, can you provide an example of how this option might be used to specify a list of tables or collections to capture in a snapshot when the connector is initiated or restarted?'
      answer: |
       'The "snapshotIncludeCollectionList" option within the Apache Camel "debezium-oracle" component is designed to allow you to specify a list of tables/collections that should have a snapshot taken when the connector is created or restarted. It''s an optional setting, and if not provided, it will have no default value.              For example, if you want to capture snapshots only for specific tables ''table1'', ''table2'', and ''collection1'' upon initializing or restarting the connector, you would set the option as follows:              ```json       {"snapshotIncludeCollectionList": ["table1","table2","collection1"]}       ```       This setting ensures that only the specified tables/collections will have their snapshots taken at the given instances.'
    - question: 'How does changing the value of the snapshotLockingMode option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component affect how locks are held on tables during schema snapshot, and under what conditions would it be safe to set it to ''none'' without causing conflicts with other database operations?'
      answer: |
       'Changing the value of the snapshotLockingMode option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component impacts how locks are handled on tables during schema snapshot. If you set it to ''shared'', which is the default, the connector will hold a table lock that prevents exclusive access for just the initial portion of the snapshot while it reads the database schemas and other metadata. The remaining work in a snapshot is done using a flashback query that requires no additional locks.              On the other hand, setting ''snapshotLockingMode'' to ''none'' allows you to avoid locks entirely. This mode is only safe to use if no schema changes are happening while the snapshot is taken, as the absence of locks could potentially lead to conflicts with concurrent database operations. So, it''s recommended to carefully consider the database activity and synchronize snapshots accordingly when using ''none''.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum duration (in milliseconds) that the debezium-oracle component''s snapshotLockTimeoutMs option waits for table locks before aborting a snapshot, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The maximum duration that the "snapshotLockTimeoutMs" option in the "debezium-oracle" component waits for table locks before aborting a snapshot is 10 seconds (10000 milliseconds). This configuration option''s default value is also set to 10 seconds.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and the range of possible values for the "snapshotMaxThreads" option in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "snapshotMaxThreads" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component is an integer type property with a default value of 1. While not required, you can adjust its value to set the maximum number of threads used during snapshot process. This value can be within any positive integer range as defined by your application''s requirements or resources.'
    - question: 'What is the default snapshotMode for the Apache Camel''s debezium-oracle component and in what scenario will the connector run a snapshot that captures only the schema (table structures), but not any table data?'
      answer: |
       'The default snapshotMode for the Apache Camel''s debezium-oracle component is ''initial''. This mode causes the connector to run a snapshot that captures the current full state of the configured tables if it doesn''t detect any offsets for the logical server name. However, in case you want the connector to only capture the schema (table structures), but not any table data, you can set the snapshotMode to ''schema_only''. This option runs a snapshot that captures only the table structures without the actual data. This mode is useful when you wish to avoid capturing the existing table data while setting up the connector.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotData'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-oracle'', and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotData'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-oracle'' permits you to decide whether or not data should be snapshotted based on the configuration. When set as configuration_based, this mode allows for controlling data snapshotting. Its default value is false, meaning data snapshotting is turned off by default. This option is optional and not required when using the ''debezium-oracle'' component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the option "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnDataError" within the Apache Camel''s Debezium-Oracle component, when it comes to handling snapshotting data in case of error when ''snapshot.mode'' is set as configuration-based? Also, can the use of this option be omitted if not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The option "snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnDataError" within the Apache Camel''s Debezium-Oracle component is used to control snapshotting data in case of error when ''snapshot.mode'' is set as configuration-based. In this scenario, setting this option to true allows you to specify that a snapshot should be taken whenever an error occurs during data synchronization, while setting it to false indicates that snapshots will not be taken. However, it''s important to note that this option is optional; if not specified, the default value is false, which means snapshots will not be taken in case of error.'
    - question: 'Given the information provided, here''s a question related to the ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnSchemaError'' option for the Apache Camel component ''debezium-oracle'':              What does setting the ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnSchemaError'' option to true in the ''debezium-oracle'' component configuration mean, and how is it different from the default value?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotOnSchemaError'' option to true in the ''debezium-oracle'' component configuration means that when the ''snapshot.mode'' is set as configuration_based, it will allow you to explicitly choose to snapshot the schema in case of error. Unlike the default value (false), where the schema is not snapshotted if an error occurs during schema change capture.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotSchema'' option in the Apache Camel component named ''debezium-oracle'', if it is set as configuration_based for ''snapshot.mode'', and whether this setting is required to be specified?'
      answer: |
       'The ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedSnapshotSchema'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-oracle'', when set as configuration_based for ''snapshot.mode'', allows you to control whether or not the schema should be snapshotted. If it is not specified, the default value is false, which means that the schema will not be snapshotted. However, specifying this setting is optional.'
    - question: 'In relation to the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component, what does the optional property ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedStartStream'' determine, and could you provide an example of how to configure it when ''snapshot.mode'' is set as configuration-based?'
      answer: |
       'The optional property ''snapshotModeConfigurationBasedStartStream'' in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component determines whether a stream should start or not after a snapshot, specifically when ''snapshot.mode'' is configured to be based on settings. If set to true, it will instruct the stream to start, and false will prevent it from starting after the snapshot.              For instance, when you want to configure this property with ''snapshot.mode'' set as configuration-based, you could do so by setting both properties in the configuration of the Debezium Oracle component:              ```yaml       from("debezium-oracle")         .configureNoop()           .property("snapshot.mode", "configuration") // Set ''snapshot.mode'' to be configuration-based.           .property("snapshotModeConfigurationBasedStartStream", true) // Instruct the stream to start after snapshot.       ```'
    - question: 'What should be the value for the "snapshotModeCustomName" option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component if you wish to implement a custom snapshot mode, and how does this custom implementation work?'
      answer: |
       'If you wish to implement a custom snapshot mode for the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component, the value for the "snapshotModeCustomName" option should be the name of your custom implementation as returned by its ''name()'' method. This name is used to reference your class when it implements the ''Snapshotter'' interface. This custom implementation will be called during each application boot to decide whether a snapshot needs to be taken, based on the logic defined within your custom Snapshotter class.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the `snapshotSelectStatementOverrides` option in the Apache Camel debezium-oracle component to set a specific point to start (resume) snapshotting for large append-only tables, given that it''s a comma-separated list of table names and their respective select statements during snapshotting?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the `snapshotSelectStatementOverrides` option in the Apache Camel Debezium-Oracle component to set a specific point to start (resume) snapshotting for large append-only tables, you should define a comma-separated list of fully qualified table names followed by their respective select statements within the properties identified by the format `snapshot.select.statement.overrides.<DB_NAME>.<TABLE_NAME>` or `snapshot.select.statement.overrides.<SCHEMA_NAME>.<TABLE_NAME>`.              For instance, if you have a table named "SALES" in the schema "SHOP" in database "MYDATABASE", and you wish to resume snapshotting from a specific row with id greater than 10000, you would set the property as follows:              `snapshot.select.statement.overrides.MYDATABASE.SHOP.SALES=SELECT * FROM SHOP.SALES WHERE ID > 10000;`'
    - question: 'What is the effect of setting the "snapshotTablesOrderByRowCount" option to either ''descending'' or ''ascending'' when using the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle", and how does it compare to leaving this option disabled (default value)?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "snapshotTablesOrderByRowCount" option to ''descending'' or ''ascending'' when using the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" changes the order in which tables are processed during the initial snapshot. Specifically, choosing ''descending'' will cause the tables to be ordered by row count in descending order, meaning that larger tables get processed first. On the other hand, choosing ''ascending'' will cause the tables to be ordered by row count in ascending order, with smaller tables being processed first. If you leave this option disabled (which is the default value), the ordering of tables during the initial snapshot will not be affected by row counts. This means that the component will process the tables based on other factors such as table names or metadata, which may not necessarily prioritize larger tables.'
    - question: 'What is the default value or possible alternative values for the debezium-oracle option named "sourceinfoStructMaker" in Apache Camel, and is it required when using this component? (In your provided information, the defaultValue is io.debezium.connector.oracle.OracleSourceInfoStructMaker, but I would like to confirm if there are any other possible alternative values, and if the option can be omitted.)'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel when using the debezium-oracle component, the default value for the "sourceinfoStructMaker" option is io.debezium.connector.oracle.OracleSourceInfoStructMaker. While this option is not required, it''s used to specify the class that returns the SourceInfo schema and struct when using Debezium with Oracle databases. Other alternative values for this option are not explicitly specified in the information you provided, so it''s best to stick with the default value if you''re unsure.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value, if any, for the "tableExcludeList" option in the "debezium-oracle" component of Apache Camel when using it with Oracle database tables, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "tableExcludeList" option in the "debezium-oracle" component of Apache Camel for Oracle databases serves as a comma-separated list of regular expressions to exclude specific fully-qualified table names from monitoring. By default, no tables are excluded (the "defaultValue" is null). Whether to use this option is optional ("required": false) and it falls under the group of options related specifically to Oracle databases ("groups": "oracle").'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''tableIncludeList'' option in the Apache Camel component ''debezium-oracle'', and can it be specified as a required or default value? Additionally, where does this option fall under in terms of the groups defined for this component?'
      answer: |
       'The ''tableIncludeList'' option within the Apache Camel component ''debezium-oracle'' specifies the tables for which changes will be captured during database events. It can be set as an optional value, meaning it is not necessary to provide a value if all tables in your Oracle database are intended for tracking. The ''tableIncludeList'' option falls under the ''oracle'' group of options for this component.'
    - question: 'How does changing the `tombstonesOnDelete` option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component affect the handling of delete operations and what is the default behavior when this option is not explicitly set?'
      answer: |
       'When adjusting the `tombstonesOnDelete` option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component, you''re essentially deciding how delete operations should be represented within the Kafka stream. With `tombstonesOnDelete` set to true (its default value), deletions from the source database are reflected by both a delete event and a subsequent tombstone event in Kafka. This allows Kafka to fully delete all events associated with a particular key once the corresponding source record is deleted. Conversely, when `tombstonesOnDelete` is set to false, only a delete event will be emitted for each deletion operation without generating a corresponding tombstone event in Kafka. If this option is not explicitly set, the default behavior (emitting tombstone events) will apply.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and potential values (including custom options) of the "topicNamingStrategy" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component, and what is its purpose within this context?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "topicNamingStrategy" option in the Apache Camel Debezium Oracle component is "io.debezium.schema.SchemaTopicNamingStrategy". This option specifies the class that determines the name of Topics used for data change, schema change, transaction, and heartbeat events within this context. While the default value is a built-in strategy, it can also accept custom strategies as long as they implement the KafkaProducerConfig#TopicNameStrategy interface. The group associated with this option is "oracle".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and requirements of the "topicPrefix" option in the Apache Camel component called "debezium-oracle", specifically regarding alphanumeric characters, hyphens, dots, and underscores that can be used for this option? Additionally, does it have a default value and is it mandatory to provide a value when configuring this connector?'
      answer: |
       'The "topicPrefix" option in the Apache Camel component "debezium-oracle" serves a crucial purpose by identifying and providing a namespace for the specific database server/cluster that the connector is capturing changes from. Since it is used as a prefix for all Kafka topic names that receive events emitted by this connector, it''s essential that the topic prefix be unique across all other connectors to avoid any potential naming conflicts. Regarding the characters allowed, only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, dots, and underscores can be used for this option. It''s important to note that this option does not have a default value, meaning you must explicitly specify it when configuring the connector. Given its role in identifying your specific Kafka topics, the "topicPrefix" option is required, ensuring that you correctly route the data generated by the debezium-oracle component.'
    - question: 'What should be specified as the replacement for `__debezium_unavailable_value` in the "unavailableValuePlaceholder" option of the Apache Camel''s Debezium Oracle component to indicate that the original value is unavailable and not provided by the database, when this setting is optional?'
      answer: |
       'To indicate that the original value is unavailable and not provided by the database in the "unavailableValuePlaceholder" option of Apache Camel''s Debezium Oracle component, you can specify any constant value as a replacement for `__debezium_unavailable_value`. It is optional, so the default value `__debezium_unavailable_value` can be overridden if necessary.'
