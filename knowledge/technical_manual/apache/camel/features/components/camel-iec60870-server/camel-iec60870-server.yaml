    - question: 'What is the default value and type for the "defaultConnectionOptions" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, and can it be set as optional? (Answer: It has a default value of null, it is an object type, and it is set as optional)'
      answer: |
       'The "defaultConnectionOptions" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component has a default value of `null`, and it is of type `object`. This configuration can be set as optional since its usage is not mandatory.'
    - question: 'How does the `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component affect message handling when an exception occurs during consumption, and under what conditions is it possible to use this option?'
      answer: |
       'The `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component enables bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. When this option is set, any exceptions that occur while the consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages will be treated as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler. It is only possible to use this option if the 3rd party component supports notifying Camel about an exception being thrown; some components manage these exceptions internally only and `bridgeErrorHandler` would not apply. If `bridgeErrorHandler` is not used, the consumer will default to the Apache Camel''s built-in `ExceptionHandler`, which logs errors at WARN or ERROR level and ignores them.'
    - question: 'Here''s a question you could ask related to the Apache Camel component IEC60870-server''s "lazyStartProducer" option:              "When using the IEC60870-server component in an Apache Camel route, what advantage does setting the ''lazyStartProducer'' option to true provide, and what potential impact might this have on the processing time of messages?"'
      answer: |
       'Setting the ''lazyStartProducer'' option to true for the IEC60870-server component in Apache Camel offers an advantage by allowing the producer to start dynamically, only when the first message arrives. This is particularly useful in scenarios where initiating the producer may otherwise lead to a route failure during the startup phase. The benefit comes from the ability to handle production failures using Camel''s routing error handlers rather than causing the whole route to fail at startup.              However, there is a potential impact on processing time when you choose to start the producer lazily. Since creating and starting the producer may take some additional time, the overall processing time of each message might be prolonged because of this initialization step, especially for the first message processed in the route.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel component ''iec60870-server'' influence the configuration process, and is it required or optional to set this option during the component''s initialization? Furthermore, what is the default value of the ''autowiredEnabled'' option and which groups of configurations does it belong to in advanced settings?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel component ''iec60870-server'' allows for automatic autowiring, which streamlines the configuration process by automatically searching the registry to find a single instance of a matching type when it is marked as autowired. This feature is particularly useful for configuring components like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc., saving you manual setup time. It''s an optional setting during the component''s initialization, meaning that if left unspecified, its default value will be ''true''. The ''autowiredEnabled'' option falls under the ''advanced'' configuration groups.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value (if any) of the dataModuleOptions option under the dataModuleOptions group in the IEC60870-server component within Apache Camel?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel, the "dataModuleOptions" option under the "IEC60870-server" component serves as a placeholder for user-defined configurations related to Data Modules. It is an optional property (indicated by "required": false) with its default value being null ("defaultValue": null). These options are grouped together under the "common" category ("groups":"common"), suggesting they apply across multiple instances of the IEC60870-server component. Users can specify their desired configuration within this option for tailoring their data exchange processes according to individual application requirements.'
    - question: 'In relation to the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, what is the default behavior for the option ''filterNonExecute'' and when should it be set to false in a use case where non-execute requests are desired?'
      answer: |
       'In reference to the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, by default, the option ''filterNonExecute'' is set to true, meaning that all incoming requests which do not have the execute bit set will be filtered out. However, in a use case where non-execute requests are desired, this option should be set to false so that these requests will no longer be discarded.'
    - question: 'What are the available options or properties that can be configured under the "protocolOptions" of the Apache Camel IEC60870 server component when using an object type, if it is not required? (Assuming that this option allows additional settings for configuring communication protocol-specific details in the IEC60870 protocol.)'
      answer: |
       'When working with the "protocolOptions" of the Apache Camel IEC60870 server component, you may choose to configure various properties specific to the IEC60870 protocol if they are not required. Given that this option is of type "object", it allows you to specify different key-value pairs representing these protocol-specific details. However, since there''s no default value provided and it''s optional, these exact properties depend on the specific IEC60870 implementation you''re using. Consult your application''s documentation or contact the vendor for more detailed information about which properties are supported and how to configure them when using an object type for the "protocolOptions" in Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'Here is a possible question about the Apache Camel component iec60870-server option named bridgeErrorHandler:              "In what situations can the bridgeErrorHandler option of the IEC60870-Server component in Apache Camel be set to true? And when should it be left at its default value, false?"'
      answer: |
       'The `bridgeErrorHandler` option of the IEC60870-Server component in Apache Camel should be set to true when you wish to bridge the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This allows exceptions that may occur during the pickup of incoming messages by the consumer to be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.              However, it''s important to note that this is only possible if the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. Some components handle errors internally only, and in these cases, `bridgeErrorHandler` is not applicable. If your use case supports this functionality, you can enable it.              In situations where the component does not support exceptions being propagated or where you prefer the default behavior, the consumer will utilize the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler`. Exceptions will then be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored by default.'
    - question: 'What custom ExceptionHandler options can be specified when using the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, and how does this option interact with the bridgeErrorHandler option? Furthermore, what is the default behavior of the exceptionHandler if it''s not explicitly set by the consumer?'
      answer: |
       'When utilizing the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, you have the option to specify a custom ExceptionHandler to manage exceptions that occur during runtime. However, if the bridgeErrorHandler is enabled, this option for the custom ExceptionHandler will not be in effect as it takes over exception handling. By default, if no explicit custom ExceptionHandler is set by the consumer, the component will log exceptions with a level of WARN or ERROR and ignore them. This behavior falls under the "consumer (advanced)" group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "exchangePattern" option within the Apache Camel component "iec60870-server" and what group does this configuration belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "exchangePattern" option within the Apache Camel component "iec60870-server" is null. This configuration belongs to the advanced consumer group.'
    - question: 'Here is a question related to the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component:              What is the purpose of setting the "lazyStartProducer" option to true when using the IEC60870-server component in Apache Camel? Could you explain how it affects the starting and handling of production failures during routing messages, as well as its impact on overall processing time? Also, could you clarify whether it is required or optional and if it has any default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component allows for delaying the start of the producer until the first message arrives. This can be beneficial when you anticipate that initiating the producer during startup may potentially cause failures, leading to route failure. By deferring the startup to a lazy approach, such failures can be managed through Camel''s routing error handlers, enabling the routes and CamelContext to successfully start up.              When processing the first message, creating and starting the producer will take some time, which may prolong overall processing time slightly. However, it ensures that the application starts reliably under adverse conditions.              Regarding your query, the "lazyStartProducer" option is an optional configuration; you can set it to false by default if desired. It belongs to the "producer (advanced)" group in Camel''s component configuration options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel `acknowledgeWindow` option in the `iec60870-server` component and what is its default value, data type, whether it is required or not, and which configuration group does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The "acknowledgeWindow" option in the Apache Camel `iec60870-server` component functions as the Acknowledgment window parameter W. This value defines the period within which an acknowledgement of received messages must be expected by the server. Its default value is 10, and it falls under the integer data type. Although it''s not a required option, meaning you can use the component without setting its value, if provided it belongs to the ''connection'' configuration group.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible valid options for the "adsuAddressType" option within the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, and is specifying this option when setting up a connection required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s IEC60870-server component, the "adsuAddressType" option does not have a default value and can be either SIZE_1 or SIZE_2. This option pertains to the common ASDU address size within your communication setup. Specifying this option when setting up a connection is optional as it may not be required in all situations, falling under the "groups" category of "connection".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the "causeOfTransmissionType" option within the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, and can it be considered as a required configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "causeOfTransmissionType" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component is designed to specify the cause of transmission type, which may be either SIZE_1 or SIZE_2. This attribute is optional, meaning it''s not required for configuration but can be provided if needed, belonging to the "connection" group. By default, it has no preset value.'
    - question: 'What are the valid values for the option "informationObjectAddressType" in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, and is it optional to set a value for this option? The possible values include SIZE_1, SIZE_2 or SIZE_3, and it can be set as not required.'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s IEC60870-server component, the valid values for the "informationObjectAddressType" option are SIZE_1, SIZE_2, or SIZE_3. It is not mandatory to provide a value for this option, as it can be set as optional within the component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum number of un-acknowledged IEC60870 messages that can be handled by an Apache Camel server component before acknowledgement, given that its default value is 15 and it''s an optional configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The maximum number of un-acknowledged IEC60870 messages that can be handled by an Apache Camel server component before acknowledgement, when this configuration is left at its default value, is 15. However, it''s important to note that the "maxUnacknowledged" option for the IEC60870-server component in Apache Camel is optional, meaning you can change or leave this value as it suits your specific use case.'
    - question: 'What is the default value, data type, and whether it is required for the option ''timeout1'' within the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, if it is provided in a connection setting?'
      answer: |
       'The ''timeout1'' option within the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component has a default value of 15000 milliseconds (or 15 seconds), which is an integer data type. It is not required, meaning that if this value is not provided in a connection setting, it will default to 15000 milliseconds.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the optional timeout2 setting in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, and in what context does it function within the connection group? (Default Value: 10000, Data Type: Integer)'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional timeout2 setting in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component is an integer of 10000 milliseconds. This setting functions within the context of the connection group, controlling the timeout duration for certain operations related to this component''s connections.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type (if not specified, the default value applies) of the optional timeout3 configuration option when using the Apache Camel iec60870-server component for setting a timeout in milliseconds within the connection group?'
      answer: |
       'The default data type for the optional timeout3 configuration in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component is an integer, and its default value is 20000 milliseconds (or 20 seconds). Since this option is set within the connection group and marked as "optional", you may choose to customize the timeout value if needed, while keeping the original setting for instances where you do not specify it.'
    - question: 'How is the behavior of the "causeSourceAddress" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component determined when this option is not explicitly set or provided with a value? Does it default to including or excluding the source address?'
      answer: |
       'When the "causeSourceAddress" option is not explicitly set or provided with a value in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, its behavior does not include the source address by default. The "defaultValue": null indicates that no specific action is taken when this option is absent or unset, and hence, it defaults to excluding the source address.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the optional timeout setting ("connectionTimeout") within the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, when configuring a client connection? Also, could you explain what this option does in relation to the establishment of a connected connection?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, the default value for the optional timeout setting ("connectionTimeout") is an integer type with the value 10000 milliseconds (or 10 seconds). This option controls the duration for which the server waits for a client to establish a connected connection. If a client does not connect within the specified time, the connection attempt will fail and no further action will be taken until another attempt is initiated.'
    - question: 'How does setting the "ignoreBackgroundScan" option within the Apache Camel IEC60870-Server component to false impact the handling of background scan transmissions in comparison to when it is set to its default value, true?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the "ignoreBackgroundScan" option within the Apache Camel IEC60870-Server component to false allows the handling of background scan transmissions to be enabled. This means that background scan messages will no longer be ignored when set to this value, and they will be processed in accordance with your application''s logic, unlike when it is set to its default value, true, where such transmissions are ignored and not handled.'
    - question: 'Here''s a question that can be answered based on the information provided:              "What is the default setting for the ''ignoreDaylightSavingTime'' option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component and under what circumstances would changing this value from its default be necessary?"'
      answer: |
       'The default setting for the ''ignoreDaylightSavingTime'' option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component is false, meaning that it respects Daylight Saving Time (DST). However, you may choose to change this value to true if you want to ignore DST. Changing this value from its default might be necessary when dealing with systems or applications that do not account for DST changes, ensuring consistent timestamp handling across your system.'
    - question: 'What is the valid time zone format that can be used for the optional "timeZone" configuration parameter in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, and what is its default value?'
      answer: |
       'The valid time zone format that can be used for the optional "timeZone" configuration parameter in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component is any Java timezone string. Its default value is UTC.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "connectionId" option for the Apache Camel IEC60870-Server component, and is it required or optional? (Hint: It is a string, and when provided, it groups connection instances.)'
      answer: |
       'The "connectionId" option for the Apache Camel IEC60870-Server component is an identifier that groups multiple connection instances. Its default value is null, which means one will need to provide a custom string for this field if they want to group connections intentionally. This attribute is optional since it''s not mandatory to assign a specific group identity to every connection instance.'
