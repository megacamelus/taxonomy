    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the "defaultConnectionOptions" option within the Apache Camel "iec60870-server" component, if it is not provided explicitly during configuration? Also, are there any specific groups that this option belongs to in terms of the component''s configuration structure?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "defaultConnectionOptions" option within the Apache Camel "iec60870-server" component is null. The data type for this option is an object. This option falls under the "common" groups in terms of the component''s configuration structure.'
    - question: 'How can you configure the IEC60870-server component in Apache Camel so that exceptions occurring during message pickup are bridged to the routing Error Handler instead of being logged and ignored by default? Is it possible to achieve this with the bridgeErrorHandler option, and if so, how do we set it up? If not, when might this feature become available in future releases?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the IEC60870-server component in Apache Camel so that exceptions occurring during message pickup are bridged to the routing Error Handler, you can use the "bridgeErrorHandler" option. This allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, meaning any exceptions will be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. To set it up, simply add the "bridgeErrorHandler=true" parameter in your route configuration for the IEC60870-server component.              However, this is only possible if the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. Some components handle exceptions internally and therefore bridgeErrorHandler may not be possible in those instances. In such situations, we might improve the Camel component to hook into the 3rd party component and make this possible for future releases. By default, the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, which are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.'
    - question: 'What is the function of the "lazyStartProducer" option in an Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, and what are its potential benefits and drawbacks when set to true (i.e., enabled)?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870 server component allows you to defer the starting of a producer until the first message is processed. This can be useful in situations where the producer may fail during startup, causing the entire route to fail as well. By enabling lazy start, such failure can be handled dynamically during message routing through Camel''s error handlers, resulting in a more robust system.              However, it''s important to note that when "lazyStartProducer" is set to true, the initial processing time might be prolonged as creating and starting the producer may take some time. This could potentially impact overall performance of the processing, especially for high-throughput scenarios. Therefore, careful consideration should be given before enabling this option, weighing the benefits of error handling against potential performance implications.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, and can it be configured to disable autowiring?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component is a boolean setting that determines whether autowiring is enabled. By default, it is set to true, meaning autowiring is activated. This feature allows for automatic configuration of components such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, and more, by looking up in the registry to find a single instance of matching type. If you wish to disable autowiring, you can do so by setting this option to false, though it is only recommended for advanced users as it may impact the automatic configuration of your application.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "dataModuleOptions" option within the "iec60870-server" component in Apache Camel, and is it required to be set when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "dataModuleOptions" option within the "iec60870-server" component in Apache Camel is an object type that provides configuration options for the data module, specifically designed for the IEC60870 protocol server. By default, it has no predefined value (defaultValue: null). Whether you need to set this option depends on your specific use case and requirements as it''s optional ("required": false). The group of this option is "common", implying that it can be used with other components sharing the same common configuration options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "filterNonExecute" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, and is it required for use?'
      answer: |
       'The "filterNonExecute" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component is designed to filter out all requests that do not have the execute bit set. This means it will only process requests where the execute action is requested. By default, this option is set to true, allowing for optional use. If you choose not to utilize it, the server will still process all incoming requests regardless of the execute bit.'
    - question: 'What are the valid options for configuring the ProtocolOptions in the Apache Camel IEC60870-Server component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for these options when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "ProtocolOptions" in the Apache Camel IEC60870-Server component are configurable properties related to the communication protocol. They are optional, meaning you don''t necessarily need to provide a value for them when using this component. However, the default value is null. The specific options and their respective uses can be found within the "common" groups section of your configuration settings.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component affect exception handling, and when is it recommended to use this feature compared to the default behavior?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component allows for bridging exceptions that occur during message pickup by the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that instead of ignoring or logging exceptions at WARN or ERROR level, they will be processed as messages and handled by the routing Error Handler. It''s recommended to use this feature when your 3rd party component allows Camel to be notified if an exception was thrown. However, some components may handle exceptions internally, in which case using "bridgeErrorHandler" is not possible. If this option isn''t available or suitable, the consumer will default to using the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler for exception handling.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the exceptionHandler option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, when it should be used, if it has a default value, and what groups does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The `exceptionHandler` option within the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component allows a user to implement a custom ExceptionHandler. This can be beneficial when dealing with specific error conditions that require custom handling logic. However, if the `bridgeErrorHandler` option is enabled, the `exceptionHandler` will not be in use. By default, exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level will be handled by Camel components without a specified exception handler. The `exceptionHandler` belongs to the advanced consumer group (groups: "consumer (advanced)") and may require more specialized knowledge to utilize effectively.'
    - question: 'What is the default setting for the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, and what group of configuration options does it belong to when using an advanced consumer setup?'
      answer: |
       'The default setting for the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component is null, meaning there is no predefined value. This option can be found under the "consumer (advanced)" group of configuration options when setting up an advanced consumer configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, and under what circumstances might it be beneficial to enable this feature?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component is designed to allow deferred startup of a producer, preventing the initial failure of routes due to issues during starting the producer. This can be beneficial when the producer may fail during the startup process and cause the entire route to fail as well.              In situations where the producer''s startup might cause issues that could be handled by Camel''s routing error handlers, setting "lazyStartProducer" to true can help ensure a successful startup of the CamelContext and routes. However, it''s important to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time, which could prolong the overall processing time of the system.              By default, this option is set to false, but enabling it for specific producers can be part of your CamelContext configuration under the "producer (advanced)" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "acknowledgeWindow" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, and is it a required configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "acknowledgeWindow" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component serves as a Parameter W - Acknowledgment window. This parameter defines the number of messages that can be sent before an acknowledgement is expected from the remote device. In its default configuration, the acknowledgeWindow has a value of 10. It is important to note that this option is not required for the component''s operation; it may be configured if needed within the specified "connection" groups.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible values for the "adsuAddressType" option within the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, and is it required when configuring a connection?'
      answer: |
       'The "adsuAddressType" option within the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component does not have a default value. It can take either of two values: SIZE_1 or SIZE_2, which represent the common ASDU address size for communication. Using this option is optional when configuring a connection in Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the possible value for the "causeOfTransmissionType" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, and is it required to be set explicitly or does it have a default value?'
      answer: |
       'The "causeOfTransmissionType" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component can take one of two values: SIZE_1 or SIZE_2. It is not required to be set explicitly as it has a default value of null.'
    - question: 'What are the valid values for the "informationObjectAddressType" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component and what is its purpose, considering that it may be either SIZE_1, SIZE_2 or SIZE_3, and it''s optional?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s IEC60870-server component, the "informationObjectAddressType" option can take values of SIZE_1, SIZE_2, or SIZE_3. This option is associated with the size of an information address. The purpose of this parameter is to specify how large the information object''s address should be when communicating within the IEC60870-5 protocol. It''s worth noting that this property is optional and does not have a default value.'
    - question: 'What is the maximum value for the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component''s "maxUnacknowledged" option, and what is its default value if this parameter is not specified in the configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The maximum value for the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component''s "maxUnacknowledged" option is not specified in the information provided. However, its default value is 15 if this parameter is not specified in the configuration. This parameter represents the maximum number of un-acknowledged messages.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the optional timeout1 option in the Apache Camel component IEC60870-server, and for what group of configuration options does it belong?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional timeout1 option in the Apache Camel component IEC60870-server is an integer type with a value of 15000 milliseconds. This option belongs to the connection group of configuration options.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the timeout2 option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component and can it be configured as optional? In other words, is it required or can it be set to a different value if desired?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the timeout2 option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component is 10000 milliseconds (or 10 seconds). It should be noted that this option can be configured as optional, meaning it can be set to a different value if desired or left unspecified. The timeout2 parameter is associated with the "connection" group within the component''s settings.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the optional timeout3 parameter in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, and under what group can it be configured?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the optional timeout3 parameter in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component is an integer value of 20000 milliseconds (or 20 seconds). Regarding its data type, timeout3 is an integer. This configuration option can be found under the "connection" group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''causeSourceAddress'' option in the Apache Camel component ''iec60870-server'', and does it have a default value, or is its inclusion optional?'
      answer: |
       'The ''causeSourceAddress'' option in the Apache Camel component ''iec60870-server'' determines whether to include the source address in the data being transmitted. This option has an optional inclusion as indicated by the default value being null.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type of the "connectionTimeout" option within the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "connectionTimeout" option within the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component has a default value of 10000 (milliseconds) and is an integer data type. It''s an optional setting as indicated by the "required": false property. This option specifies the timeout in millis to wait for a client to establish a connected connection.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "ignoreBackgroundScan" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, and can it be configured as required?'
      answer: |
       'The "ignoreBackgroundScan" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component is a boolean value that determines whether background scan transmissions should be ignored by default. Its default value is true, meaning the background scans are ignored by the server. However, it can be configured as needed within your application since it''s not a required setting, belonging to the data group of options.'
    - question: 'How does one configure the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component to ignore Daylight Saving Time (DST) when communicating with an IEC 60870-5-104 device?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component to ignore Daylight Saving Time (DST) when communicating with an IEC 60870-5-104 device, you can set the "ignoreDaylightSavingTime" option to true. This is achieved by modifying the configuration as follows:              ```       iec60870Server.ignoreDaylightSavingTime = true;       ```              By default, this option is set to false, meaning that DST will be respected. Setting it to true allows the IEC60870-server component to communicate with the device as if DST does not apply.'
    - question: 'What is the default time zone for the "timeZone" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component, and can this option be marked as required or must it be provided when configuring the server? (The description suggests that it may be any Java time zone string.)'
      answer: |
       'The default timezone for the "timeZone" option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-server component is UTC. However, this option can be set to any valid Java timezone string; you are not required to provide it when configuring the server, but its absence will use the default value of UTC.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the `connectionId` option in the Apache Camel IEC60870-Server component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s IEC60870-Server component, the `connectionId` option serves as an identifier for grouping connection instances. It does not have a default value, meaning you will need to provide one when setting up your connections. The usage of `connectionId` is optional; it''s not necessarily required in every connection setup.'
