    - question: 'How does the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel hazelcast-map component function, and under which conditions would it not be possible to use this feature?'
      answer: |
       'The `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel Hazelcast-Map component allows for bridging exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means any exceptions will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. However, this feature is only possible if the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. If the component handles exceptions internally only, then `bridgeErrorHandler` is not possible. In such cases, we may improve the Camel component to hook into the 3rd party component for future releases to make this feature available. By default, the consumer uses the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, which are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored if `bridgeErrorHandler` is not used.'
    - question: 'How does configuring the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Hazelcast-Map component affect the behavior of a Camel route, and under what circumstances might it be beneficial to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'Configuring the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel Hazelcast-Map component allows you to defer the startup of the producer until the first message is processed. This can be beneficial when a producer may otherwise fail during the startup of the route, causing the entire route to fail as well. By setting this option to true, you allow the CamelContext and routes to start up without issues, and handle the producer startup failure during routing messages through Camel''s error handlers. However, keep in mind that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some additional time, which could prolong the total processing time of the route.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel Hazelcast-Map component, and under what circumstances would setting it to false be necessary?'
      answer: |
       'The ''autowiredEnabled'' option in the Apache Camel Hazelcast-Map component is a boolean setting that determines whether autowiring is enabled for automatic configuration of various services like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, etc. Its default value is true, meaning autowiring is enabled by default. However, setting it to false would be necessary if you wish to manually configure these services instead of letting the component automatically find and use a single instance of matching type from the registry. This option falls under the ''advanced'' group in the configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "hazelcastInstance" option in the Apache Camel component "hazelcast-map", and is it required?'
      answer: |
       'The "hazelcastInstance" option in the Apache Camel component "hazelcast-map" serves as a reference to the Hazelcast instance, which can be used for connecting to the Hazelcast endpoint. If you don''t explicitly provide an instance reference, Camel uses the default Hazelcast instance from the camel-hazelcast instance. The default value for this option is null, meaning no default instance is set. This option is not required, and it falls under the "advanced" group of configuration options in Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the default hazelcastMode for Apache Camel''s hazelcast-map component and what options are available if I want to specify a different mode?'
      answer: |
       'The default hazelcastMode for Apache Camel''s hazelcast-map component is "node". If you wish to use a different mode, you can specify it as an option when configuring the component. The available modes are determined by the Hazelcast instance you are using, and the options will vary accordingly. These advanced settings are grouped under "advanced" in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "defaultOperation" option in the Apache Camel hazelcast-map component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "defaultOperation" option in the Apache Camel Hazelcast-Map component serves to specify a default operation to be used if no operation header has been provided. Its default value is null, meaning no default operation is set by default. This option is optional, as indicated by the "required: false" property in its definition. It falls under the common group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the `hazelcastConfigUri` option in the Apache Camel `hazelcast-map` component, and is its use mandatory or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The `hazelcastConfigUri` option in the Apache Camel `hazelcast-map` component serves as a placeholder for the Hazelcast configuration file. Its default value is null. The usage of this option is optional, meaning you can provide it if you want to use a custom Hazelcast configuration file, but if not provided, the component will use its default settings. This option falls under the common group of options in the context of using the `hazelcast-map` component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "hazelcastInstance" option in the Apache Camel''s hazelcast-map component, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "hazelcastInstance" option in Apache Camel''s hazelcast-map component serves as a reference to a running Hazelcast instance, which can be utilized for establishing connections to Hazelcast endpoints. This option is not mandatory, meaning it has no default value and its usage is optional within the context of this component. The "hazelcastInstance" group in which it resides indicates that it''s part of a common set of properties related to the Hazelcast configuration when using the hazelcast-map component in Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "hazelcastInstanceName" option in the Apache Camel''s "hazelcast-map" component, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "hazelcastInstanceName" option within the Apache Camel''s "hazelcast-map" component serves as a reference name for your Hazelcast instance. It can be used in defining the Hazelcast endpoint. If you do not specify an instance reference, Camel will utilize the default Hazelcast instance from the camel-hazelcast instance. The default value for "hazelcastInstanceName" is null. Providing a value for this option is optional.'
    - question: 'How does the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel Hazelcast-map component enable exception handling, and under what conditions might it be necessary to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel Hazelcast-map component enables exception handling by allowing exceptions (if supported by the third-party component) that occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages to be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. This is particularly useful when the 3rd party component allows Camel to be notified if an exception was thrown, and it''s necessary to set this option to true in such cases. If the third-party component cannot provide this capability, the consumer will use the default ExceptionHandler instead. It''s important to note that this functionality may be improved for future releases to better integrate with more components.'
    - question: 'How can you configure a custom ExceptionHandler for the Apache Camel Hazelcast-Map component when using it as a consumer, and what is the behavior of the component if the provided ExceptionHandler is not used?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom ExceptionHandler for the Apache Camel Hazelcast-Map component when using it as a consumer, you can set the "exceptionHandler" option to an object that implements your desired exception handling logic. However, if the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled, this option will not be in use as the component will handle exceptions itself. By default, the component will log exceptions at WARN or ERROR level and ignore them if no custom ExceptionHandler is provided. This configurationgroup falls under "consumer (advanced)".'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel Hazelcast-Map component when using it within the context of a consumer, specifically in terms of its role in creating an exchange?'
      answer: |
       'The "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel Hazelcast-Map component, when used within the context of a consumer, has no default value. Its purpose is to set the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. This option allows you to control how the consumer interacts with the exchange, influencing the flow of messages and data through your application. It''s important to note that this option is considered advanced, belonging to the "consumer (advanced)" group in the Hazelcast-Map component.'
    - question: 'How does the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component Hazelcast-Map impact the startup behavior, and when is it useful to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component Hazelcast-Map allows you to defer the start of a producer until the first message is processed. This can be beneficial in situations where starting the producer may cause issues during the initial startup of the CamelContext or routes, potentially causing the route to fail. By setting "lazyStartProducer" to true, you allow the startup failure to be handled via Camel''s routing error handlers. However, it is important to note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take some additional time, which could prolong the total processing time of the processing. This option falls under the "producer (advanced)" group in the component configuration.'
