    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "applicationName" option within the Apache Camel component "google-sheets"? Can this option be considered as an optional parameter, given its default value and the information that it represents a Google Sheets application name?'
      answer: |
       'The "applicationName" option within the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" is an optional parameter that represents the name of your Google Sheets application. Its default value is null, meaning that you can provide this information if you wish to specify a particular application, but if omitted, it will use whatever application is currently active or default. As mentioned in its description, a valid example of an application name could be camel-google-sheets/1.0.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component called "google-sheets"? Also, is it a required field and what type of data should be provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option within the Apache Camel component named "google-sheets" serves as a placeholder for the Client ID of your Google Sheets application. This value is optional, meaning you don''t have to provide it if you''re not using a specific client ID. By default, this field has no preset value. When providing data, ensure that you input a string type value.'
    - question: 'What is the format and contents of the optional "shared configuration" object when using the Apache Camel Google Sheets component? Is it necessary to provide this option if I don''t want to use a shared configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "shared configuration" option for the Apache Camel Google Sheets component is an optional, configurable object. If you wish to use a shared configuration, the format of this object would be an object containing no default value (as specified by the `defaultValue: null`). However, providing this option is not necessary if you do not intend to utilize a shared configuration. It belongs to the common group of options in the component''s configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component Google Sheets, and is it required? (Answer: The delegate option in the Google Sheets component for Apache Camel is used to specify a wide-domain service account. It has no default value and is optional.)'
      answer: |
       'The "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Sheets allows you to specify a wide-domain service account. This option has no default value and is optional.'
    - question: 'What specific Google Sheets API scopes can be specified when using the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" and how does one provide multiple scopes if they need to grant more than one permission level?'
      answer: |
       'When utilizing the Apache Camel component "google-sheets", you have the option to specify the Google Sheets API scopes, which determine the level of permissions an application has to a user account. To provide multiple scopes if you need to grant more than one permission level, simply separate them by commas. For comprehensive information about available scopes and their descriptions, please refer to the Google Scopes documentation at https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel google-sheets component affect error handling compared to its default setting, and under what conditions is it possible for this option to be used?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel Google-Sheets component allows for errors that occur while the consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages to be processed as regular messages and handled by the routing Error Handler, instead of being logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored by default. However, this is only possible if the third-party component supports Camel''s ability to be alerted about exceptions thrown. If a component handles exceptions internally and does not allow for this integration, bridgeErrorHandler may not be possible. In situations where the Camel component can hook into the third-party component, this feature may become available in future releases.'
    - question: 'How does setting the boolean option "splitResult" of the Apache Camel Google Sheets component to false affect the behavior of the component when consuming an array or collection from a Google Sheet?'
      answer: |
       'Setting the boolean option "splitResult" of the Apache Camel Google Sheets component to false means that the component will not generate a separate exchange for each element in the array or collection returned from a Google Sheet. Instead, it will use a single exchange for the entire list or array, executing the routes only once for all items combined.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets", and can it be set to true to delay the start-up of the producer until the first message arrives?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option within the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" allows you to defer the startup of a producer until the first message is processed. This can be beneficial in situations where the initial start-up of the producer might fail, causing the entire route to fail during startup. By starting the producer lazily, such startup failures can be handled through Camel''s routing error handlers. However, keep in mind that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take additional time, potentially increasing the overall processing duration for that message. The default value of "lazyStartProducer" is false. You can set it to true if you want to delay the start-up of the producer as described above.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the autowiredEnabled option in the Apache Camel google-sheets component affect its behavior, and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the `autowiredEnabled` option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component allows for automatic configuration of various services such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS clients, and more. When set to true (its default value), this option makes it possible for the component to look up a single instance of matching type in the registry, effectively automating the configuration process for these services. If you do not need this functionality, you can leave the option as false, but it''s essential to note that this feature is considered advanced and may not be necessary for basic use cases.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" to utilize the GoogleSheetsClientFactory as a factory for creating the client, and what are the available options if I choose to use this custom factory?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" to utilize the GoogleSheetsClientFactory as a factory for creating the client, you can do so by setting the option "clientFactory" when defining your route. Here''s an example of how to do it:              ```xml       from("google-sheets:myRoute")           .component(new GoogleSheetsComponent())               .GoogleSheetsClientFactory();       ```              In this example, the `GoogleSheetsComponent` is initialized with a custom factory `GoogleSheetsClientFactory`. By default, it will use `BatchGoogleSheetsClientFactory`, but you can provide your own implementation if needed.              Please note that the "clientFactory" option is part of the advanced settings group, and its usage might not be required in all cases. For more information about the available options and customizations for this factory, refer to the specific documentation related to GoogleSheetsClientFactory.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and recommended practice for using the ''accessToken'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-sheets'', and is it required when setting up this component?'
      answer: |
       'The ''accessToken'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-sheets'' is an OAuth 2 access token provided to authenticate your application with Google Sheets API. While its use is not required, it''s highly recommended for secure communication. However, since this token typically expires after an hour, it''s advisable to use ''refreshToken'' for long-term usage. The ''accessToken'' falls under the security group of options in Camel component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets", and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" serves as the secret key that authenticates your application with Google Sheets API. Its default value is null, meaning you need to provide your own client secret. This option is not required but highly recommended for security purposes, falling under the "security" group of settings in the configuration.'
    - question: 'How can I set or provide a refresh token for the OAuth 2 authentication in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component to ensure that the accessToken is renewed when it expires, if this component is intended for long-lived applications?'
      answer: |
       'To set or provide a refresh token for the OAuth 2 authentication in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component for long-lived applications, you can configure the "refreshToken" option. This option allows the component to obtain a new accessToken whenever the current one expires. You can do this by setting the value for the "refreshToken" field within your configuration group under security. If no default refresh token is provided, the component will not automatically renew the accessToken.'
    - question: 'How is a .json file containing the service account credentials for the Apache Camel Google Sheets component specified, if it is not required and there is no default value provided?'
      answer: |
       'The `.json` file containing the Service Account credentials for the Apache Camel Google Sheets component can be specified using the "serviceAccountKey" option within your configuration settings. Although this option is marked as "required: false", you can still provide it with a string value pointing to the location of your credential file, should you choose to do so, under the security group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets"? Also, is it a required option or can it be omitted if not provided? Lastly, where does this option fall within the grouping of options for the "google-sheets" component?'
      answer: |
       'The "applicationName" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" is intended to specify the Google Sheets application name, such as camel-google-sheets/1.0. This value is optional, meaning it can be omitted if not provided. It falls under the grouping of common options for the "google-sheets" component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the "clientId" option in the Apache Camel''s "google-sheets" component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option in Apache Camel''s "google-sheets" component serves as the Client ID of the Google Sheets application. It is a string type but does not have a default value. This means that you will need to provide your own Client ID when using this component, although it is not mandatory and can be left empty if you don''t require it.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets", and is it required?'
      answer: |
       'The "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" is intended for delegating access to a wide-domain service account. This option has no default value, meaning you need to provide a string value if you wish to use it. Whether it''s required or not depends on your specific use case; it''s optional and can be left unspecified.'
    - question: 'How can you utilize the "inBody" option within the Apache Camel "google-sheets" component to pass parameters as part of the message body?'
      answer: |
       'To utilize the "inBody" option within the Apache Camel "google-sheets" component, you can set a parameter name in the exchange body by defining it as an optional string ("type":"string", "required":false) under the "common" group ("groups":"common"). This allows you to pass parameters as part of the message body when using the Google Sheets component. For instance, you can write your route like this:              ```xml       from("google-sheets://your_spreadsheet_url?inBody=parameterName")           .process(exchange -> {...});       ```              In this example, replace `"your_spreadsheet_url"` with the URL of your Google Spreadsheet, and `"parameterName"` is the name you''d like to pass as a parameter in the exchange body. Now, you can set the value for "parameterName" by using `exchange.getIn().setBody("yourParameterValue")` in the processing block.'
    - question: 'What are the possible values or sets of values for the "scopes" option when using the Apache Camel component ''google-sheets'', and what does it mean for the level of permissions a sheets application will have on a user account? Also, is it mandatory to specify any value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'When utilizing the Apache Camel component ''google-sheets'', the "scopes" option specifies the level of permissions you want a Google Sheets application to have to a user account. The possible values or sets of values for this option are detailed at https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes. Multiple scopes can be separated by commas. For example, ''https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets'' grants read and write access to Google Sheets. It is not mandatory to specify a value for the "scopes" option, but if none is provided, the application will have minimal access to user data by default.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component affect its behavior when no files are polled during the idle period, and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component allows it to send an empty message (no body) if no files were polled during the idle period. By default, this option is set to false, meaning that no empty message will be sent when there are no polled files.'
    - question: 'What happens when the `splitResult` option in the Apache Camel''s Google Sheets component is set to true, and what should be done if it is not necessary to split the result into multiple exchanges?'
      answer: |
       'When you set the `splitResult` option in Apache Camel''s Google Sheets component to true, each element of an array or collection will trigger a separate exchange, causing the specified routes to execute for each individual exchange. If it is not necessary to split the result into multiple exchanges (for instance, when dealing with a single collection item), you can set this value to false, which will use a single exchange for the entire list or array instead.'
    - question: 'How does the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component function, and under what conditions can it be configured to utilize the routing Error Handler for exceptions that occur during message pickup by the consumer? Additionally, is there a default ExceptionHandler when this option is not used or set to false?'
      answer: |
       'The bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component enables bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler. This means that any exceptions that may occur while the Camel consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages will be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. However, this functionality is only possible if the third-party component allows Camel to be notified of an exception being thrown. If the component manages exceptions internally, bridgeErrorHandler cannot be configured. In cases where the component can be modified to allow this connection in future releases, it may become available. By default, when bridgeErrorHandler is not used or set to false, the consumer will utilize the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to manage exceptions, with these being logged at WARN or ERROR level and then ignored.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom ExceptionHandler for the Apache Camel Google Sheets component when using the `google-sheets` option, and what happens if the default value of this option is not set or if the `bridgeErrorHandler` option is enabled?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom ExceptionHandler for the Apache Camel Google Sheets component when using the "google-sheets" option, you can use the "exceptionHandler" option. However, if the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled, then this option will not be in effect. By default, exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level will be handled by the consumer and ignored. If the default value of the "exceptionHandler" option is not set, the consumer will handle exceptions as described above.'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets", and is it mandatory to provide a value when configuring a consumer for this component?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "exchangePattern" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" is null, meaning no default exchange pattern is set. Providing a value for this option when configuring a consumer for this component is not mandatory, but it can be specified if desired, and falls under the advanced group of configurations labeled as "consumer (advanced)".'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "pollStrategy" option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component, and what type of custom implementation can be provided for it to control error handling before an Exchange has been created and routed in Camel?'
      answer: |
       'The "pollStrategy" option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component is designed to allow customization of the polling strategy used during data retrieval. This pluggable option enables you to provide your own implementation of `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy`. This custom implementation can be used to control error handling that typically occurs during the poll operation, before an Exchange has been created and routed in Camel. This level of customization provides flexibility for managing unique error scenarios specific to your use case within the integration pipeline.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets", and under what circumstances would it be beneficial to set this option to true?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" allows you to defer the startup of a producer until the first message is processed. This can be useful when a producer may otherwise fail during the starting phase, causing the entire route to fail. By setting this option to true, you can handle such startup failures using Camel''s routing error handlers during message processing. However, be aware that the initial processing of messages may take slightly longer due to the creation and start-up time of the producer. This option is considered advanced and its group is "producer (advanced)".'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-sheets"?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel component named "google-sheets" is an integer that determines the number of subsequent error polls (failures due to some error) which should occur before the "backoffMultipler" should activate. By default, this value is not set, allowing you to configure it according to your specific use case needs. This option plays a crucial role in the scheduler group, helping manage retry strategies for operations that encounter errors when interacting with Google Sheets.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel "google-sheets" component, and is it required or optional when using this component, as well as under what group does it fall within the configuration?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffIdleThreshold" option in the Apache Camel "google-sheets" component is an integer value that specifies the number of subsequent idle polls that should occur before the backoffMultipler kicks in. This means it controls how many times a job will wait without any activity before the next attempt to handle it increases exponentially (as controlled by the backoffMultipler). The default value for this option is null, which implies no specific number if not explicitly set. It''s an optional configuration item, as indicated by the "required": false in its properties. This option falls under the "scheduler" group within the component''s configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the Apache Camel component google-sheets'' "backoffMultiplier" option, when it should be used in conjunction with "backoffIdleThreshold" and/or "backoffErrorThreshold", and what is its default value and data type?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffMultiplier" option for the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" is designed to allow the scheduled polling consumer to pause or back off if there have been a specified number of idle or error occurrences in a row. The value assigned to this option represents the number of polls that will be skipped before the next attempt is made again, effectively slowing down the rate at which it tries to connect after encountering issues.              It''s important to note that when using "backoffMultiplier", the options "backoffIdleThreshold" and/or "backoffErrorThreshold" must also be configured. These options define the number of idle or error events before backoff is initiated, respectively.              The default value for the "backoffMultiplier" option is null, which means it does not have a predefined value when the component is initialized. Its data type is an integer, indicating that only numerical values are valid for this configuration option.              This group of options belongs to the scheduler in the context of the Apache Camel component "google-sheets".'
    - question: 'What is the default value for the "delay" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets", and is it required when using this option? Additionally, what type of data does this option accept and which group does it belong to (if any)?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "delay" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" is 500 milliseconds. It is an optional parameter, meaning you don''t necessarily need to provide a value when using this option. This option accepts integer data types, representing the number of milliseconds before the next poll from Google Sheets. The "delay" option belongs to the "scheduler" group in the component configuration.'
    - question: 'Given that the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel component google-sheets allows the ScheduledPollConsumer to run immediately again if it polled one or more messages during its previous run, here''s a question that can be answered with the provided information:              What is the default behavior of the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel component google-sheets and what will happen if this option is set to true? (Assume the context is about the ScheduledPollConsumer.)'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "greedy" option in the Apache Camel component google-sheets is false, meaning that the ScheduledPollConsumer will not run immediately again if it polled one or more messages during its previous run. However, if you set this option to true, the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again if it polled 1 or more messages during its previous run.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and data type for the initialDelay option in the Apache Camel google-sheets component when using the scheduler group, and is it required?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel "google-sheets" component, when utilizing the "scheduler" group, is an integer of 1000 milliseconds. This option specifies the delay before the first poll starts. However, it''s important to note that providing this value is not required.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "repeatCount" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets", and can it be set to a positive integer value other than zero to limit the number of times this component will fire within the scheduler?'
      answer: |
       'The "repeatCount" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" serves to set a maximum limit on the number of times the component will execute within the scheduler. If you set it to a positive integer value other than zero, the scheduler will only fire that specific number of times. For instance, if you set it to 5, the component will execute five times, and if you leave it as its default value of 0, it means the component will continue firing indefinitely. If you wish to limit the execution of this component, you can set it to a positive integer.'
    - question: 'What is the default logging level for the consumer logs when using the Google Sheets component in Apache Camel, and how can I customize this logging level using the ''runLoggingLevel'' option?'
      answer: |
       'The default logging level for the consumer logs when using the Google Sheets component in Apache Camel is set to TRACE. If you wish to customize this logging level, you can do so by utilizing the ''runLoggingLevel'' option. This option allows you to configure the logging level for the log lines generated when the consumer polls.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom or shared thread pool using the scheduledExecutorService option in the Apache Camel google-sheets component, and is it optional to do so?'
      answer: |
       'In response to your question, you can configure a custom or shared thread pool for the consumer within the Apache Camel Google Sheets component by utilizing the "scheduledExecutorService" option. This feature allows you to specify a custom thread pool instead of the default single-threaded one per consumer. It''s important to note that using this option is not mandatory; if you don''t provide a value for it, each consumer will continue to use its own individual thread pool by default.'
    - question: 'What is the method to configure a cron scheduler using the Apache Camel Google Sheets component, and are there any predefined options like ''spring'' or ''quartz'' for built-in schedulers?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a cron scheduler with the Apache Camel Google Sheets component, you can utilize either the camel-spring or camel-quartz components, each providing a built-in scheduler. If you want to use a cron scheduler, simply set the value as ''spring'' or ''quartz'' in your configuration options.'
    - question: 'How can I properly set custom properties for a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz or Spring-based schedulers when using the Apache Camel Google Sheets component?'
      answer: |
       'To properly set custom properties for a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz or Spring-based schedulers when using the Apache Camel Google Sheets component, you can configure additional properties by specifying the "schedulerProperties" option in your route configuration. This object allows you to define any required properties specific to your scheduler. While it''s not mandatory to use these properties, they can be helpful for fine-tuning the behavior of the scheduler based on your needs.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and whether it''s mandatory to enable the scheduler auto-start feature when using the ''startScheduler'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-sheets''? (Hint: The default value is true, and the setting is optional.)'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior when using the ''startScheduler'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-sheets'' is that it will auto-start the scheduler. This setting is optional; you don''t have to enable it explicitly as its default value is already set to true.'
    - question: 'What is the default time unit for the `initialDelay` and `delay` options in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component when using it as a scheduler, and what options are available for this time unit?'
      answer: |
       'The default time unit for the `initialDelay` and `delay` options in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component, when used as a scheduler, is Milliseconds (MILLISECONDS). Other available time units for these options include SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS, and DAYS. However, setting these options to values other than MILLISECONDS requires the `timeUnit` option to be explicitly specified.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior of the "useFixedDelay" option in the Apache Camel''s Google Sheets component (`google-sheets`) regarding the scheduling strategy, and is it required for the operation of this component? (Hint: Consider the description provided in the given information.)'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior of the "useFixedDelay" option in Apache Camel''s Google Sheets component (`google-sheets`) is to use a fixed delay in scheduling strategy, as indicated by its initial value being true. This means that there will be a constant interval between each execution of the operation. However, it is important to note that using this option is not required for the operation of this component; it can be left unspecified or set to false if you wish to use a different scheduling strategy such as fixed rate (which could be more suitable depending on your specific use case). For further details about the concept of fixed delay and fixed rate, I would recommend referring to ScheduledExecutorService in JDK for comprehensive understanding.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "accessToken" option in the Apache Camel "google-sheets" component, why is it not required and what type of data does it accept? Also, can you explain when it is recommended to use refreshToken over accessToken for long term usage?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessToken" option within the Apache Camel "google-sheets" component serves as an OAuth 2 Access Token. While not required, its purpose is to authenticate your application with Google Sheets API. This token typically has an expiration time of around an hour, hence it''s advised to use the refreshToken for long term usage when dealing with continuous or extended operations. The "accessToken" accepts a string data type. For sustained functionality over longer periods, it is recommended to use the refreshToken, as it allows the client to obtain a new access token once the current one expires.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value for the "clientSecret" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets", and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientSecret" option within the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" serves as the secret key of your Google Sheets application for secure communication with Google APIs. It doesn''t have a default value, meaning you must provide it when configuring the component. Whether it is required or optional depends on the specific use case, but generally, it is considered important to ensure secure API access and should be provided if possible. The grouping of this option under "security" further emphasizes its role in maintaining the security of your application.'
    - question: 'How do I set the OAuth 2 refresh token when using the Google Sheets component in Apache Camel to ensure obtaining a new accessToken upon expiration of the current one, and is this configuration optional?'
      answer: |
       'To set the OAuth 2 refresh token when using the Google Sheets component in Apache Camel, you can configure the "refreshToken" option. This token is used to obtain a new accessToken once the current one expires, which is essential for long-lived applications. You can find this configuration under the "security" group. However, setting a refresh token is optional; it defaults to null, meaning no refresh token will be used if none is provided.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets", and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" is used to set a .json file with credentials for Service account. By default, it has no value (null). This option is optional, not required. It falls under the security group of settings for handling authentication and authorization when interacting with Google Sheets.'
