    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''applicationName'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-sheets'', and is it required to set a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The ''applicationName'' option in the Apache Camel component ''google-sheets'' serves to provide the name of the Google Sheets application. This name is expressed in camelCase notation, for example: camel-google-sheets/1.0. However, it''s important to note that the default value for this option is not set and its use is optional. You can choose to set a value for ''applicationName'', but if left unspecified, Camel will operate without explicitly defined application name for the Google Sheets component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, required status, and group of the "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets"?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" serves as the Client ID of the Google Sheets application you''re integrating with. It''s not required by default (can be left null), but it''s strongly recommended to provide one for authentication purposes. This option has a string data type and belongs to the common group of settings in this component, meaning it is one of several basic configuration properties.'
    - question: 'How can I configure the Google Sheets component in Apache Camel to make use of a shared configuration?'
      answer: |
       'To utilize a shared configuration for the Google Sheets component in Apache Camel, you should set the component''s option as "configuration" with an object that contains your shared settings. Here is an example route snippet:              ```java       from("google-sheets:someUri")           .configuration(new SharedGoogleSheetsConfig()); // replace SharedGoogleSheetsConfig with your own configuration object       ```              The `SharedGoogleSheetsConfig` class should contain the required properties, such as credentials or connection details, which will be used across different routes making use of the Google Sheets component. Keep in mind that using a shared configuration is optional and can be disabled by omitting this setting altogether if needed.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component ''google-sheets'', specifically when it pertains to a wide-domain service account? Furthermore, is this option required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "delegate" option in the Apache Camel component ''google-sheets'' for a wide-domain service account has a default value of null. This option allows you to delegate access to the Google Sheets API by using a service account that has the necessary permissions for wide-domain usage. However, whether to use this delegation is optional, as specified in your component configuration; if not provided, it defaults to using the credentials associated with the service account directly.'
    - question: 'What are the possible values and their descriptions of the "scopes" option in the Apache Camel component Google Sheets, and is it mandatory to specify a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component Google Sheets, the "scopes" option specifies the level of permissions you want an application to have to a user account. It''s a comma-separated string allowing multiple scopes. For example, if you want your application to read data from Google Sheets, you might set it to ''https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly''. To find more detailed information about available scopes, you can refer to the official Google developer documentation: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes. The "scopes" option is not mandatory; you may choose to leave it as null if you don''t need specific permissions beyond the default scope.'
    - question: 'In Apache Camel''s google-sheets component, when using the bridgeErrorHandler option, under what circumstances would exceptions encountered by the consumer while trying to pick up incoming messages be handled differently compared to the default behavior of the consumer?'
      answer: |
       'When using the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in Apache Camel''s google-sheets component, exceptions encountered by the consumer while trying to pick up incoming messages will be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler rather than being logged and ignored as in the default behavior. This is only applicable if the third-party component allows Camel to be alerted when an exception was thrown. If the 3rd party component handles exceptions internally, the bridgeErrorHandler will not be possible. Improvements to the Camel component may allow for hooking into the 3rd party component in future releases to enable this functionality.'
    - question: 'How does setting the Apache Camel option "splitResult" in the google-sheets component behave, and what happens if I set it to false instead of its default value (true)?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s Google Sheets component, when the "splitResult" option is set to true (its default value), each element in an array or collection will trigger a separate exchange, causing their respective routes to be executed individually for each exchange. If you were to set it to false instead, a single exchange would be used for the entire list or array, bypassing the individual processing of each element. This behavior can affect the way data is processed in your integration based on the specific requirements of your use case.'
    - question: 'Here''s a question based on the information provided:              "What does the ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component do, and when might it be beneficial to set this option to true?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component allows you to start the producer on-demand (i.e., lazily) instead of during the initial startup of your routes or CamelContext. This can be beneficial when the producer may fail during initial startup, which could prevent the route from being properly started. By deferring the startup failure to be handled later via Camel''s routing error handlers, you avoid causing the whole route to fail. However, it is important to note that using this option means the first message processed will take a little extra time since creating and starting the producer are performed then, which could prolong overall processing times.'
    - question: 'How does the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component function, and is its default value set to true, meaning autowiring is enabled by default? Additionally, could you explain when this feature might be particularly useful or required in a Camel route setup?'
      answer: |
       'The "autowiredEnabled" option within the Apache Camel Google Sheets component serves the purpose of enabling automatic autowiring for relevant options, which facilitates the process by looking up in the registry to discover if there is a unique instance of matching type. This configuration is applied to the component, allowing for easy setup of components such as JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, and more. It simplifies the configuration of these complex components in a Camel route, particularly beneficial when working with advanced features or large-scale applications. By default, this option is set to true, meaning that autowiring is enabled by default in the Google Sheets component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the `clientFactory` option in the Apache Camel''s Google Sheets component (`google-sheets`), and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The `clientFactory` option in the Apache Camel''s Google Sheets component, specifically the `google-sheets`, serves as an optional configuration for creating the client. By default, it utilizes the `BatchGoogleSheetsClientFactory`. However, you can choose to provide a different client factory implementation if needed. It''s not mandatory to provide a value for this option as the default setting will be applied in its absence, making it useful for those who require advanced customization.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "accessToken" option within the Apache Camel "google-sheets" component, and is it recommended to use this option for long-term usage due to its expiration time? Additionally, can you explain where the "refreshToken" might be more suitable in the context of this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "accessToken" option within the Apache Camel "google-sheets" component is an OAuth 2 access token, intended to authenticate your application with Google Sheets API. However, it''s worth noting that this token typically expires after an hour, making it less suitable for long-term usage. Instead, it is recommended to use the "refreshToken" option in conjunction with the "accessToken." The refresh token is used to obtain a new access token once the current one expires. This ensures continuous access to Google Sheets API services even when the access token has timed out. The "group" of this option falls under security, as it pertains to authentication and authorization within the API context.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose, default value, data type, required status, and group affiliation of the `clientSecret` option within the Apache Camel component named "google-sheets"?'
      answer: |
       'The `clientSecret` option within the Apache Camel component called "google-sheets" is a string variable associated with the group "security". Its purpose is to store the client secret of the Google Sheets application, but it has no default value. Whether this option is required or not is optional, meaning its usage is not necessary for all instances of this component.'
    - question: 'How is it possible to configure the Apache Camel''s Google Sheets component (google-sheets) to use an OAuth 2 refresh token for obtaining a new access token when the current one expires, and whether this configuration step is mandatory or optional?'
      answer: |
       'To configure Apache Camel''s Google Sheets component (google-sheets) to use an OAuth 2 refresh token for obtaining a new access token when the current one expires, you can set the "refreshToken" option. This option allows the component to retrieve a fresh access token as needed in long-lived applications. However, using this configuration step is optional and not mandatory. The "refreshToken" option is of type string, and its default value is null. This configuration falls under the security group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "serviceAccountKey" option within the Apache Camel component "google-sheets", and is it required to provide a default value or can it be left empty?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceAccountKey" option within the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" is designed to allow you to set a .json file containing Service account credentials for accessing Google Sheets. It''s not mandatory to provide a default value; you can leave it empty if you wish, but remember that without providing credentials, Google Sheets access will not be granted.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the ''applicationName'' option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component? Additionally, is it required and what are some possible values for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The ''applicationName'' option within the Apache Camel Google Sheets component serves to specify the name of the Google Sheets application, should one be provided explicitly. For instance, a possible value might resemble camel-google-sheets/1.0. However, this option is not required and can be omitted during its usage. Some other potential values could include custom names or versions for specific instances of the component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "clientId" option within the Apache Camel''s google-sheets component and does it have a default value, type, and is its usage mandatory or optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "clientId" option in Apache Camel''s google-sheets component serves the purpose of specifying the Client ID of the Google Sheets application. It does not have a default value, meaning you must provide one when configuring your Google Sheets integration. Its type is string, and while its usage is not mandatory, it can be included in your configuration if you wish to authenticate your application using an existing Client ID. This group falls under "common" settings within the component configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "delegate" option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component, and is it required when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "delegate" option within the Apache Camel Google Sheets component serves the purpose of delegating access for a wide-domain service account. This option is not mandatory, meaning it can be omitted during use. By default, the value assigned to this option is null.'
    - question: 'How can I use the "inBody" option within the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" to pass a parameter as the value in the message body, and is it optional to use this option?'
      answer: |
       'In response to your query, you can utilize the "inBody" option within the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" by setting it to the name of the parameter you wish to pass as the value in the message body. This option is optional; you can choose whether or not to use it depending on the specific requirements of your use case. If you opt to use "inBody", simply assign a string value to it during your route configuration to have this parameter passed in the exchange''s body when making requests with Google Sheets.'
    - question: 'What scopes should I set in the "scopes" option of the Apache Camel component Google-Sheets, to grant specific levels of permissions to a user account in my application, and how can I find more information about available scopes for this integration?'
      answer: |
       'To grant specific levels of permissions to a user account in your Google Sheets application using the Apache Camel component, you should set the "scopes" option with one or more permissions (scopes) relevant to your use case, separated by commas. You can find detailed information about available scopes for this integration at https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes. Some common scopes for Google Sheets include "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets" to access spreadsheet files, or "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive" to work with Google Drive. If you don''t specify the scopes option in your application, it will not have any permissions by default.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel Google-Sheets component and how do I set it to send an empty message when the consumer did not poll any files?'
      answer: |
       'The "sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle" option in the Apache Camel Google-Sheets component is intended to control the behavior of the polling consumer when no files are polled. By default, it''s set to false. If you wish to have an empty message (no body) sent under such conditions, you can enable this option by setting its value to true. This configuration can be found within the "consumer" group of settings for your Google-Sheets component in Apache Camel.'
    - question: 'How do I configure the "splitResult" option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component so that it uses a single exchange for an entire array, rather than generating an exchange for each individual element? Does this configuration require modifying the default value of this option?'
      answer: |
       'To use a single exchange for an entire array in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component instead of generating an exchange for each individual element, you can set the "splitResult" option to false. The default value of this option is true, so modifying it is optional if you wish to keep the default behavior. So, to configure the component as desired, you would adjust its settings like this: {"component":"google-sheets","option":"splitResult","value":false}'
    - question: 'How does the "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" work, and when is it not possible to use this feature? Can you provide an explanation for its default value, uses, and when it can be considered as a required option?'
      answer: |
       'The "bridgeErrorHandler" option in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" permits linking the consumer to Camel''s routing Error Handler, meaning that any exceptions (if applicable) that arise while the Camel consumer is trying to retrieve incoming messages will now be managed as messages and processed by the routing Error Handler. However, it''s essential to note that this feature is only viable if the third-party component enables Camel to receive alerts upon an exception being thrown. Some components manage exceptions internally exclusively, which disallows bridgeErrorHandler usage in such cases. In other instances, we may enhance the Camel component to interface with the third-party component, thereby making this possible in future releases. By default, the consumer will apply the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to handle exceptions, which will log them at WARN or ERROR level and then disregard them. The "bridgeErrorHandler" is not a required option by default; it falls under the "consumer (advanced)" group and can be considered optional.'
    - question: 'Given the information you provided about the Apache Camel component google-sheets, here''s a question that could be asked:              "What is the purpose of the `exceptionHandler` option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component and what happens when it''s not set or not required?"'
      answer: |
       'The `exceptionHandler` option in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component allows the user to define a custom ExceptionHandler. When this option is not set or required, by default the component will handle exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. However, if the "bridgeErrorHandler" option is enabled, the `exceptionHandler` option becomes inactive.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "exchangePattern" option within the Apache Camel Google Sheets component, and can it be configured when using a consumer in a Camel route?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the "exchangePattern" option within the Apache Camel Google Sheets component is null, meaning no specific exchange pattern is set when a consumer creates an exchange. This option determines the exchange pattern for interactions between producers and consumers in Camel routes. While it''s not required, when configured, it can be found under the "consumer (advanced)" group in Camel settings.'
    - question: 'How can I configure a custom polling strategy for error handling in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component when using it in Camel, and is there a default value for this configuration?'
      answer: |
       'To configure a custom polling strategy for error handling in the Apache Camel Google Sheets component, you can utilize the "pollStrategy" option under the "component" of "google-sheets". This allows you to provide your own implementation of `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy`, thereby controlling the error handling that typically occurs during a poll operation before an Exchange has been created and routed in Camel. However, there is no default value for this configuration. The use of this option is within the "consumer (advanced)" group, so it may require more advanced knowledge and usage of Apache Camel.'
    - question: '"How can you configure Apache Camel''s google-sheets component to start the producer lazily, allowing the CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting? Additionally, explain the impact on processing time when the first message is processed."'
      answer: |
       'To configure Apache Camel''s google-sheets component to start the producer lazily, you can set the "lazyStartProducer" option to true. This allows the CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting, without causing the route failure. By deferring the startup of the producer to be lazy, any startup failures can be handled during routing messages via Camel''s error handlers.              However, do note that when the first message is processed, creating and starting the producer may take a little additional time, thereby prolonging the total processing time of the process. This delay should be considered when optimizing your applications for performance. The default value for this option is false, but it can be set to true if you require lazy startup behavior for your google-sheets component. This feature falls under the "producer (advanced)" group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Sheets, if it is not set by default and which groups is this option associated with?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffErrorThreshold" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Sheets does not have a default value. Its purpose is to define the number of subsequent error polls (failed due to some error) that should occur before the "backoffMultiplier" should kick-in, allowing the retries to slow down over time when encountering persistent errors. This option falls under the scheduler group as it primarily deals with managing retry schedules and backoffs in Camel routes using Google Sheets.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and purpose of the "backoffIdleThreshold" option within the Apache Camel Google Sheets component''s scheduler group, when not provided?'
      answer: |
       'The "backoffIdleThreshold" option within the Apache Camel Google Sheets component''s scheduler group does not have a default value. Its purpose is to denote the number of subsequent idle polls that should occur before the "backoffMultiplier" should become active, triggering a backoff strategy when a task is unable to execute due to certain conditions such as network congestion or server unavailability. When this option is not provided, there will be no specific delay between idle poll attempts before the backoff strategy kicks in.'
    - question: 'How can I set the number of polling attempts to skip when there have been consecutive idle or error events in Apache Camel''s Google Sheets component, given that backoffMultiplier is an optional integer configuration that works with the scheduled polling consumer? And could you explain the relationship between this setting and the backoffIdleThreshold and backoffErrorThreshold options?'
      answer: |
       'To set the number of polling attempts to skip when there have been consecutive idle or error events in Apache Camel''s Google Sheets component, you can use the "backoffMultiplier" configuration option. This optional integer value specifies the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt occurs again, after a series of idle/error events.              Note that when using backoffMultiplier, it is essential to configure the options backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold as well. These threshold values determine under what conditions the consumer considers an event as idle or error respectively. When one of these thresholds is met for a certain number of times consecutively, the backoffMultiplier takes effect by skipping subsequent polling attempts.              In summary, using the backoffMultiplier allows your Google Sheets component to dynamically adjust its polling rate when faced with idle or error events, ensuring better reliability and efficiency in scheduled data exchange.'
    - question: 'How can I set a custom delay (in milliseconds) between Google Sheets'' polling using Apache Camel component for Google Sheets?'
      answer: |
       'To set a custom delay (in milliseconds) between Google Sheets'' polling when using the Apache Camel component for Google Sheets, you can configure the "delay" option in your route''s Google Sheets component settings. By default, the delay is set to 500 milliseconds, but you can change it as needed by specifying an integer value that represents the desired delay. This option is found within the "scheduler" group of the component configuration, making it optional (not required) if you prefer the default setting.'
    - question: 'Here''s a possible question that could be answered using the provided information:              "What happens when the ''greedy'' option is enabled for the ''google-sheets'' component in Apache Camel, and how does this differ from its default setting?"'
      answer: |
       'When you enable the ''greedy'' option for the ''google-sheets'' component within Apache Camel, it alters the behavior of the ScheduledPollConsumer significantly. With greedy set to true, if the previous run polls one or more messages, the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, thus consuming all pending messages at once. However, in its default state (greedy set to false), the ScheduledPollConsumer waits for the scheduled interval before it runs again, regardless of whether there are new messages to be consumed or not.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Sheets, and is it a required setting? (Milliseconds before the first poll starts; default value: 1000, type: integer, required: false)'
      answer: |
       'The "initialDelay" option in the Apache Camel component for Google Sheets is intended to set the delay, in milliseconds, before the first polling event commences. By default, this value stands at 1000 milliseconds (or one second). It is worth noting that this setting is optional; if it''s not provided during configuration, Camel will proceed with the polling process without the initial delay. This parameter falls under the "scheduler" group of settings in the component''s configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and maximum limit of number of times the "google-sheets" component in Apache Camel will execute if the "repeatCount" option is not specified, and how does specifying a value other than zero or negative change this behavior?'
      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s "google-sheets" component, if the "repeatCount" option is not specified, the default behavior is that the component will execute the task indefinitely, i.e., it will fire forever. However, by specifying a positive integer value for the "repeatCount" option, you can limit the number of times this component will execute. For instance, if you set it to 5, it will only execute five times. Conversely, a value of zero or negative keeps the component firing indefinitely as per the default behavior.'
    - question: 'What is the default logging level for the "runLoggingLevel" option of the Apache Camel component named "google-sheets"? If this setting is modified, what possible log levels can be chosen, and is it mandatory to set a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The default logging level for the "runLoggingLevel" option of the "google-sheets" component in Apache Camel is TRACE. If you choose to modify this setting, possible log levels that can be chosen include DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, and OFF, each progressively showing fewer details as the log level increases from DEBUG to OFF. However, it''s not mandatory to set a value for this option as it has a default value (TRACE).'
    - question: 'How can I configure the thread pool used by an Apache Camel route with the Google Sheets component in a multi-threaded manner using the scheduledExecutorService option? Does the default value for this configuration option have a preset number of threads or can I provide my own custom thread pool?'
      answer: |
       'To configure the thread pool used by an Apache Camel route with the Google Sheets component in a multi-threaded manner, you can utilize the scheduledExecutorService option. This feature allows for configuring a custom or shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default, each consumer operates within its own single-threaded thread pool. However, setting up a custom thread pool via scheduledExecutorService provides the flexibility of managing multiple threads according to your requirements. The default value for this configuration option does not have a preset number of threads; you can provide your own custom thread pool by defining the appropriate settings for this option when configuring the component.'
    - question: 'What is the recommended method to set up a scheduled operation using the Apache Camel Google Sheets component, and how do you specify a cron expression when utilizing either the camel-spring or camel-quartz scheduler component?'
      answer: |
       'To set up a scheduled operation using the Apache Camel Google Sheets component, you can leverage either the camel-spring or camel-quartz scheduler. Both offer built-in schedulers that allow you to utilize cron expressions. In case of camel-spring, specify "spring" as the option for your scheduler, and for camel-quartz, use "quartz". To configure a cron expression when using either component, simply include your desired cron pattern in the appropriate field (e.g., Quartz''s `cronExpression`). Make sure to consult the documentation for specific instructions on implementing your chosen scheduler and integrating it with the Google Sheets component.'
    - question: 'What are the available properties for configuration within the "google-sheets" component''s "schedulerProperties" option in Apache Camel when using a custom scheduler or any Quartz or Spring-based schedulers, and is it required to provide any specific values for these properties by default?'
      answer: |
       'In response to your query, the "google-sheets" component''s "schedulerProperties" option in Apache Camel offers additional configurations when using a custom scheduler or Quartz, Spring-based schedulers. These properties can be found within an object structure. It is not mandatory to provide specific values for these properties by default, as they are optional. Grouped under the "scheduler" category, they allow for fine-tuning and customization of scheduling behaviors according to your specific use case.'
    - question: 'How do I configure the Apache Camel google-sheets component to disable auto-start for its built-in scheduler, if it is not required? Since by default it starts automatically, can you explain how I could manually control its startup via setting in this component''s ''startScheduler'' option?'
      answer: |
       'To disable the auto-start of the built-in scheduler for the Apache Camel Google Sheets component, you should set the ''startScheduler'' option to false when initializing your route. Here''s an example:              ```java       from("google-sheets://...")           .scheduler(new PropertiesComponent()).disableStartupScheduler(); // Set startScheduler to false here           ...;       ```              In this code snippet, the `PropertiesComponent` is used to configure options for the Google Sheets component, and the `disableStartupScheduler()` method call sets the ''startScheduler'' option to false, thereby manually controlling its startup.'
    - question: 'What is the default time unit used in the `initialDelay` and `delay` options when using the `google-sheets` component''s `timeUnit` option with Apache Camel, and what are the other available time units that can be specified for this option if not required?'
      answer: |
       'The default time unit used in the `initialDelay` and `delay` options when utilizing the `timeUnit` option within the `google-sheets` component of Apache Camel is MILLISECONDS. However, other available time units that can be specified for this option if not required include: SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS, and DAYS.'
    - question: 'Given the information provided, a question that could be asked about the `useFixedDelay` option in the Apache Camel component `google-sheets` is: "What is the default value of the `useFixedDelay` option for the Google Sheets component and how does it affect the scheduling of operations?" The answer to this question would be that the default value of the `useFixedDelay` option is `true`, which means that fixed delays will be used when scheduling operations. For further information about fixed delay vs fixed rate, you can refer to the ScheduledExecutorService documentation in Java JDK.'
      answer: |
       'The default value of the `useFixedDelay` option for the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" is `true`, indicating that a fixed delay will be employed when scheduling operations. This choice is based on the ScheduledExecutorService in JDK, where you can find further details on the distinctions between using fixed delays versus fixed rates.'
    - question: 'How should I handle the OAuth 2 access token in the Apache Camel component google-sheets, given that it usually expires after an hour and refreshToken is recommended for long term usage? Also, could you please explain what the ''defaultValue'' refers to in this context?'
      answer: |
       'To handle the OAuth 2 access token in the Apache Camel component "google-sheets", it''s advisable to use a refresh token for long-term usage as the access token usually expires after an hour. The ''defaultValue'' in this context refers to a fallback value that will be used if no other value is provided. In your case, since there is no default value specified, you would not use one with the Google Sheets component. Instead, you should implement a mechanism for refreshing the access token when it expires or based on your specific needs.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `clientSecret` option in the Apache Camel `google-sheets` component, and is it required or optional? Also, does it have a default value, and what type of data should be provided for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The `clientSecret` option within the Apache Camel `google-sheets` component serves as the secret key for authentication of your Google Sheets application.

    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "refreshToken" option within the Apache Camel''s Google Sheets component and why might it not be set by default? (Answer: The refreshToken option is used to obtain a new access token whenever the current one expires.

      answer: |
       'In the context of Apache Camel''s Google Sheets component, the "refreshToken" option serves the purpose of obtaining a new access token when the current one expires. This is crucial for long-lived applications as they typically run for extended periods, making it necessary to refresh tokens periodically due to security and authorization reasons. However, this option might not be set by default because it involves handling OAuth 2 security credentials, which necessitates careful management and attention to ensure secure operation.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "serviceAccountKey" option in the Apache Camel component called "google-sheets", and what type of value should it contain to be correctly utilized, according to its description and default value specified?'
      answer: |
       'The "serviceAccountKey" option within the Apache Camel component "google-sheets" is used to provide a .json file with credentials for your Google Service Account. According to its specification, the appropriate value that should be assigned to this option in order to function correctly is a string containing the path to your JSON credentials file. However, it is important to note that while this option may not be required for all uses of the "google-sheets" component, it does fall under the "security" category due to its role in granting secure access to Google Sheets data through Service Accounts.'
