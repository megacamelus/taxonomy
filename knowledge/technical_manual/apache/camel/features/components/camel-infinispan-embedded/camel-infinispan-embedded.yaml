    - question: 'What is the default configuration and whether it is required for using the "infinispan-embedded" component in Apache Camel when setting up a message exchange with Infinispan cache?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for the configuration of the "infinispan-embedded" component in Apache Camel is null, meaning no default configuration is provided. However, using this component doesn''t necessarily require providing a configuration as it falls under the "common" group, which typically includes options with reasonable defaults if not specified. If you wish to customize the behavior of Infinispan cache when used within Camel, you can provide an appropriate configuration object according to your needs.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "queryBuilder" option in the Apache Camel Infinispan-Embedded component, and is it optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "queryBuilder" option in the Apache Camel Infinispan-Embedded component specifies a query builder, which allows you to define complex queries for fetching data from Infinispan cache. Its default value is `null`. It''s an optional parameter as indicated by "required: false", meaning it can be omitted when not needed in your use case.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel infinispan-embedded component affect message handling of incoming messages and how does it differ from the default exception handling provided by Camel?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel infinispan-embedded component allows for exceptional scenarios to be treated as messages, handled by the routing Error Handler instead of being logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored, which is the default behavior. This means that any exceptions that occur while the Camel consumer is trying to pick up incoming messages will now be processed as a message and dealt with accordingly by the Error Handler. However, not all 3rd party components support this functionality; it depends on whether the component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. In cases where the bridgeErrorHandler is not possible, the consumer will continue using the default exception handler provided by Camel.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the `clusteredListener` option in an Apache Camel component with Infinispan-embedded influence the behavior of a listener when using it within a clustered environment? Is it necessary to activate this option for the listener to be installed and operated across the entire cluster, and if so, what are the implications of setting it to true?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the `clusteredListener` option in an Apache Camel component with Infinispan-embedded influences the behavior of a listener significantly when used within a clustered environment. If set to true, the specified listener will be installed and managed across the entire cluster, ensuring consistency and coordination among all cluster nodes. This means that changes made by the listener on one node will be visible and applied consistently on other cluster nodes. However, it is not strictly necessary to activate this option for the listener to function; if left at its default value of false, the listener will still operate but independently within each node, without any cross-cluster synchronization. Setting `clusteredListener` to true has implications such as increased resource usage due to the need for cluster-wide communication and coordination. Therefore, consider enabling this option only when requiring cluster-aware functionality for your listener.'
    - question: 'How do I obtain the custom listener set in an Apache Camel route that is using the Infinispan-Embedded component if one has been provided? If no custom listener has been specified, what would be its default value in this context?'
      answer: |
       'To obtain the custom listener set in an Apache Camel route utilizing the Infinispan-Embedded component, you can access it directly using the component''s configuration. If a custom listener has been provided during the configuration of the Infinispan-Embedded component, its value will be returned.              However, if no custom listener has been specified explicitly in this context, its default value within the Apache Camel and Infinispan configurations is `null`.'
    - question: 'What are the event types that can be specified for the "eventTypes" option of the Apache Camel "infinispan-embedded" component, and what is the default value and type of this option?'
      answer: |
       'The event types that can be specified for the "eventTypes" option of the Apache Camel "infinispan-embedded" component include: CACHE_ENTRY_ACTIVATED, CACHE_ENTRY_PASSIVATED, CACHE_ENTRY_VISITED, CACHE_ENTRY_LOADED, CACHE_ENTRY_EVICTED, CACHE_ENTRY_CREATED, CACHE_ENTRY_REMOVED, CACHE_ENTRY_MODIFIED, TRANSACTION_COMPLETED, TRANSACTION_REGISTERED, CACHE_ENTRY_INVALIDATED, CACHE_ENTRY_EXPIRED, DATA_REHASHED, TOPOLOGY_CHANGED, PARTITION_STATUS_CHANGED, PERSISTENCE_AVAILABILITY_CHANGED. The default value for this option is null and its data type is a string. It is an optional setting under the "consumer" group of configuration options.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and if it can be configurable when using asynchronous notifications in an Infinispan-Embedded component within the Apache Camel context for a consumer?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior when using notifications in an Infinispan-Embedded component within the Apache Camel context for a consumer is that the notifications will be received synchronously (i.e., true). However, this behavior can be configured if needed. To change it to asynchronous notifications, you would set the "sync" option to false in your configuration.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and optional nature (indicated by its "required": false property) of the "defaultValue" option in the Apache Camel component "infinispan-embedded", as well as how to set a specific default value for some producer operations if it is chosen to be configured?'
      answer: |
       'In the Apache Camel component, "infinispan-embedded," the "defaultValue" option provides a way to set a specific value for some producer operations, which can be useful in certain use cases where you want to define a default behavior when no explicit value is provided. Since the "required" property is false, it implies that configuring this option is optional; you may choose not to set it if the default behavior suits your needs. If you wish to explicitly set the default value, you can do so by specifying a value for the "defaultValue" key when configuring your "infinispan-embedded" component in your Camel route.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "key" option in the Apache Camel Infinispan-embedded component, and can it be used without setting a value (as indicated by its default value being null)? Also, under what category does this option fall in terms of usage (producers or consumers)?'
      answer: |
       'The "key" option in the Apache Camel Infinispan-embedded component is used to set a specific key for producer operations. This means that when using this option, you can specify a unique identifier for each item being stored in the Infinispan cache. It''s worth noting that this option is optional and can be omitted if a default value of null is acceptable, allowing you to use the component without explicitly setting a key. The "key" option falls under the category of producers as it''s typically used to determine how data is sent or stored into the cache (rather than retrieving data from the cache).'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component ''infinispan-embedded'', and when would it be beneficial to set this option to true? Also, could you explain what impact setting this option to true might have on the overall processing time for messages being processed through this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "lazyStartProducer" option in the Apache Camel component ''infinispan-embedded'' is designed to allow you to defer the startup of a producer, especially when its initial start could potentially fail during CamelContext or route initialization, leading to failure of the entire setup. By setting this option to true and allowing lazy start, such failures can be managed through Camel''s routing error handlers upon processing the first message.              It''s important to note that since the producer is only started when the first message arrives, creating and starting it could take some additional time during message processing, hence potentially prolonging overall processing times for messages being processed through this component. This is because initializing a new producer requires resources and setup time. However, this delay may be considered acceptable to ensure that your routes and CamelContext can start successfully even if they rely on an initially problematic producer.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "oldValue" option in the Apache Camel Infinispan-Embedded component, when it is used within producer operations, and is its use optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "oldValue" option in the Apache Camel Infinispan-Embedded component is designed for some producer operations. This option allows you to set a specific old value when using certain functions. However, it''s essential to note that if no value is provided explicitly, it defaults to null. Additionally, using "oldValue" within producer operations is optional; its inclusion is not required in every usage scenario.'
    - question: 'What is the default operation for an Infinispan-Embedded Camel component when producing data if the operation is not specified?'
      answer: |
       'The default operation for an Infinispan-Embedded Camel component, when producing data, is a PUT operation if no specific operation is specified.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "value" option in the Apache Camel Infinispan-Embedded component, under what conditions is it considered optional, and which group does it belong to?'
      answer: |
       'The "value" option in the Apache Camel Infinisпан-Embedded component is set for producer operations, serving as a place to define a specific value. By default, it doesn''t have a value (defaultValue: null). This option is considered optional under some conditions as it may not always be necessary to provide an explicit value when performing producer operations within the "producer" group.'
    - question: 'How does enabling or disabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel "infinispan-embedded" component affect its behavior when configuring options like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc., and what is the default value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the "autowiredEnabled" option in the Apache Camel "infinispan-embedded" component allows for automatic configuration of options like JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, and so forth. This is achieved by looking up in the registry to find a single instance of matching type, which is then configured on the component. If you don''t enable this option, you''ll need to manually configure these options yourself. It''s important to note that setting "autowiredEnabled" to true or false does not affect the functionality of the Infinispan-embedded cache itself; it only changes how you configure related components like those mentioned above. By default, this option is set to true, meaning autowiring is enabled, for ease of use and convenience during configuration.'
    - question: '"What is the purpose and default value of the ''cacheContainer'' option when using the Apache Camel Infinispan-Embedded component, and is its usage considered advanced or essential?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''cacheContainer'' option, when using the Apache Camel Infinispan-Embedded component, is an advanced configuration setting that specifies the cache container to connect. By default, it does not have a value assigned (defaultValue: null). Its usage is considered advanced as it allows you to manually manage and configure the connection to the Infinispan cache container. This can be useful for complex use cases where fine-tuning the cache behavior is required, but it may not be essential for basic applications using Camel with Infinispan.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "cacheContainerConfiguration" option in the Apache Camel''s "infinispan-embedded" component, and are there any specific requirements or groups it belongs to?'
      answer: |
       'The "cacheContainerConfiguration" option in Apache Camel''s "infinispan-embedded" component is an object type that serves as a default configuration for the cache container. This means it will be used if a cacheContainer is not explicitly defined within your configuration. Its default value is null, meaning no default configuration is set by default. This option falls under the "advanced" group, indicating it may be more suitable for experienced users or specific use cases where explicit control over cache container settings is required.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the configurationUri option in the Apache Camel component named infinispan-embedded, and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option? If not, what are its possible values when using it if provided?'
      answer: |
       'The `configurationUri` option in the "infinispan-embedded" Apache Camel component is an implementation-specific URI for initializing the CacheManager. This URI specifies how the Infinispan CacheManager should be configured, such as location of the cache store, serialization type, or cache mode. It''s not mandatory to provide a value for this option as its use is considered advanced. When provided, the `configurationUri` can take any valid string that follows URI syntax representing an Infinispan configuration file or XML document, or URL pointing to one of these resources.'
    - question: 'What are the default flag options for an Apache Camel Infinispan-embedded component when using it in a cache invocation, and is specifying these flags optional?'
      answer: |
       'The default flag options for an Apache Camel Infinispan-embedded component when using it in a cache invocation are not specified by default. Specifying these flags is optional as indicated by the "required: false" in the configuration. The flags are provided as a comma-separated list of `org.infinispan.context.Flag` objects, which can be applied by default on each cache invocation if explicitly set. These options fall under the "advanced" group of settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the `remappingFunction` option within the Apache Camel component called `infinispan-embedded`, and what kind of value can be set for this option, if it is not required? Is there a default value assigned to this option?'
      answer: |
       'The `remappingFunction` option in the Apache Camel component `infinispan-embedded` allows you to specify a custom function to remap keys or values within compute operations, if such a functionality is desired. This option accepts an object as its value, but it should be noted that providing a remappingFunction is optional; it does not have a default value assigned and is classified under the advanced group of configuration options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "resultHeader" option in the Apache Camel infinispan-embedded component, and how can it be utilized to preserve the original message body while storing the operation result as a header instead of the message body? Also, can you explain when this option may be useful and what value should be provided if it is chosen to use it?'
      answer: |
       'The "resultHeader" option in the Apache Camel Infinispan-Embedded component serves the purpose of storing the operation result as a header rather than the message body. By default, the query result resides within the message body, overwriting any existing content. However, setting "resultHeader" allows you to specify a name for the header where the query result will be stored, thereby preserving the original message body intact. You can utilize this option when you want to maintain the contents of the message body alongside the operation result. The value provided for "resultHeader" is a string representing the name of the header; it may be overridden by an in-message header named CamelInfinispanOperationResultHeader. This option is useful in scenarios where the original data within the message body is critical and should not be discarded when performing Infinispan operations.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of using the ''queryBuilder'' option within the Apache Camel''s "infinispan-embedded" component, and is there a default value for this configuration if it is not provided when using this component?'
      answer: |
       'The ''queryBuilder'' option in the Apache Camel''s "infinispan-embedded" component serves to specify the query builder for your Infinispan cache operations. It allows you to build complex queries for retrieving data from your cache. However, it is an optional configuration as indicated by its "required: false". There is no default value provided for this configuration if not explicitly set, so it''s essential to define one that suits your use case when working with the "infinispan-embedded" component.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "clusteredListener" option in the Apache Camel "infinispan-embedded" component, and can it be considered as a mandatory configuration option?'
      answer: |
       'The "clusteredListener" option in the Apache Camel "infinispan-embedded" component is designed to indicate whether a listener will be installed for the entire clustered Infinispan instance. By default, this option is set to false, meaning a listener is not installed unless explicitly configured. It can be considered as an optional configuration, as its use depends on your specific requirements and application setup within the Infinispan consumer group.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "customListener" option when using the Apache Camel Infinispan-Embedded component, and what is its default value and whether it''s mandatory to provide one?'
      answer: |
       'The "customListener" option for Apache Camel''s Infinispan-Embedded component allows you to provide a custom listener function when working with Infinispan. If a custom listener is provided, this option will return that specific listener in use. However, if no custom listener is provided, the default value is null. The provision of a custom listener is optional, and it falls under the consumer group of options.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the "eventTypes" option in the Apache Camel component named "infinispan-embedded", and what are the available event types that can be specified to register for specific cache events?'
      answer: |
       'The "eventTypes" option within the Apache Camel component called "infinispan-embedded" is designed to allow you to specify a set of events that the consumer will register interest in. This can include multiple event types, separated by commas. Available event types for registration are: CACHE_ENTRY_ACTIVATED, CACHE_ENTRY_PASSIVATED, CACHE_ENTRY_VISITED, CACHE_ENTRY_LOADED, CACHE_ENTRY_EVICTED, CACHE_ENTRY_CREATED, CACHE_ENTRY_REMOVED, CACHE_ENTRY_MODIFIED, TRANSACTION_COMPLETED, TRANSACTION_REGISTERED, CACHE_ENTRY_INVALIDATED, CACHE_ENTRY_EXPIRED, DATA_REHASHED, TOPOLOGY_CHANGED, PARTITION_STATUS_CHANGED, PERSISTENCE_AVAILABILITY_CHANGED. The use of this option is optional and falls under the "consumer" grouping.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and optionality of the "sync" parameter in the Apache Camel''s Infinispan-Embedded component regarding consumer notification synchronization? Is it true by default and can it be configured otherwise?'
      answer: |
       'The default behavior for the sync parameter in the Apache Camel''s Infinispan-Embedded component is that it is set to true, meaning notifications are received synchronously. If you wish to configure this option differently, it can be done since the sync parameter is configurable (i.e., it can be false if desired). This setting pertains only to the consumer group.'
    - question: 'How does enabling the bridgeErrorHandler option in the Apache Camel Infinispan-embedded component differ from the default Exception Handler behavior, and when is it beneficial to use the former instead of the latter?'
      answer: |
       'Enabling the `bridgeErrorHandler` option in the Apache Camel Infinispan-embedded component alters its behavior from the default Exception Handler by routing any exceptions that may occur while the consumer is attempting to pick up incoming messages through the Camel routing Error Handler, instead of logging at WARN or ERROR level and ignoring them. This approach allows for a more customizable and robust handling of exceptions.              However, it''s important to note that not all third-party components support this functionality; some handle exceptions internally without allowing Camel to be informed. In such cases, the `bridgeErrorHandler` option may not be possible. In other situations, future releases may incorporate improvements to the Camel component that enable bridging with 3rd party components to make this feature available.              Using the `bridgeErrorHandler` instead of the default Exception Handler can be beneficial when a more elaborate and flexible exception-handling strategy is necessary for handling specific business needs or errors encountered during message processing in your application.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the exceptionHandler option in the Apache Camel component Infinispan-Embedded, and when would it not be used if the bridgeErrorHandler is enabled? Also, could you explain what happens by default when this option is not set, and if there is a way to customize the exception handling behavior?'
      answer: |
       'The `exceptionHandler` option in the Apache Camel component Infinispan-Embedded allows you to use a custom ExceptionHandler. If the `bridgeErrorHandler` option is enabled, this option is not utilized. By default, when the `exceptionHandler` is not set, exceptions that are logged at WARN or ERROR level will be handled by the consumer and ignored. However, you can customize the exception handling behavior by providing an appropriate object for the `exceptionHandler` option in advanced consumer configurations.'
    - question: 'What is the default value and possible groups for using the "exchangePattern" option when configuring the Apache Camel component Infinispan-Embedded in the consumer section (advanced group)?'
      answer: |
       'The default value for setting the exchange pattern when configuring the Apache Camel component Infinispan-Embedded in the consumer section (advanced group) is null. The possible groups for using the "exchangePattern" option are "consumer (advanced)" group only.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default setting of the "defaultValue" option in the Apache Camel Infinispan-Embedded component when used with producer operations?'
      answer: |
       'The "defaultValue" option in the Apache Camel Infinispan-Embedded component, when utilized with producer operations, serves the purpose of assigning a specific default value for certain producer actions. By default, this option is set to null, meaning no default value is predefined. However, you may choose to override this by providing your own value, if desired. This feature can be found in the "producer" group within the component''s configuration settings.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "key" option in the Apache Camel Infinispan-Embedded component, and is it mandatory when using the producer?'
      answer: |
       'The "key" option in the Apache Camel Infinispan-Embedded component is used to specify a particular key for producer operations. This option is not mandatory as its default value is null, meaning that if no specific key is set, it will use a default one. It is primarily designed for situations where you want to store multiple entries under different keys within the same Infinispan cache instance using the producer.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "oldValue" option in the Apache Camel''s "infinispan-embedded" component, and is it necessary to use this option when configuring a producer with this component?'
      answer: |
       'The "oldValue" option in Apache Camel''s "infinispan-embedded" component serves to set a specific value for some producer operations that deal with data from a previous state, such as update or replace operations where you want to keep track of the original value before it is overwritten. However, its default value is null, meaning if you do not explicitly provide an old value, none will be used during operation execution. Its usage is optional and can be omitted when configuring a producer with this component if the need to retain old values does not apply to your use case.'
    - question: 'What is the default operation performed by the Apache Camel infinispan-embedded component when not specifically provided, within the producer group?'
      answer: |
       'The Apache Camel Infinispan-Embedded component, within the producer group, defaults to the PUT operation when no specific operation is provided.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "value" option within the Apache Camel component "infinispan-embedded", when using it with producer operations, and is it optional?'
      answer: |
       'The "value" option within the Apache Camel component "infinispan-embedded," used for producer operations, serves to set a specific value for your operation. By default, this option has no preset value ("defaultValue": null). It''s worth noting that the inclusion of this option is optional ("required": false) in your configuration. The group this option falls under is "producer."'
    - question: '"What is the purpose of the ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Apache Camel infinispan-embedded component, how does it affect the starting behavior of a producer, and what are its potential implications on the processing time and routing failures?"'
      answer: |
       'The ''lazyStartProducer'' option in the Apache Camel Infinispan-Embedded component allows for delaying the start of a producer during the CamelContext or route initialization process. By choosing this option, you can mitigate instances where a producer may fail during startup, potentially causing the route to fail as well.              In such situations, instead of the failure propagating at the start-up phase, the error handling will be managed by Camel''s routing error handlers when messages are being processed. However, you should note that deferring the producer startup will lead to a slight increase in overall processing time since the initial message processing requires the creation and startup of the producer. This may prolong the processing of the first message and potentially subsequent ones depending on how the rest of your routing setup is configured.              Additionally, you''ll find that this option belongs to the advanced group (producer) of configurations, indicating it might not be required for all scenarios but can provide helpful flexibility in complex routing architectures.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose of the ''cacheContainer'' option in the Apache Camel component "infinispan-embedded", and is it optional or required, with a default value set to null?'
      answer: |
       'The ''cacheContainer'' option in the Apache Camel component ''infinispan-embedded'' allows you to specify the Infinispan cache Container that your Camel route will connect to for caching data. This option is not mandatory, meaning it can be used but isn''t required for basic usage of the component. By default, the ''cacheContainer'' option has a value set to null in case you wish to use the default Infinispan cache container configuration or set up your own custom cache container instance later on.'
    - question: 'What is the default behavior and requirements of the "cacheContainerConfiguration" option when using the Apache Camel Infinispan-embedded component, and can it be omitted if I define my own cache container?'
      answer: |
       'The "cacheContainerConfiguration" option in the Apache Camel Infinispan-embedded component has no default value and is an optional configuration. It is used when you haven''t explicitly defined a cache container, serving as a default setup if needed. If you define your own cache container, it can be safely omitted in your configuration, as it only applies when no custom cache container is present. This option falls under the "advanced" group of configuration settings within Infinispan-embedded.'
    - question: 'How can I specify an implementation-specific URI for the CacheManager when using the Apache Camel Infinispan-embedded component, and is it required or optional?'
      answer: |
       'To specify an implementation-specific URI for the CacheManager while utilizing the Apache Camel Infinispan-embedded component, you can configure the "configurationUri" property of the InfinispanCacheManager bean in your route context XML or Java DSL configuration. This parameter is optional, meaning it''s not required if you don''t need to provide an implementation-specific URI. It belongs to the "advanced" configuration group and should be set as a string value.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "flags" option in the Apache Camel component "infinispan-embedded", and is it mandatory to provide a value for this option?'
      answer: |
       'The "flags" option within the Apache Camel component "infinispan-embedded" is an advanced configuration parameter that allows you to specify a comma-separated list of org.infinispan.context.Flag values to be applied by default on each cache invocation. By default, no flags are assigned to this option, meaning that it accepts null as the default value. Using this option is not mandatory; providing a value for "flags" is optional.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and usage of the `remappingFunction` option within the Apache Camel''s Infinispan-Embedded component, and does it have a default value when this option is not provided?'
      answer: |
       'The `remappingFunction` option in the Apache Camel''s Infinispan-Embedded component is an advanced feature that allows you to set a specific function to transform data during compute operations. This option is optional, meaning it isn''t required if you don''t need such transformation. When not provided, it will use its default value, which is `null`.'
    - question: 'What is the purpose and default value of the "resultHeader" option in the Apache Camel''s "infinispan-embedded" component, how can its value be overridden in a message header, and what specific message header should be used to override it when this option is not set by default?'
      answer: |
       'In Apache Camel''s "infinispan-embedded" component, the "resultHeader" option allows for storing the operation result in a message header rather than the message body. By default, it is set to null, meaning the query result is stored in the message body and any existing content in the message body is discarded. If you set resultHeader, the specified value will be used as the name of the header to store the query result and the original message body will be preserved. This value can be overridden by an in-message header named: CamelInfinispanOperationResultHeader.'
